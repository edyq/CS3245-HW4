  REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

  WHITLAM and GYLES JJ:

  1                     The short point of substance sought to be raised in this appeal is whether a doubt or question as to the fitness to plead of an accused who is convicted is a doubt or question as to his or her guilt within the meaning of s 475 of the Crimes Act 1900 (ACT) (“the Act”) as it stood at 7 August 2001. Although the point can be simply stated, the resolution of it is not simple. The interrelationship between fitness to plead and the criminal process has a long history, with different solutions at different times and in different places. It is interesting to observe that there are current controversies in the United Kingdom in relation to that topic in the light of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (R v Grant [2002] 2 WLR 1409).

  2                     Section 475 of the Act was as follows:

  “(1) Whenever, after the conviction of a prisoner, any doubt or question arises as to his or her guilt, or any mitigating circumstance in the case, or any portion of the evidence therein, the Executive, on the petition of the prisoner, or some person on his or her behalf, representing such doubt or question, or a judge of the Supreme Court of his or her own motion, may direct any magistrate to, and such magistrate may, summon and examine on oath all persons likely to give material information on the matter suggested.

  (2)              The attendance of every person so summoned may be enforced, and his or her examination compelled, and any false statement wilfully made by him or her shall be punishable in like manner as if he or she had been summoned by, or been duly sworn and examined before, the same magistrate, in a case lawfully pending before him or her.

  (3)              Where on such inquiry the character of any person who was a witness on the trial is affected thereby, the magistrate shall allow such person to be present, and to examine any witness produced before such magistrate.

  (4)              Every deposition taken under this section shall be stated in the commencement to have been so taken, and in reference to what case, and in pursuance of whose direction, mentioning the date thereof, and shall be transmitted by the magistrate, before whom the same was taken, as soon as shall be practicable, to the Executive if the inquiry was directed by him or her, or to the judge directing the inquiry, and the matter shall be disposed of, as to the Executive, on the report of such judge, or otherwise, shall appear to be just.”

  Background

  3                     David Harold Eastman (“Eastman”) was charged with the murder of Assistant Commissioner Winchester of the Australian Federal Police on 10 January 1989. The trial in the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, which was presided over by Carruthers A-J, commenced on 16 May 1995 and lasted for five and a half months, concluding with his conviction on 3 November 1995. During the trial Eastman exhibited erratic and unusual behaviour, and was unrepresented from time to time. None of Eastman, his various legal representatives, or prosecuting counsel raised any question during the trial as to his fitness to plead. The trial judge raised no such question, and, indeed, in the course of his remarks on sentence, described the applicant’s conduct as an attempt “to avoid the consequences of the damning nature of the Crown evidence by adopting a process of manipulating the trial process and attempting to frustrate its progression in any conventional manner”.

  4                     On appeal to this Court, numerous arguments were raised on behalf of Eastman but no issue was raised as to his fitness to plead. Indeed, counsel on his behalf expressly rejected any suggestion of mental illness which might bear on that question. The appeal was rejected: Eastman v The Queen (1997) 76 FCR 9. Eastman’s application for special leave to appeal to the High Court raised for the first time the question of his fitness to plead at the time of his trial. He sought leave to present evidence to the High Court on that issue. It was held that the High Court could not receive that further evidence. It was then argued that there was material before this Court such that it should have raised that issue of its own initiative. This argument was rejected. Special leave to appeal was granted, but the appeal was dismissed on 25 May 2000: Eastman v The Queen (2000) 203 CLR 1. The views expressed by certain of the Justices in that decision loomed large in the argument before us.

  5                     A document prepared by Eastman dated 9 June 2000, called “Petition”, and headed “Application for a Judicial Inquiry under Section 475 of the ACT Crimes Act 1900” was provided to the Supreme Court. It included:

  “A 4-3 majority of the High Court (Gaudron, Kirby, Hayne and Callinan) considered that the negative outcome of my appeal was ‘CLEARLY UNSATISFACTORY’ (see pages 26, 100, 115 and 147), and specific reference was made a Judicial Inquiry as one of the means of repairing this defect (see page 100).” (Emphasis in original.)

  and claimed that a judicial inquiry be set up.

  6                     The Registrar of the Supreme Court conveyed to Eastman, on behalf of the Chief Justice, the following:

  “1. The Chief Justice has made an administrative decision not to direct an inquiry under s 475.

  2.                  Your application relies upon the expression of opinion by three Judges of the High Court (and, possibly, a fourth, Justice Kirby) that the failure of your appeal was ‘clearly unsatisfactory’. The Chief Justice is not convinced that your application raises a doubt or question as to your guilt, or any relevant mitigating circumstances, or any portion of the evidence in your case, in respect of which it is appropriate to direct an inquiry.

  3. However, assuming that such doubt or question arises, you have the alternative of presenting your petition to the Executive. An inquiry under s 475 is conducted more appropriately at the direction of the Executive, which has the responsibility of the ultimate disposal of the matter.”

  7                     Eastman then directed a further communication to the Chief Justice on the topic of an inquiry pursuant to s 475, referring to what he called “further compelling evidence” under the following headings:

  (1)               “Psychiatric report of Dr Hugh Jolly dated 30 January 1998”,

  (2)               “Evidence of former Winchester murder inquiry detective, Cliff Forster”,

  (3)               “Evidence that organised crime committed the murder”, and

  (4)               “Forensic evidence of Robert Barnes is ‘unsafe’”.

  8                     The following appeared under the heading “Psychiatric Report of Dr Hugh Jolly dated 30-1-98”:

  “I attach a copy of this report, and I draw your attention especially to page 6, which states that I was unfit to plead during part of the trial. This opinion is supported by psychiatric reports of Dr Alan White and Dr Bruce Westmore dated April and October 1998 respectively. The former is contained in the High Court appeal books. The latter was commissioned by the DPP to contradict Dr White, but ended up substantially agreeing with him. I regret, due to lack of photocopying, that I cannot send you copies of these reports at this stage. The DPP has them.

  In addition, during my trial, the Prosecution had 13 psychiatric reports from Dr Rod Milton dated 1989-92 which raised at the very least a question as to my fitness to plead, pursuant to Sect 428E of the Crimes Act. The Prosecution failed to raise this issue with the trial judge, despite having a clear-cut duty to do so.” (Emphasis in original.)

  9                     The response of the Chief Justice was as follows:

  “1. With regard to the matters referred to under the heading ‘Psychiatric Report of Dr Hugh Jolly dated 30.1.98’, I have not yet been able to decide whether they raise a doubt or question under s 475, or whether, if they do, the doubt or question is of sufficient substance to justify directing an inquiry.

  2.                   In order to further consider the application I propose to instruct the Registrar to brief counsel to assist me at a hearing to take place in the Law Courts Building at 9.30 am on Thursday 12 July 2001. In the meantime I will receive and consider any further written submission which the applicant wishes to make. I will also consider, at the hearing, any application by a legal practitioner to appear and make submissions on behalf of the applicant or on behalf of the Attorney-General or on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The hearing may be adjourned from time to time.

  2.[sic] I have decided to decline to direct an inquiry into the matters referred to under the headings ‘Evidence of former Winchester murder inquiry detective, Cliff Forster’, ‘Evidence that organised crime committed the murder’ and ‘Forensic evidence of Robert Barnes is unsafe’.

  3.[sic] The grounds on which I have made the decision are as follows:

  The matters referred to add nothing of substance to the evidence in the trial as it was summarised in the judgment of the Full Court of the Federal Court in Eastman v The Queen.”

  10                  The hearing envisaged in that response took place on 12 July 2001, when counsel assisting appeared, together with counsel for the Attorney-General, a solicitor for Eastman and counsel for the Director of Public Prosecutions. Submissions had been made on behalf of all those parties. Eastman favoured an inquiry. The Attorney-General and the Director of Public Prosecutions opposed an inquiry, each arguing, inter alia, that fitness to plead did not raise a doubt or question as to guilt within the meaning of the section. Evidence was received by the Chief Justice.

  11                  On 7 August 2001 the Chief Justice made what were described as “Further Remarks” which included the following:

  “6. I have considered the submissions and the evidentiary material before me. The decision whether or not to direct an Inquiry under s 475 is an administrative one and not a judicial one. However, the direction may be lawfully given only in the circumstances provided for in the section. The material which may raise the sort of question or doubt contemplated by s 475 does not, in my view, go to the issue of whether David Harold Eastman murdered Colin Winchester on 10 January 1989. In that sense the material relevant to the question of fitness to plead is not relevant to guilt.

  7.                  However in the administration of criminal justice, and in the criminal law, the term ‘guilt’ is often used not to refer to objective guilt but to a finding of guilt. If a liberal approach is taken to s 475, then it is not difficult to construe the section to cover questions and doubts as to a finding of guilt. If a person has been found guilty when an issue as to that person’s fitness to plead has arisen at the trial but has not been determined according to law, then it follows that a question arises as to the finding of guilt. On the material before me the present application raises the question whether that issue arose at the trial of David Harold Eastman.

  8.                  It is less clear whether an undetermined issue of fitness to plead gives rise to any mitigating circumstances. In my view, the sorts of mitigating circumstances contemplated by s 475 are those which are relevant to the sentence passed in consequence of the conviction. Circumstances suggesting unfitness to plead are not relevant to the sentence, except in so far as they may also go to suggest that the person was suffering from some mental handicap at the time of the offence which reduces his/her moral responsibility. It may be appropriate that they be taken into account also for the purpose of considering the person’s ability to take part in the sentencing process post-trial. However, it is not necessary at this stage to consider this aspect further, since as I have already indicated I am satisfied that the material before me raises the issue of whether the question of the fitness of David Harold Eastman to plead arose at his trial. Consequently it raises also a doubt or question as to his guilt.

  9.                  The next matter for consideration is whether I make an administrative decision as to whether there should be a direction that an Inquiry take place. The submission of David Harold Eastman argues that ‘the psychiatric reports of Drs Jolly, White and Westmore provide prima facie evidence that he was, at times during the inquest and trial, unfit to plead, that this issue was never addressed in a substantive way during the trial or appeal process, that he was denied both a fair committal hearing (or equivalent) and a fair trial and that the matter is serious enough to warrant an inquiry under s 475’.

  10.              The strength of any doubt hanging over the conviction must be one factor. The cases refer to a feeling of ‘unease’ or a ‘sense of disquiet’ as being sufficient to justify an Inquiry. Another factor, in my view, is the likely outcome of any positive indication flowing from the Inquiry that a question as to unfitness to plead did in fact arise at the trial. The trial is over. At this time the Mental Health Tribunal clearly has no power to determine the question of fitness to plead even if it did arise at or during the trial and there is no power in the Court to order David Harold Eastman to submit to its jurisdiction.

  11.              As I have indicated the issue which brings the case within s 475 is not whether David Harold Eastman was in fact fit to plead but whether during his trial the question of fitness to plead arose. Should an Inquiry under s 475 attempt for itself look for an answer to the question whether David Harold Eastman was in fact unfit to plead? If it did, what would be the consequences of a positive answer that David Harold Eastman was in fact unfit to plead? It must be remembered that the Inquiry under s 475 results in a report to the Executive and nothing more. The Judge making the report has no power to set aside the conviction. The Executive would have no power to act on any recommendation that the conviction be set aside. The Minister would have no power to refer the case for determination as in an appeal, as may be done under the present Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and as used to be done under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). There is however the Executive prerogative of mercy. There would also appear to be the unexplored scope of s 474 of the Crimes Act.

  12.              Ultimately I do not consider it appropriate to consider further the effect of the outcome of any Inquiry. It is enough to say that an Inquiry would not be necessarily futile and that there is a prospect that it might on the one hand go to expose a serious injustice or on the other it might go to clear any doubt and resolve any question as to David Harold Eastman’s guilt as contemplated by s 475.

  13.              I therefore propose to direct the Chief Magistrate, or a Magistrate nominated by him, to summon and examine on oath all persons likely to give material information on the matter of the fitness to plead of David Harold Eastman during the whole or any part of his trial for the murder of Colin Winchester. I propose also to direct the Magistrate concerned to consult me as to the identity of persons likely to give material information and generally as to the procedure to be followed in the Inquiry. I request the Attorney-General to provide independent counsel to be instructed by the Registrar of the Supreme Court or of the Magistrates Court for the purpose of assisting the Inquiry.”

  12                  On the same day the Chief Justice wrote to the Chief Magistrate of the Australian Capital Territory in the following terms:

  “Dear Mr Cahill

  Application by David Harold Eastman for Inquiry

  under Section 475 of the Crimes Act 1900

  David Harold Eastman has made application for an Inquiry under s 475 of the Crimes Act 1900 into his conviction for murder on 3 November 1995.

  I am of the view that a question or doubt arises as to his guilt. The question is whether the question of fitness to plead arose at his trial.

  I therefore direct you, or a Magistrate nominated by you, to summon and examine on oath all persons likely to give material information on the matter of the fitness to plead of David Harold Eastman during the whole or any part of his trial.

  I request that you, or the Magistrate nominated, consult me as to the identity of persons likely to give material information and generally as to the procedure to be followed in the Inquiry.

  I have requested the Attorney-General to provide independent counsel to be instructed by the Registrar of the Supreme Court or of the Magistrates Court for the purpose of assisting the Inquiry. This is a matter which I suggest be the subject of consultation between yourself and myself at a later stage.

  Yours sincerely,

  [Sgd] Jeffrey Miles

  CHIEF JUSTICE”

  13                  Thereafter the Chief Magistrate nominated Mr Ian Pike (“the Magistrate”) to act as the magistrate pursuant to s 475. The Magistrate took various steps preparatory to receiving evidence.

  Proceedings in the Supreme Court

  14                  On 20 March 2002 the Director of Public Prosecutions (ACT) (“the Director”) commenced two proceedings in the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. The first named the Chief Justice as the first defendant, Eastman as the second defendant and the Magistrate as the third defendant. The relief sought was:

  “(a) A declaration that the inquiry, directed on 7 August 2001 to be conducted under s 475 Crimes Act 1900 into the matter of the fitness to plead of the First Defendant [sic] at the whole or any part of his trial for the murder of Colin Winchester, and proposed to be conducted by the Second Defendant [sic], was not authorised by the enactment under which it was purported to be made;

  (b)          An order restraining the Second Defendant [sic] from conducting the inquiry, directed on 7 August 2001 to be conducted under s 475 Crimes Act 1900 into the matter of the fitness to plead of the First Defendant [sic] at the whole or any part of his trial for the murder of Colin Winchester, and proposed to be conducted by him.”

  15                  The second proceeding was an application for an order of review, with the Director as the applicant and the same persons respondents as were defendants to the first action. The relief claimed was:

  “1. An order pursuant to Sub-paragraph 17(1)(a) of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1989, quashing or setting aside the decision of the First Respondent to direct a Magistrate to conduct the inquiry.”

  16                  The Director claimed to be aggrieved because:

  “1. The Applicant instituted and conducted the prosecution of the Second Respondent on indictment for the said offence;

  2. The inquiry directed by the First Respondent calls into question, amongst other things, the conduct of the said prosecution by the Applicant;

  3. Depositions taken in the inquiry may call into question the conduct of the prosecution of the Second Respondent;

  4. Any report made by the First Respondent under Sub-section 475(4) Crimes Act 1900 may call into question the conduct of the prosecution of the Second Respondent;

  (5)               Any disposition of the matter by the Executive pursuant that sub-section, may affect the sentence which was passed upon the Second Respondent at the end of the prosecution.”

  17                  The grounds of the application were:

  “1. That the First Respondent was not authorised by the enactment under which he purported to make the direction, namely under Section 475(1) Crimes Act 1900, to make the direction, …

  2.                  The decision of the First Respondent to make the direction involved an error of law, …”

  The basis of each ground (although put in various ways) was that fitness to plead did not touch upon or raise a doubt or question as to the guilt of Eastman or any mitigating circumstance in the case or any portion of the evidence therein. The proceeding was well out of time.

  18                  Each of the proceedings was ultimately amended to somewhat re-order the parties, so that, respectively, Eastman was the first defendant and first respondent, the Magistrate was the second defendant and second respondent, the Attorney-General was given leave to intervene and was the third defendant and third respondent, the Chief Justice was the fourth defendant and fourth respondent, and the relief claimed was amended accordingly. Each defendant/respondent was represented at the hearing, Eastman appearing for himself. At that hearing evidence was led as to the factual background of the matter, as to the position of the Director and as to the delay which had occurred in commencing proceedings. There was cross-examination of the Director by Eastman. The relief sought was opposed by Eastman and by the Attorney-General, reversing the position which had been put by the Attorney-General to the Chief Justice.

  19                  The judge of the Supreme Court who heard the proceedings considered the question of law as to the construction of s 475 at the outset, taking the view that he would only turn to questions as to the appropriateness of the proceedings and the remedies sought should he have been persuaded that the Chief Justice was not empowered to decide as he did. In the event, the judge agreed with the Chief Justice and thus did not come to those other questions.

  20                  After considering the history of s 475 and like provisions, and relevant authorities, the conclusion to which his Honour came was expressed as follows:

  “44. I am more inclined to think that the words used to convey the circumstances for the provision to operate were each descriptive of aspects of the trial and that ‘guilt’ encompasses the verdict that results from that process, just as mitigating circumstances and portion of the evidence are part of that process.

  45.              Having also made the potential subject of an inquiry ‘any portion of the evidence therein’, I do not think that the legislature was unmindful of the verdict and its relevance to such an inquiry. …

  46.              … it is the trial process which is under scrutiny in each of the circumstances which might give rise to the operation of s 475. In most cases I agree that this will measure the evidence given at the trial with other material, but I do not think that this was intended to be exclusive or to make unreviewable matters which might affect the ultimate verdict.”

  21                  On 3 May 2002 the Supreme Court made the following orders:

  “1. The application to extend time for the making of an order for review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1989 in respect of the decision of the Chief Justice made on 7 August 2001 in respect of David Harold Eastman pursuant to s 475 of the Crimes Act 1900 be refused.

  2. The applications for a declaration and injunction in respect of that decision be dismissed.”

  22                  Proceedings by Eastman for review of the decision of the Chief Justice to decline to direct an inquiry into guilt on the bases put forward by him other than fitness to plead have not yet been resolved in the Supreme Court.

  proceedings on appeal

  23                  The Director appealed to this Court and sought an order restraining the Magistrate from proceeding further until the disposition of the appeal. As the Magistrate had intended commencing hearing at least preliminary matters on 17 June and to commence examining witnesses shortly thereafter, the appeal was expedited and the Magistrate restrained from proceeding in the meantime. At the hearing of the appeal, the burden of contradiction was taken by Mr Mossop, counsel for the Attorney-General. Mr Harris of counsel, who appeared for the Chief Justice and the Magistrate, made some submissions to clarify the course of events and what was proposed, but did not enter upon the substantive debate.

  24                  Eastman was not represented at the hearing of the appeal. It is unnecessary to go into detail here as to the reasons for this beyond saying that he declined to appear unless collateral matters which he wished to raise were dealt with before the appeal. We should make it clear that it was not regarded as inappropriate for him to raise prior to the commencement of the hearing one of those matters, namely, disqualification of the judges sitting on the appeal. One result of this is that no party before the Court has sought to argue any procedural difficulty in the path of the Director’s appeal. It will be recalled that such issues as arose in the Supreme Court were put to one side by the judge, and there are other procedural issues involved in the appeal itself. As, in substance, the direction by the Chief Justice which is in question in these proceedings was the result of a request by Eastman, and as Eastman opposed the relief sought by the Director in the Supreme Court and is in no sense a consenting party to the appeal (albeit he has chosen to absent himself), it would not be right to ignore the procedural issues which exist. Indeed, it must be borne in mind that the issue of substance being considered is a doubt as to whether Eastman was fit to plead at his trial in 1995. If he were not fit to plead at his trial, it would not lightly be supposed that incarceration during the ensuing years would have improved his condition. That leaves it open to question as to whether he is fit to make decisions about the conduct of this litigation. In this connection, it may not be irrelevant to note that his conduct before the Court when the application to restrain the proceedings by the Magistrate was considered was similar in kind to that described in the account of the original trial. For this reason, members of the Court raised the procedural issues with counsel for the Director in the course of the appeal.

  25                  The most fundamental of the procedural issues is the standing of the Director. There are two aspects to this. The first is whether the Director has power to bring either set of proceedings. The second is whether, if there is power, the Director was a person aggrieved within the meaning of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1989 (ACT) (“the ADJR Act”) by the decision in question, and if the answer is “no”, what are the consequences for the proceedings for declaratory and injunctive relief?

  26                  Prior to considering these questions, we should make it clear that the actual decision in question is that reflected in the third paragraph of the communication from the Chief Justice to the Chief Magistrate, so that the topic of the examination on oath of persons is “the matter of the fitness to plead of David Harold Eastman during the whole or any part of his trial”. That is the question or doubt which has been suggested by the Chief Justice and upon which a report will be made to the Executive. That conclusion accords with the common submission of all those represented on the appeal and is plainly correct. The fact that Eastman may not accept that the function of the Magistrate and the Chief Justice is so limited is not to the point. It is no part of the function of the Magistrate or of the Chief Justice to examine persons as to the conduct of those concerned with or related to the trial as such. It may be, of course, that such persons might be able to give material information on the matter of fitness to plead, but that does not make the conduct of any such person a topic of investigation, inquiry or report.

  Power of Director

  …

  Part 4 Miscellaneous

  35 The Executive may make regulations for this Act.”

  28                  At the relevant time, reg 3 of the Director of Public Prosecutions Regulations 1991 made pursuant to s 35 of the DPP Act included the following:

  “3. For the purpose of paragraph 6 (1) (j) of the Act the following functions are prescribed:

  (a) instituting or responding to, or conducting, on behalf of the Territory or any other person as the appellant, applicant or respondent, an appeal, application or review (including administrative review) arising out of proceedings referred to in paragraph 6 (1) (b) of the Act;

  …”

  29                  It was submitted on behalf of the Director (as it had been in the Supreme Court) that the provisions of s 6(1)(p) and s 18 are sufficient to provide the power to institute and conduct (and respond to) proceedings by way of applications for judicial review of decisions made under s 475 of the Act. Stress is laid upon the width of the expressions in those sections, particularly s 18, of the DPP Act. Appeal was made to the cases which have considered the effect of s 51(xxxix) of the Constitution to support the width of what might be called the incidental power of the Director. In our view, those constitutional cases have little to say about the present problem.

  30                  We do not doubt the width of what might be called the incidental powers in relation to the performance of the functions of the Director. However, we can see no function of the Director which has any direct connection with a criminal proceeding once completed, in the sense that all appeals have been exhausted. We do not agree that he has any general role to uphold convictions. Furthermore, the Director does not have any roving commission to represent the Executive government or the public interest in relation to criminal law in the Australian Capital Territory. The Director has only those statutory functions vested in him. Any wider role would generally be the function of the Attorney-General or the Executive government as a whole. It is illuminating to appreciate that a principal plank in the argument for the Director on the question of validity was that there was no curial remedy arising out of s 475 of the DPP Act, that the function being exercised by the Chief Justice was purely administrative, and the response depended entirely upon the Executive government. The Director does not represent the Executive government in that sense. It has not been suggested that s 475 involved any appeal or right of appeal within the meaning of s 10 of the DPP Act and it clearly did not.

  31                  This is not to say that circumstances may not arise after appeals are exhausted where the Director might have power to act. For example, if there were an external inquiry into the conduct of a completed prosecution by the Office of the Director (“the Office”), or if the Director or member or former member of the Office were called to give evidence to such an inquiry, would his statutory functions would run far enough to enable a challenge to be made to the validity of such an inquiry? The issue of power is best tested by assuming invalidity of the s 475 direction. In the present case, the evidence before the Supreme Court makes it apparent that it is inevitable that some former officers of the Office, and perhaps the former Director, will be called upon to give information on oath to the Magistrate as to the fitness to plead of Eastman during his trial. Indeed, the Director has been given leave to appear. If the topic of the inquiry and report was the conduct of the prosecution of Eastman by the then Director, in our opinion there would be power in the current Director to seek to restrain such an inquiry. Whilst the constitution of an “office” without corporate personality is unusual and shadowy, it is a sufficient indication that there is continuity of an organisation such that it would be necessary and convenient that the present Director should have the power to defend former Directors and officers from an invalid inquiry into their conduct if so advised pursuant to s 6(1)(p) and s 18 of the DPP Act.

  32                  We have held that the Magistrate is not entitled to conduct such an inquiry. However, counsel for the Director submits that the distinction between such an inquiry and that which is proposed is more apparent than real for present purposes, even assuming that the proposed inquiry is kept within proper bounds by the Magistrate. The Magistrate, counsel assisting, and those cross-examining will be able to fully test the extent of knowledge of personnel of the Office as to the fitness of Eastman over a period of many months before and during the trial and doing so will inevitably, no doubt, involve to some extent an examination of the processes of the Office as well as the extent of involvement of individual officers. With some hesitation, it seems to us that, as suggested by counsel for the Director, the distinction is too fine. At the least, the current Director has a legitimate interest in the confidentiality of the conduct of a previous prosecution by the Office and the modus operandi of the Office during the time of a previous Director. That confidentiality will be disturbed, if not lost, by the inquiry. Further, the current Director is responsible for the records of the Office in relation to former prosecutions. Production of some or all of those records will, no doubt, be sought. The Director should have power to seek to resist such demands for production if he deems it appropriate. In our opinion, the Director has power to commence and pursue each proceeding and this appeal. It should be clear that we have only considered the scope of the statutory incidental power of the Director. It is entirely a matter for the Director as to whether bringing the proceedings is an appropriate use of the power. It should also be clear that affirming the existence of the power to bring the proceedings does not involve any implication that, leaving aside the scope of s 475 of the Act, there cannot be or should not be an inquiry involving a past or present Director or past or present officers of the Office.

  Other Procedural Issues

  Person Aggrieved?

  33                  The ADJR Act provides that a person who is aggrieved by a decision may make application pursuant to the Act and reference to a person aggrieved by a decision includes reference to a person whose interests are adversely affected by the decision (s 3(4)(a)(i); s 5(1)). Counsel for the Director referred to the decision of the Full Court in Ogle v Strickland (1987) 13 FCR 306 as establishing the width of these concepts. The circumstances as to the proposed inquiry to which we have referred when discussing power would also indicate that the interests of the Office, and so the Director, are affected in the relevant sense.

  Declaration

  34                  Although the proceedings seek an injunction, that relief was and is not pressed because of the identity of the respondents. Counsel for the Director confirms that the only utility of that proceeding would be in the event that leave to extend time to make the application under the ADJR Act were not granted on a basis which did not deal with the substance of the argument. It was submitted for the Attorney-General in the Supreme Court that such use of a declaration would be an abuse of process. Whether that be so or not, it is a discretionary remedy and there would be powerful reasons against making any declaration simply to avoid the statutory time limit. The grant of a declaration is not ordinary or usual relief where an extant administrative decision is being challenged. Section 34B of the Supreme Court Act 1933 (ACT) and O 55 of the Supreme Court Rules 1937 deal with the conventional administrative law remedies.

  Leave to Appeal Required?

  35                  The order of the Supreme Court dismissing the proceeding for a declaration was not an interlocutory order, but a final order, and there is an appeal as of right. However, as we have pointed out, there are discretionary reasons against granting the relief sought. It is contended for the Director that the refusal of the extension of time and the consequent dismissal of the proceeding under the ADJR Act were not interlocutory orders but, rather, finally disposed of the proceeding so as to give rise to an appeal as of right, citing Paramasivam v Flynn (1998) 90 FCR 489 at 493. In our opinion, the passage referred to in that case is, at best, equivocal on the topic and did not settle the question which arose in that case. We add that the question which arose in that case is not the same as that which arises here. An application for an extension of time to commence proceedings of the type considered in that case is an application in itself, rather than being a step in another proceeding. There are many authorities as to what orders are interlocutory to which we have not been referred and we are far from persuaded that leave is not necessary to appeal against the dismissal of the ADJR Act proceeding. Counsel for the Director did ultimately indicate that, if necessary, he applied orally for leave to appeal, and no other party who was represented raised any objection, although Eastman was not represented at the hearing.

  36                  The Supreme Court did not deal with the question as to whether time to bring the ADJR Act proceeding should be extended as such, and dismissed the proceeding because it was held that the main proceeding would not have succeeded in any event on the merits. There are a number of discretionary considerations which might have told against the grant of any extension of time, including the substantial delay, the lack of any substantial prejudice or interference with the interests of the Director even if there was standing, the repeal of s 475, the arguable nature of the point of substance, the concerns about the administration of criminal justice which are contained in the judgments of some of the Justices of the High Court in Eastman v The Queen and possible injustice to Eastman.

  37                  However, if the direction of the Chief Justice was not authorised by s 475 there would be compelling reasons for the grant of relief, and if there is a serious doubt about that authority there are compelling reasons for prompt resolution of the issue in the public interest. The Magistrate is about to embark upon what purports to be the compulsory examination of witnesses on oath. Many witnesses would, no doubt, prefer not to be examined in this way, either in whole or in part. It is inevitable that much that would otherwise be confidential will be disclosed. It is inevitable that much that will be said by witnesses and those examining them will be defamatory. The report by the Chief Justice is also likely to disclose much that would otherwise be confidential, and is likely to be defamatory of some persons at least. If the direction was not authorised, and the inquiry is beyond power, irretrievable loss of confidential information and reputation may have occurred, and many who participate will risk incurring liability as a consequence.

  38                  In our opinion, none of the procedural issues preclude the substance of the appeal being considered.

  construction of section 475

  Argument for the Appellant

  39                  Counsel for the appellant developed his comprehensive written submissions in oral argument under five headings:

  1. The ordinary meaning of the word “guilt” in s 475(1). It was submitted that the ordinary meaning of the word “guilt” necessarily involves complicity in the crime charged, whereas fitness to plead is only an aspect of the trial process and has nothing to do with guilt in the ordinary sense of the word. In this connection, counsel referred to the history of the manner in which fitness to plead has been dealt with up to and including the present time, both in the Australian Capital Territory and elsewhere.

  2. Absence of a remedy. It was submitted that if it were found that Eastman was unfit to plead during the trial there is no remedy available to the Executive government to repair the situation. The remedies which are available to the Executive government are the grant of a pardon or the remission in whole or part of the sentence. Neither is adapted to deal with unfitness to plead.

  3. The mechanism chosen. The way in which s 475 works is not consistent with irregularities in the trial process being the topic for investigation. The magistrate merely obtains information which, if the Executive directed the inquiry, is presented to the Executive without any judicial intervention. Even in the case where a judge directs the inquiry, it is odd that the magistrate is chosen as the person to inquire if the topic for inquiry is irregularities in the trial on indictment in the Supreme Court.

  4. The history of s 475 and the New South Wales equivalent and the extrinsic materials relevant to that history. These, it was said, support the conclusion that “guilt” involves complicity in the crime charged.

  5. Various judicial and extrajudicial statements by judges concerning s 475 (or, more particularly, the New South Wales equivalent) which used language consistent with the section authorising an inquiry into conviction, particularly those relied upon by the Supreme Court. The gist of counsel’s submission was that none of those statements was made in a context in which the present question was squarely raised, and certainly not in a context in which a s 475 inquiry was limited to an aspect of the trial process.

  Argument for the Attorney-General

  40                  Counsel for the Attorney-General supported the reasoning of the Supreme Court. It was submitted that there is no such thing as “guilt” in the abstract so far as the criminal law is concerned, and that “guilt” must mean guilt found at the particular proceeding which led to the conviction so that “guilt” in s 475 should be understood in the sense of a finding of guilt. So construed, a doubt or question as to whether there was a fundamental flaw in the trial process would amount to a question or doubt about guilt as the accused should not have been found guilty.

  41                  Counsel undertook a helpful analysis of the judgments in Eastman in the High Court in order to establish the proposition that those judgments had identified a potentially serious injustice which the appellate process was not capable of remedying, and submitted that this was the very kind of situation which should be covered by a beneficial reading of s 475. It was said that a majority of the High Court considered that the further evidence which was sought to be tendered in the High Court did give rise to a doubt or question as to Eastman’s fitness to plead during the trial, although a majority held that that evidence could not be received by the High Court. There were also at least three Justices who took the view that, even without that further evidence, there were sufficient indications before this Court on appeal to establish a doubt or question as to Eastman’s fitness to plead. It was submitted that it was apparent that the Chief Justice had concentrated his attention upon whether a real doubt or question had arisen and, although he had not been prepared to make that finding purely upon the High Court decision, he was persuaded to do so by the further information provided by Eastman, principally, no doubt, the report of Dr Jolly. Once he had reached that conclusion, it was apparent that there was a real question as to the administration of criminal justice in the Australian Capital Territory with which the appellate system was not able to cope, and that Eastman might have been improperly found guilty because the trial should not have proceeded. That question having arisen, the method of endeavouring to set it to rest was by inquiring into the actual fitness to plead of Eastman. Information obtained by virtue of the inquiry, and analysis of it by the Chief Justice, might enable conclusions to be drawn one way or another as to the fitness to plead of Eastman during his trial. If fit to plead, then the doubt about conviction would be resolved. If it was concluded that Eastman were unfit to plead, then the Executive would need to consider what to do about it. The question of pardon or otherwise in those circumstances was entirely a matter for the Executive. In any event, the Executive could propose a legislative solution to the problem such as had occurred in the Chamberlain case (see the explanation in Re Conviction of Chamberlain (1988) 93 FLR 239 particularly per Nader J at 241-242).

  42                  It was submitted that no authority would stand in the way of the construction of s 475 found by the Supreme Court and that such construction was supported by statements in the authorities referred to in the Supreme Court and by the approach of judges of the New South Wales Supreme Court who had acted as justices of the peace under the equivalent New South Wales section.

  Argument for the Chief Justice and the Magistrate

  43                  Counsel did not present any separate argument on validity, but did support the analysis of counsel for the Attorney-General of the Eastman decision in the High Court and of the approach taken by the Chief Justice. He also confirmed that the inquiry would be confined to the actual fitness to plead of Eastman.

  Conclusion

  44                  In considering the discussion which follows, it needs to be borne in mind that the Chief Justice did not refer to the other limbs of s 475, namely, mitigating circumstances or part of the evidence, in his remarks, and neither has been relied upon by the Supreme Court or in argument before this Court. We will also refer to the result of the direction under s 475 as being an inquiry followed by a report.

  45                  We have no difficulty in accepting that the Chief Justice was, and was entitled to be, satisfied that there is a doubt or question as to whether Eastman should have been convicted at his trial, as there is a question or doubt as to his fitness to plead during the trial. There is no issue about those matters in these proceedings. We also have no difficulty in accepting that, that being so, it was an appropriate case to direct an inquiry pursuant to s 475 if the section permitted it. Again, there is no issue about that in these proceedings. We need not rehearse the analysis by counsel for the Attorney-General in support of these propositions, nor conduct any detailed analysis of our own of the various judgments in Eastman in the High Court. The only question is whether, acknowledging that the doubt which exists about the justice of the conviction cannot be resolved by appeal, this can be cured by a direction pursuant to s 475.

  46                  We can appreciate that an affirmative answer to that question may be seen to provide a ready and convenient solution to what might otherwise be seen as a stain upon the administration of justice in the Australian Capital Territory in these very unusual circumstances. It is but a short step to say that a beneficial construction of a remedial provision, not precluded by authority, should be adopted in order to achieve that result. However, that short step involves negotiating a crevice of some magnitude. If the judgment of the Supreme Court is correct, then s 475 had always encompassed all cases in which there is a credible allegation of a defect or irregularity in the conduct of the trial (and presumably the process of bringing the accused to trial) which, if established, might lead to the conviction being regarded as unsafe or unsatisfactory. In other words, it would be a backstop against any form of injustice in relation to the criminal process which might have led to a conviction which should not have occurred. Although s 475 and its New South Wales equivalent have been repealed and another, more detailed, set of provisions substituted, the question in issue here is by no means academic (see s 422(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900 (ACT); s 474C(2), s 474E(2) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)).

  47                  The conclusion which we have reached is that an inquiry and report which is limited to the fitness to plead of an accused person who has been convicted is not authorised by s 475. Put another way, a doubt or question restricted to fitness of the accused to plead is not a doubt or question as to the guilt of that person. It does not follow that questions of fitness to plead (or other procedural irregularities) are necessarily excluded from an inquiry pursuant to s 475. This is not because the inquiry becomes an inquiry into the trial process, as on an application for a new trial, but, rather, because the procedural irregularity may throw light upon the facts and circumstances which it is necessary to understand in order to assess a doubt about guilt. For example, fitness to plead could conceivably be relevant to understanding why particular evidence was or was not led at the trial, or why particular lines of cross-examination were not pursued. There could also be cases in which the mental state of the accused at the time of the trial may be relevant in assessing the mental state of the accused at the time the offence was alleged to have been committed. The Supreme Court relied upon passages from the 1985 report by Wood J of the New South Wales Supreme Court sitting as a justice of the peace in an inquiry pursuant to s 475 into the convictions of Anderson, Alister and Dunn, which were again relied upon by counsel for the Attorney-General in argument. Those passages and their full context are too lengthy to warrant setting out. In our opinion, those remarks have been misunderstood. His Honour discusses how the process of investigation and of the trial were interrelated with the question of guilt which was being examined in the circumstances of that case. This illustrates the principle which applies. It is not necessary to consider the manner in which that principle was applied in the detailed circumstances of that case.

  48                  In our view, the argument on behalf of the Director is substantially correct in each of its integers. The ordinary meaning of the word “guilt” relates to the accused having committed the crime in question. If it had been intended that the section would pick up errors or irregularities in the process by which the conviction took place, it would be expected that the legislature would have said “whenever any doubt or question arises as to the said conviction”.

  49                  The development of the law concerning fitness to plead, including relevant authorities, was recently traced in the judgment of Wood CJ at CL in R v Mailes (2001) 53 NSWLR 251 at 273-293 [112]-[203]. See also R v Judge Martin; Ex parte Attorney-General [1973] VR 339. At common law, those unfit to be tried were liable to be kept in indeterminate detention at the pleasure of the Executive. As the historical surveys in both Mailes and Judge Martin show, there have been different statutory regimes established at different times to deal with the issue. However, the question of fitness to plead has never been relevant to guilt of the crime charged and, indeed, would be irrelevant and inadmissible as to that issue. Indeed, it has been said on occasion that a jury which has decided the question of fitness to plead should not decide the question of guilt.

  50                  We regard the absence of remedy in relation to any procedural irregularity found to have occurred to be a telling point made by counsel for the Director. In modern times, the remedy for a trial irregularity is a new trial or, in the case of lack of fitness to plead, compliance with whatever statutory regime is in force at the time. A new trial cannot be ordered by the Executive. The statutory regime as to fitness to plead constituted by Pt 11A of the Act would not be applicable. We do not regard the possibility that the Executive might propose legislation as being a remedy in the relevant sense. That step does not involve any power of the Executive which can operate in the individual case. Furthermore, legislation can be proposed by any member of the legislature on the suggestion of any member of the public. If an inquiry in order to consider legislation were in prospect, it would be expected that the Executive would utilise such tools as the Inquiries Act 1991 (ACT) or the Royal Commissions Act1991 (ACT). Incidentally, that was the course which was taken in the Chamberlain matter to which reference was made by counsel for the Attorney-General. Furthermore, the historical material to which we shall refer supports the proposition that the purpose of the section was to aid the Executive in the exercise of the powers it did have in relation to pardon and remission of sentence.

  51                  We agree with the submission that the mechanism chosen by the legislature points to the obtaining of information relevant to the commission of the crime, rather than information relevant to a review of the regularity of the conduct of a trial on indictment before a jury in the Supreme Court. The procedure laid down by s 475 is rather like the role of a magistrate at a committal hearing, and is singularly inappropriate for the kind of review of the regularity of proceedings at a trial which a court of criminal appeal might now undertake.

  52                  If any doubt remained as to the proper construction of the section taking these factors into account (and we do not think that there does), in our opinion, it would be set at rest if the history of the section and extrinsic material in relation to it were considered. Although the Court was referred to a number of sources relevant to that issue, it is unnecessary for present purposes to go beyond the account given in the judgment of Hope JA in Varley v Attorney-General (NSW) (1987) 8 NSWLR 30 at 43-47. Of particular significance in that account is the following quotation from the second reading speech when the predecessor of s 475 was originally enacted:

  “… Clause 383 contains an important provision. In cases of capital offence, especially where the victim is a female, representations are frequently made to the Government – after the person charged with the offence has been found guilty – which reflect on the character, the honor, or the chastity of the prosecutrix, or some of the witnesses on her behalf. As the law stands at present the Government have not the power to institute inquiries on oath to ascertain whether the imputations or reflections are or are not well-founded. The clause provides: (cl 383(1) was read).

  This appears to me to afford much more solid ground on which the Executive may proceed when they have to deal with capital cases where doubts are thrown on the character of persons connected with them.”

  53                  In this matter in the Supreme Court the judge referred in his reasons to other passages from the judgment of Hope JA in Varley as follows:

  “21. In his discussion of the provision, Hope JA, at 45, referred to the description of O’Connor J in White v The King (1906) 4 CLR 152 at 165 as to the objects of the section:

  ‘…The object of the new provision was to enable the case to be re-opened where no point had been reserved at the trial, but some facts had come to the notice of the Government indicating that the prisoner might have been improperly convicted, and also to enable the Crown, where the prisoner’s sentence had been served, and he appeared to have been unjustly convicted, to give him the opportunity of having his character cleared by a public proceeding.’

  Hope JA also observed, at 46:

  ‘Section 475 is a remedial section, and consequently should be construed beneficially. This well-known principle does not of course mean that courts can construe a statute so as to achieve a result which they think the legislature should have enacted; it means that they should construe the statute to give the fullest effect to the legislation’s intention to remedy the mischief aimed at which the language of the statute will allow.

   

  The principal mischief to which the provision was directed seems clear enough. Both in 1883 and in 1900, there was no way in which any doubt or question concerning a conviction or a resulting sentence could be effectively investigated. The Crown could arrange for an inquiry to be held, but there was no statutory basis for doing so, there could be no public inquiry, evidence could not be given on oath and persons could not be compelled to provide information. No doubt since it was established the appellate system has been able to handle many of these problems, but subject to the operation of an appellate system the Crown might be faced with a possible injustice to a convicted person which it could not deal with satisfactorily, and there would be no effective means available to the convicted person to seek to have his name cleared.’

  Later, Hope JA described the application of the section to the case before him, at 48:

  ‘To initiate an inquiry in the present case, a doubt must arise as to the guilt of the plaintiff. This doubt need not be shown to the satisfaction of the Governor or the Court to be well-founded; that is a matter for the inquiry. To adopt the language of Nagle CJ at CL in Varley v Attorney-General of New South Wales (at 12), ‘the section envisages the placing of any material before a Judge of the Supreme Court (Supreme Court Act 1970, s 40) … or, in a petition, before the Governor … which might cause him, for want of a better word ‘unease’ in allowing a conviction to stand’.’”

  54                  At the time of the introduction of s 475, there was only a rudimentary system of appeals from conviction and so there were no means of remedy in the hands of the Court in cases in which there may have been such doubt about the guilt in the ordinary sense of the person convicted such that the conviction ought not, in justice, to stand. The only remedy in such a case lay with the Executive power of pardon. The deficiencies in obtaining the information necessary to consider use of that power are referred to in the passages cited above. The development of a sophisticated and comprehensive appellate regime in criminal cases in the Australian Capital Territory and Australia generally in the ensuing years would not, in our opinion, support the view that the scope of s 475 would be widened now compared with its original scope. Indeed, rather the contrary would be the natural conclusion.

  55                  It is true that in the passages from Varley to which we have referred, and some of the passages from other cases referred to by counsel for the Attorney-General and by the Supreme Court, the section has been spoken of, in general terms, as relating to an inquiry into conviction. This, of course, is correct so far as it goes. Unless there has been a conviction, the section has no operation. It is the nature of the inquiry which is at issue and, in our opinion, none of the statements to which reference has been made focus upon an inquiry which does not involve a question or doubt as to guilt in the ordinary sense. We have already referred to the report on the convictions of Anderson, Alister and Dunn by Wood J (as he then was). The direction pursuant to s 475 in respect of which his Honour was acting as a justice of the peace related to guilt in the ordinary sense, although, as we have pointed out, his Honour looked at aspects of the trial process as part of that more general inquiry. In the present case, a general inquiry into the guilt of Eastman has been declined. If the Attorney-General remains of the view that there ought to be an inquiry, then consideration will no doubt be given as to whether it is appropriate to use other means to achieve that result.

  proposed orders

  56                  We would propose that the applicant Director of Public Prosecutions be granted leave to appeal from the judgment and orders of the Supreme Court in proceedings number SC 149 of 2002 made 3 May 2002, that the appeal be allowed, that the orders of the Supreme Court be set aside and in lieu thereof it be ordered that (1) the time for lodging of the application for an order for review under the ADJR Act in respect of the decision of the Chief Justice made on 7 August 2001 be extended to 21 March 2002 and (2) that decision be set aside. In view of the identity of the various parties, we would make no order for costs, but would grant leave to any party to apply in relation to costs provided the motion is filed and served within fourteen days of the date of the orders.

  57                  We would dismiss the appeal from the judgment and orders of the Supreme Court in matter number SC 148 of 2002 and make no order for costs. That proceeding has no utility in view of the orders which have been made in relation to Supreme Court matter number SC 149 of 2002.

GORDON J.   The appellant was charged with one count of rape.  He was tried in 
the  District  Court  of  Queensland  by  judge  and  jury.    After  the  jury  retired  to 
consider its verdict, the trial judge received a note from the jury which disclosed 
interim  votes  of  the  jury  and  the  voting  pattern  for  each  disclosed  interim  vote.  
The trial judge told counsel that the note indicated that the jury was not in total 
agreement  but  the  trial  judge  did  not  disclose  to  counsel  those  interim  votes  or 
interim  voting  patterns.    Did  the  failure  of  the  trial  judge  to  inform  counsel  of 
those interim votes and interim voting patterns constitute a denial  of procedural 
fairness?  The answer to that question is no.   

 
There was no denial of procedural fairness.  The interim votes and interim 
voting  patterns  of  the  jury  were  not  relevant  to  the  future  conduct  of  the  trial.  
What  was  relevant  to  the  issue  before  the  court  about  the  future  conduct  of  the 
trial  were  the  jury  speaker's  answers,  given  in  open  court,  to  the  trial  judge's 
direct  questions  about  whether  allowing  a  majority  verdict  might  resolve  the 
situation  and  whether  the  jury  wanted  more  time  to  consider  its  verdict.    The 
appeal should be dismissed. 

The facts 

The appellant's trial began on Tuesday, 18 February 2014.  There was no 
 
dispute  that  the  appellant  had  sexual  intercourse  with  the  complainant.    The 
issues  for  the  jury  were  whether  that  intercourse  was  by  consent  and,  if  not, 
whether  the  appellant  had  an  honest  and  reasonable,  but  mistaken,  belief  as  to 
consent. 

 
The jury retired to consider its verdict at 11.14 am on Friday, 21 February 
2014.    No  direction  was  given  to  the  jury  concerning  any  prohibition  or 
restriction  upon  the  disclosure  of  jury  deliberations  to  the  court.    The  jury  was 
told: 

""If you need any further directions on the law, again, all you need to do is 
ask.  I ask if you have any requests that you reduce them to writing so that 
they can be considered before you are brought back in the court room.""   

9 

At  3.09  pm  that  day,  the  jury  was  permitted  to  disperse  and  return  the 

 
following Monday to resume deliberations.  The trial judge said, in part: 

""You shouldn't talk to anyone at all about the case or any of the decisions 
you've got to make or any thoughts you've got about the case, and that also 
includes  any  one  of  your  number,  at  this  stage.    You  should  only 
deliberate  when  all  12  of  you  are  together,  so,  when  I  allow  you  to 
separate  now  and  go  home,  you  can't  even  talk  about  it  between 
yourselves,  all  right?    So  simply  put  the  case  aside.    Obviously,  you  can 
think about it over the weekend, but you shouldn't discuss it with anyone 
else.""

On Monday, 24 February 2014, the jury resumed deliberations.  The jury 
sent the trial judge a note.  The jury sought further direction on the term ""beyond 
reasonable doubt"", the reading of part of a witness' statement and a definition of 
""consent"".  Following  consultation with counsel, the trial judge dealt with those 
matters at 12.31 pm. 

 
At 2.31 pm that day, the trial judge read to counsel a further note sent to 
him by the jury.  The note read ""[t]his jury cannot reach a consensus of opinion.  
Please advise.""  At 2.33 pm, the jury  was given a  Black1 direction and asked to 
consider the matter anew.   

At 4.20 pm, the trial judge told counsel that the jury had sent him a third 

 
note.  The third note read: 

""To His Honour, 

The jury is still not in total agreeance. 

- First formal vote was  

[redacted] for [redacted] against  

(Guilty) 

- Second formal vote was 

[redacted] for [redacted] against 

Thank you."" 

 
The trial judge informed counsel that the note read ""[t]he jury is still not in 
total  agreement.""    The  trial  judge  told  counsel  that  the  note  disclosed  the  jury's 
voting patterns, which  he did not intend to publish further.  The trial judge also 
stated that the jury had been deliberating for more than eight hours.  Counsel did 
not  disagree  with  that  calculation  or  disagree  with  the  trial  judge's  declaration 
that he did not intend to disclose the jury's voting patterns.   

 
To  understand  why  it  is  relevant  that  the  jury  had  deliberated  for  more 
than eight hours and what the trial judge next told counsel, it is necessary to refer 
to  some  provisions  of  the  Jury  Act  1995  (Q)  (""the  Jury  Act""),  which  governs 
juries in Queensland.

For certain criminal trials, s 59A(2) of the Jury Act permits a trial judge to 
ask a jury to reach a ""majority verdict"" if, after the ""prescribed period"", the judge 
is  satisfied  that  the  jury  is  unlikely  to  reach  a  unanimous  verdict  after  further 
deliberation.  A ""majority verdict"", if the jury consists of 12 jurors, is a verdict on 
which  at  least  11  jurors  agree2.    ""Prescribed  period""  is  defined  in  s 59A(6)  to 
mean: 

""(a) 

a  period  of  at  least  8  hours  after  the  jury  retires  to  consider  its 
verdict, not including any of the following periods –  

(i) 

a period allowed for meals or refreshments; 

(ii) 

a period during which the judge allows the jury to separate, 
or an individual juror to separate from the jury; 

(iii) 

a  period  provided  for  the  purpose  of  the  jury  being 
accommodated overnight; or 

(b) 

the  further  period  the  judge  considers  reasonable  having  regard  to 
the complexity of the trial."" 

16 

 
After  discussing  the  calculation  of  the  eight  hours,  the  trial  judge  told 
counsel  of  his  intention  to  question  the  jury  members  on  whether  they  could 
reach a majority verdict:   

""[I]t's open to give them the majority verdict direction.  What I propose to 
do  is  to  ask  them  whether  an  11:1  vote  would  resolve  the  issue  and  see 
what  their  answer  is  to  that.    It  may  be  that  it  won't.    This  is  the  second 
note I've got that they're deadlocked.  …  What I intend to do is tell them 
that there's a majority verdict option open to them now, that it is 11:1 and 
will that resolve the situation."" 

17 

18 

 

 

Neither counsel made an application for the jury to be discharged.   

The jury returned at 4.25 pm.  The trial judge said: 

""Ladies  and  gentlemen,  because  a  certain  period  of  time  has  passed 
without  your  ability  to  reach  a  unanimous  verdict,  the  law  now  allows  a 
majority verdict to be taken in a case like this.  The majority, however, is 
11:1.  So I need to know, I suppose, from you whether that might resolve 
the situation and whether you want further time to consider, because now I 
can take a verdict of 11 of you.  It must be an agreed verdict between 11 
of you.  That's the extent of the majority verdict I can take.""

After identifying the jury speaker, the trial judge then said: 

8. 

""Do you want more time to consider that, or – I've got the contents of your 
note.    I  haven't  disclosed  it,  because  really  your  voting  is  a  matter  for 
yourself.  So the parties aren't aware of your voting, but if you want some 
more time, then you can have it, certainly."" 

20 

21 

22 

The  jury  speaker  responded  saying  ""[y]ou  could  probably  give  us  about 

 
half an hour and we can [indistinct]."" 

 
The trial judge asked the jury to retire again.  He reminded the jury that a 
majority  verdict  had  to  be  an  11:1  verdict  and  that  that  required  agreement 
between 11 of them. 

 
The jury retired at 4.26 pm.  The third note was placed in an envelope and 
sealed.    The  jury  returned  at  4.44  pm.    The  jury  convicted  the  appellant  by  a 
majority of 11:1.   

The Jury Act – other relevant provisions 

23 

Section 70 of the Jury Act, entitled ""Confidentiality of jury deliberations"", 
 
provides that a person must not publish to the public ""jury information"":  s 70(2).   

24 

 

""Jury information"" is defined in s 70(17) to mean: 

""(a) 

information about statements made, opinions expressed, arguments 
advanced, or votes cast, in the course of a jury's deliberations; or 

(b) 

information  identifying  or  likely  to  identify  a  person  as,  or  as 
having been, a juror in a particular proceeding.""  (emphasis added) 

25 

26 

27 

Section 70(3) prohibits a person from seeking from a juror or former juror 
 
the disclosure of jury information.  Section 70(4) prohibits a juror or former juror 
from disclosing jury information if the juror or former juror has reason to believe 
any of the information is likely to be, or will be, published to the public. 

Sub-sections (2)-(4) of s 70 are subject to sub-ss (6)-(17)3.  Section 70(6) 
 
is important.  It provides that ""[i]nformation may be sought by, and disclosed to, 
the  court  to  the  extent  necessary  for  the  proper  performance  of  the  jury's 
functions."" 

 
Section  50  requires  members  of  the  jury  to  ""be  sworn  to  give  a  true 
verdict,  according  to  the  evidence,  on  the  issues  to  be  tried,  and  not to disclose

anything  about  the  jury's  deliberations  except  as  allowed  or  required  by  law"" 
(emphasis added).  Section 70(6) is such a law.   

9. 

 
Section  60(1)  provides  that  ""[i]f  a  jury  can  not  agree  on  a  verdict,  or  the 
judge  considers  there  are  other  proper  reasons  for  discharging  the  jury  without 
giving  a  verdict,  the  judge  may  discharge  the  jury  without  giving  a  verdict.""  
A decision of a judge under s 60 is not subject to appeal4. 

The Court of Appeal 

 
The  appellant  appealed  to  the  Court  of  Appeal  of  the  Supreme  Court  of 
Queensland against his conviction.  He alleged, among other things, that the trial 
judge  should  have  disclosed  the  precise  contents  of  the  third  note from  the  jury 
(including what that note said about interim votes and interim voting patterns of 
the jury).   

The  Court  of  Appeal  (Holmes  JA,  Philippides  and  Dalton  JJ)5  relevantly 
 
concluded  that  (1)  the  information  about  interim  votes  and  interim  voting 
patterns  in  the  jury's  third  note  was  neither  relevant  nor  capable  of  influencing 
the trial judge's exercise of discretion to permit a majority verdict6; (2) there was 
no  denial  of  procedural  fairness  to  the  appellant  when  the  trial  judge  did  not 
disclose to counsel the interim votes and interim voting patterns recorded in the 
third  note  before  exercising  the  discretion  to  ask  the  jury  to  reach  a  majority 
verdict7; and (3) there was no need for the trial judge to discharge the jury simply 
because  he  did  not  propose  to  disclose  the  interim  votes  and  interim  voting 
patterns recorded in the third note8.

In  reaching  those  conclusions,  the  Court  of  Appeal  declined9  to  follow  a 
 
unanimous decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal in LLW v The Queen10 and 
a majority decision of that Court in HM v The Queen11.   

Jury votes or voting patterns should not be disclosed 

Jury deliberations should, so far as possible, remain confidential12.  That is 
 
a  principle  of  the  highest  significance  in  the  criminal  justice  system13.    When 
conveying  to  a  trial  judge  that  they  are  having  difficulty  in  reaching  a  verdict, 
juries  should  not  reveal  their  votes  or  voting  patterns14
.    It  would  be  a  sensible 
measure  for  trial  judges  to  give  a  direction  to  juries  that  they  should  not 
communicate  or  reveal  to  the  court  their  votes  or  voting  patterns  in  favour  of 
conviction or acquittal, to lessen the risk of any  such disclosure before delivery 
of a verdict15
.  And in that connection a trial judge should not inquire of a jury as 
to its votes or voting patterns16. 

 
The  purpose  of  the  confidentiality  of  jury  votes  or  voting  patterns  is 
twofold.    First,  it  maintains  confidence  in  the  jury  system.    It  enables  jurors  to 
approach their task through frank and open discussion knowing that what is said 
in the jury room remains in that room17

contributes to the development, over time, of the individual and collective views

The  fluidity  arises  because  the  process  is  a  human  endeavour.    The 
development of each juror's assessment and understanding of the questions to be 
answered is necessarily  unique.  It does not happen at the same time and in the 
same manner.  The fluidity in the process also arises because of the nature of the 
jury's task.  A jury is usually required to consider not only the ultimate question 
of  whether  guilt  has  been  established  beyond  reasonable  doubt,  but  also 
particular questions that are steps along the way to the final conclusion reflected 
in a verdict, or the inability to reach a verdict.  As a juror's understanding of one 
question changes, so might their understanding of others.  Indeed, until the final 
verdict, each juror is entitled to change their mind18 and they do19. 

 
The second purpose of the confidentiality of jury votes or voting patterns, 
directly related to the first purpose, is that it protects the finality of the verdict20.  
The process by which the jury reached its verdict is not relevant21.  It is the final 
verdict of the jury, or the inability of the jury to reach a verdict, that is relevant.   

 
In  the  present  appeal,  the  appellant  submitted  that  he  was  denied  a  fair 
trial in accordance with law because procedural fairness required that the interim 
votes  and  interim  voting  patterns  of  the  jury  set  out  in  the  third  jury  note  be 
disclosed to counsel and this was not done.   

 
The balance of these reasons will consider the appellant's entitlement to a 
fair trial in accordance with law and then explain why the non-disclosure of the 
interim votes and interim voting patterns of the jury did not give rise to a denial 
of procedural fairness. 

Accused entitled to a fair trial in accordance with law

""rules  of  law  and  of  practice  designed  to  regulate  the  course  of  the  trial""23.    As 
stated by Mason CJ and McHugh J in Dietrich v The Queen24:  

12. 

 
""There  has  been  no  judicial  attempt  to  list  exhaustively  the 
attributes  of  a  fair  trial.    That  is  because,  in  the  ordinary  course  of  the 
criminal  appellate  process,  an  appellate  court  is  generally  called  upon  to 
determine, as here, whether something that was done or said in the course 
of  the  trial,  or  less  usually  before  trial,  resulted  in  the  accused  being 
deprived  of  a  fair  trial  and  led  to  a  miscarriage  of  justice.""    (footnote 
omitted) 

One  of  the  requirements  of  a  fair  trial  is  that  the  accused  be  accorded 

 
procedural fairness.   

In  R  v  Wise25  Ormiston  JA  (with  whom  Brooking  and  Chernov JJA 

 
agreed) explained one part of procedural fairness in these terms: 

""It  is  an  elementary  rule,  whether  in  relation  to  civil  or  criminal 
proceedings,  that  a  judge  shall  not  determine  any  question  without 
affording counsel for each party an opportunity to see and comment upon 
any  material  relevant  to  the  issue  before  the  court  which  is  available  to 
the judge and known not to be available to counsel"".  (emphasis added) 

 
There  are  two  related  aspects  of  this  rule.    First,  information  relevant  to 
issues  before  the  court  which  is  available  to  the  judge  and  known  not  to  be 
available to counsel must be disclosed to counsel.  The second aspect is that the 
accused  and  the  prosecution  must  be  afforded  an  opportunity  to  make 
submissions which bear upon questions about the future conduct of the trial.  For 
these reasons, as Chernov JA rightly said in Ucar v Nylex Industrial Products Pty 
Ltd26: 

""[T]he  general  rule  [is]  that  a  party  should  be  given  the  opportunity  to 
respond  to  matters  prejudicial  to  its  interests  that  are  known  only  to  the

Bunning  v  Cross  (1978)  141  CLR  54;  [1978]  HCA  22,  R  v  Sang  [1980]  AC  402 
and Jago v District Court (NSW) (1989) 168 CLR 23 at 29; [1989] HCA 46. 

24   (1992) 177 CLR 292 at 300. 

25   (2000) 2 VR 287 at 294 [20]. 

26   (2007)  17  VR  492  at  503  [27].    The  general  rule  might  be  affected  by  specific 
legislative  provisions:    see,  eg,  Condon  v  Pompano  Pty  Ltd  (2013)  252  CLR  38; 
[2013] HCA 7.

court and which might be taken into account in the determination of issues 
that may affect the party's property, rights or legitimate expectations."" 

It follows that if information  made available to a judge is  not relevant to 
 
an  issue  before  the  court,  nor  regarded  by  the  judge  as  relevant,  then  its  non-
disclosure to counsel cannot be a denial of procedural fairness.   

Issue and analysis 

At  least  until  the  jury  withdrew  to  consider  its  verdict,  there  is  no 
 
suggestion  that  the  appellant's  trial  was  other  than  according  to  law.    Did  the 
appellant have a fair trial according to law after the point at which the jury retired 
to consider its verdict?   

 
In particular,  did the appellant have  a fair trial according to law after the 
trial judge received the third note from the jury (which set out interim votes and 
interim  voting  patterns  of  the  jury)  but  decided  not  to  disclose  the  precise 
contents of that note to counsel?  The answer is yes.   

 
Or to put the same question another way, when the trial judge received the 
third note from the jury, was the trial judge obliged, before determining whether 
to permit a majority verdict or to discharge the jury27, to disclose to counsel the 
precise contents of that note?  The answer to that question is no.   

 

Why must the questions be answered this way? 

 
First, the general principle that interim votes and interim voting patterns of 
a jury should not be disclosed was not displaced by the Jury Act.  Neither party 
submitted to the contrary.  The Jury Act contains a number of express restrictions 
on the disclosure of jury deliberations and ""jury information"".  Each juror swears 
an  oath  or  affirmation  ""not  to  disclose  anything  about  the  jury's  deliberations 
except  as  allowed  or  required  by  law.""28    Section  70(2)  prohibits  publication  of 
""jury information"" to the public.  ""Jury information"" includes information about 
the votes cast in the course of a jury's deliberations29.  And it is an offence for a 

                                                                                                                                     
27   Section 60(1) of the Jury Act provides the judge with a discretion to discharge the 
jury.    That  discretion  is  not  subject  to  any  temporal  limitation.    Therefore,  if  the 
prescribed period in s 59A has elapsed, the judge could consider a majority verdict 
or discharge of the jury:  cf R v Smith [2014] QCA 277 at [62].

juror  to  disclose  jury  information  if  the  juror  has  reason  to  believe  any  of  the 
information is likely to be, or will be, published to the public30.   

14. 

 
Section  70(6)  provides  that  ""[i]nformation  may  be  sought  by,  and 
disclosed to, the court  to the extent necessary for the proper performance of the 
jury's functions"" (emphasis added).  Disclosure to the court of interim votes and 
interim voting patterns of the jury is not necessary for the proper performance of 
the jury's functions.  Disclosure is not necessary to enable the jury to perform its 
role  of  determining  whether  the  prosecution  has  established  the  guilt  of  the 
accused beyond reasonable doubt.   

Disclosure is not necessary to enable a judge to reach a view on whether 
 
to ask the jury to consider a majority verdict under s 59A(2) or to discharge the 
jury  under  s 60(1).    Neither  s 59A(2)  nor  s 60(1)  contemplates  disclosure  of  the 
interim  votes  or  interim  voting  patterns  of  the  jury  to  the  trial  judge  in  the 
exercise of the discretion.  The Jury Act seeks to maintain the confidentiality of a 
jury's  interim  votes  and  interim  voting  patterns,  notwithstanding  the  availability 
of the judicial discretions that exist in ss 59A(2) and 60(1). 

 
Second, the general principle that a jury's interim votes or interim  voting 
patterns are not to be disclosed was not displaced by the accused's right to a fair 
trial in accordance with law31, ensured and informed by principles of procedural 
fairness.   

 
In considering procedural fairness in this appeal, the question to be asked 
and answered is whether the material – here, information about interim votes and 
interim voting patterns of the jury at a time prior to verdict  which was available 
to the trial judge and known not to be available to counsel – was relevant to an 
issue before the court.   

That information was  not  made relevant by  the Jury  Act32.  And because 
 
of  the  protean  and  changeable  character  of  the  jury's  deliberations,  it  was  not 
otherwise  relevant.    As  this  Court  said  in  Black  v  The  Queen33,  it  is  ""proper  to 
remind  the  jurors  that  they  should  listen  to  each  other's  views,  weigh  them 
objectively  and  that  an  individual  juror  can  change  his  or  her  mind  if  honestly 
persuaded  that  his  or  her  preliminary  view  is  not  well  founded.""    Precisely 
because a jury's votes can and do change, a statement of what a jury's votes were 

                                                                                                                                     
30   Jury Act, s 70(4).

at a time prior to verdict is not relevant.  It is a statement which adds nothing to 
the  knowledge  that  the  jury  is  deadlocked  or  has  not  yet  reached  a  verdict.  
Indeed, as Philippides J said in the Court of Appeal below34: 

""[O]ne  may  question  the  extent  to  which  the  precise  voting  figures  may 
provide  a  useful  basis  for  submissions.    Individual  jurors  do  not 
necessarily  reach  a  particular  conclusion  by  the  same  route  and  thus  the 
jury  figures  may  present  a  misleading  picture  of  the  extent  and  nature  of 
the division  of the jury.  They  may not reflect the true complexity of the 
jury's  reasoning  and  lead  to  a  type  of  second-guessing  of  the  jury's 
deliberations."" 

 
After  the  delivery  of  the  third  note,  what  was  relevant  were  the  jury 
speaker's responses to the trial judge's questions, asked in open court and set out 
at [18]-[20] above, about whether allowing  a  majority  verdict  might resolve the 
situation  and  whether  the  jury  wanted  more  time  to  consider  its  verdict.    The 
length and complexity of the trial, as well as the time the jury had already spent 
deliberating,  were  also  relevant  considerations.    Information  as  to  interim  votes 
or interim voting patterns of the jury prior to verdict was not relevant.  Counsel 
were  therefore  not  denied  any  opportunity  to  make  any  submission  about  any 
relevant matter.   

Capacity of voting patterns to influence a trial judge 

 
The  appellant  submitted  that  the  information  about  interim  votes  or 
interim  voting  patterns  of  the  jury  at  a  time  prior  to  verdict  had  a  capacity  to 
influence the trial judge's exercise of discretion to either allow a majority verdict 
or  to  discharge  the  jury.    That  submission  should  be  rejected.    The  trial  judge 
knew that the jury was deadlocked.  When the trial judge asked the jury whether 
allowing  a  majority  verdict  might  resolve  the  situation  and  whether  the  jury 
wanted  more  time  to  consider  its  verdict,  the  trial  judge  did  not  know  what  the 
result was going to be.  At that point in time, the conduct of the trial judge and 
counsel  was  dependent  on the  jury  speaker's  response  to  those  questions  and  to 
the  other  jurors'  reactions  to  the  jury  speaker's  responses.    It  was  not  dependent 
on, or affected by, what had been disclosed in the third note.   

 
Moreover, in this appeal, information as to interim votes or interim voting 
patterns of the jury prior to verdict – information which, as has been explained, 
was not relevant to the exercise of the discretion – was not taken into account by 
the trial judge.  The trial judge told the jury that he had not disclosed the precise 
contents of the note containing that information, ""because really your voting is a 
matter for yourself.""  From this statement it should be inferred that the trial judge

rightly  disregarded  the  information  that  the  jury  had  given  as  to  its  votes  or 
voting patterns prior to verdict.  There was no denial of procedural fairness. 

16. 

Extent of numerical split 

 
The redactions to the third jury note mean that the extent of the numerical 
split  disclosed  to  the  trial  judge  is  not  known.    However,  the  extent  of  the 
numerical  split  disclosed  does  not  and  cannot  alter  these  conclusions.    Even  if 
disclosure  of  interim  votes  or  interim  voting  patterns  of  a  jury  prior  to  verdict 
indicated that, at some point in its deliberations, the jury was split 11:1, that fact 
(and its disclosure) would not be relevant to and would not have the capacity to 
influence any decision the judge has to make about the future conduct of the trial.  
Without much further and more detailed information about the state of the jury's 
deliberations (which it is impermissible to seek), the note tells the judge no more 
than  that,  at  some  point  in  its  deliberations,  the  jury  was  not  in  unanimous 
agreement.    It  says  nothing  about  the  question  of  whether  further  deliberation 
might  lead  to  a  verdict  that  can  be  taken.    To  the  extent  that  decisions  of 
intermediate  courts35  suggest  that  a  trial  judge  is  required  to  disclose  interim 
voting  patterns  in  the  event  of  an  11:1  split,  those  decisions  are  incorrect  and 
should not be followed. 

Other matters 

In LLW v The Queen36 and a majority decision in HM v The Queen37, the 
 
Victorian Court of Appeal reached conclusions contrary to that reached in these 
reasons.    The  Court  of  Appeal's  conclusions  did  not  depend  upon  any  relevant 
difference  between  the  applicable  legislative  provisions.    It  follows  from  what 
has  been  said  earlier  that  the  decision  in  LLW  v  The  Queen  and  the  majority 
decision in HM v The Queen should not be followed.   

 
None  of  the  preceding  analysis  should  be  understood  as  detracting  from 
the proposition that a trial judge must disclose to counsel the precise terms of any 
questions  asked  by  a  jury38.    The  precise  questions  asked  by  a  jury  will  be 
material  relevant  to  an  issue  before  the  court,  and  the  accused  and  the 
prosecution should be afforded an opportunity to make submissions on any issues 
raised by those questions.

The questions from the jury in this appeal demonstrate the point.  The jury 
asked  the  trial  judge  questions  concerning  the  term  ""beyond  reasonable  doubt"" 
and  access  to  part  of  the  evidence,  and  a  further  question  of  law39.    Those 
questions  were  material  relevant  to  an  issue  before  the  court.    Some  questions 
from  a  jury  are  directed  at  the  ultimate  question  of  whether  guilt  has  been 
established  beyond  reasonable  doubt,  the  final  conclusion  being  reflected  in  a 
verdict or the inability to reach a verdict.  Other questions from a jury are steps 
along  the  way  to  that  final  conclusion.    It  is  for  those  reasons  that  the  precise 
questions  are  disclosed  and  the  accused  and  the  prosecution  are  afforded  an 
opportunity to make submissions. 

Conclusion and orders 

The  failure  of  the  trial  judge  to  inform  counsel  of  the  interim  votes  and 
 
interim  voting  patterns  of  the  jury  did  not  constitute  a  denial  of  procedural 
fairness.    The  central  question  to  be  answered  in  reaching  that  conclusion  was 
whether the material – the information about the interim votes and interim voting 
patterns  of  the  jury  –  was  relevant  to  an  issue  before  the  court.    Neither  the 
interim votes of the jury nor the interim voting patterns of the jury were relevant 
to any issue before the court or regarded as such by the trial judge.  The appeal 
should be dismissed.

Certain features of this case have caused us some anxiety, but we are of opinion that it would not be in accordance with the principles governing the exercise of our jurisdiction to give special leave to appeal after a conviction upon indictment to grant this application.
               
Stuart, the applicant, was convicted of murder after a trial in Adelaide before the Supreme Court of South Australia, and was sentenced to death. He appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal of South Australia against his conviction, but his appeal was dismissed. From that decision dismissing his appeal he now seeks special leave to appeal to this Court.
               
The crime of which the prisoner has been found guilty was committed at Thevenard near Ceduna on Saturday, 20th December 1958. On that afternoon a girl aged nine years who had been playing on the beach was raped and murdered in a cave by the seashore. Her body was found there on that night by those searching for her. It is unnecessary for us to say anything of the horrifying details of the crime; it is enough to state that there was nothing to be seen which would identify the guilty man, unless it be some footprints which next morning were traced by black trackers from the cave to a pool of water and thence back and to a roadway above.
               
The applicant is an aboriginal of the Arunta tribe, not quite of the full blood, aged about twenty-seven years. He had come to Ceduna on the previous day with a travelling show by which he was employed. On Monday 22nd December, that is two days after the commission of the crime, at about ten o'clock at night a party of six officers of police went to the place where by that time the prisoner was quartered and took him to the police station. There he was questioned for some time. According to the evidence of the police officers, at first he denied all implication in the crime and then, by steps which it is needless to trace, came to admit it and described the circumstances. A confession was typed out, and this he signed in block letters. He was charged with murder and locked up. Next morning in the cells, so the evidence of the police officers stated, he made further admissions of guilt when they showed him certain things found in the cave and questioned him about them. He was warned, they said, that he need not answer and that his answers would be given in evidence. The confessional statements of the previous night and these admissions formed the substance of the case against the prisoner. All that was added to connect him with the crime was an opinion expressed by the black trackers that the footprints on the beach were his. There was of course much evidence besides, and none of it was inconsistent with his guilt, but it was not evidence which implicated him as the author of the crime.
               
The prisoner applied to the Law Society for legal aid and upon his trial was represented by counsel. He was arraigned before Reed J. and pleaded not guilty. It was not then suggested, nor does it appear to have been suggested by anybody at any stage, that he needed an interpreter, and, of course, the evidence of the officers of police as to the confessional statements must have appeared in the depositions, and it necessarily implied a sufficient mastery of spoken English. Now, however, there is filed in this Court in support of the application an affidavit sworn by a deponent, Mr. T. G. H. Strehlow, who apparently is not without authority in such matters, stating that the Arunta language is the only tongue in which the prisoner has any ""complete fluency of expression"", and that he is considerably handicapped when confined to the English language, his knowledge of which is ""inadequate"", and that the confession ""could not have been dictated by a totally illiterate aboriginal"". Counsel for the applicant did not think fit to raise any question of his understanding of English at the proper time, which was, of course, on the arraignment, and neither Mr. Strehlow's affidavit nor any evidence to a similar effect was put before the Court of Criminal Appeal. Generally speaking, this Court is confined on appeal to the material which was before the court appealed from: see e.g. Victorian Stevedoring and General Contracting Co. Pty. Ltd. v. Dignan
                  
    [1]
  . But in any case it is entirely consistent with this affidavit that the applicant was fully capable of understanding and answering questions put to him and of describing intelligibly simple acts and events. It is to be observed that the objection to the police evidence appears to have been based throughout on alleged extortion by violence and threats rather than on any inability of the applicant to understand questions put to him. Having regard to all the circumstances, we do not think that a ground for granting special leave is disclosed by Mr. Strehlow's affidavit.



                         (1931) 46 C.L.R. 73, at pp. 109, 110.


               
The next ground of the application relates also to the confession evidence, and arises in this way. At the commencement of the trial counsel for the applicant, knowing or believing that the crown prosecutor proposed to open to the jury the substance of the alleged admissions and confession, asked the learned trial judge to rule that these matters should not be opened. Where a serious question of admissibility of evidence is raised by the defence at this stage of a criminal trial, it is a usual course for the matter to be dealt with then and there on voir dire in the absence of the jury. But we are told that, when the application for the ruling was made, counsel for the Crown informed the court that upon consideration of the evidence taken at the preliminary inquiry he could see no reason why he should not open the whole case to the jury. At the same time, it is said, he also informed the presiding judge that, if the defence undertook, when the evidence came to be tendered, to call evidence to substantiate the allegations of violence and threats which had been suggested to the police witnesses during their cross-examination at that inquiry, he would refrain from pursuing this course. Counsel for the applicant declined to give any such undertaking, and his Honour declined to give the ruling sought. Thereupon, counsel for the Crown, believing that there was no sufficient reason why he should not open fully to the jury, proceeded to do so.
               
Obviously if, thereafter, the evidence had been rejected, it would have been a clear case for the discharge of the jury. But, when the evidence came to be tendered, no objection was then taken to it. Nor, in spite of what had occurred at the commencement of the trial, was any reference made by either counsel or by the learned trial judge to the question whether there should be an examination upon the voir dire in order to determine whether the evidence should be submitted to the jury. Counsel for the applicant informed us upon the present application that he did not then object because he considered that the reference to the admissions and confession which had already been made would inevitably prejudice his client upon any future trial and, apparently, he preferred to rest upon his original objection, which is now made a ground of this application for special leave to appeal.
               
The substance of the objection now made lies in the fact that the crown prosecutor opened to the jury evidence the admissibility of which counsel for the applicant wished to challenge. But the learned trial judge had a discretion in the matter, and we do not think it can be maintained that it was wrongly exercised. It does not even appear that an application was made that the admissibility of the evidence should be decided then and there on voir dire. The matter seems to have been put merely as one of propriety. The crown prosecutor had intimated that he would not seek to open the evidence if counsel for the applicant undertook to object at the proper time and call evidence to substantiate the suggestions made in cross-examination at the preliminary inquiry. When such an undertaking was refused, we can see nothing unreasonable in the course which the learned judge took. It is true that, the question of admissibility being raised, the burden lay on the Crown of proving that the statement was voluntary, and it was open to counsel for the applicant to rely simply on cross-examination without calling his client. It is true also that, if his client were called, he would be subject to cross-examination. But that would have been in the absence of the jury. When counsel for the applicant declined the invitation of the crown prosecutor, it is impossible to say that the ruling of the learned judge involved any such erroneous exercise of discretion as could justify this Court in granting special leave to appeal. The effect of his Honour's initial ruling and of counsel's omission to take objection at the proper time was not, of course, to conclude the question of voluntariness. The case which the applicant sought to make on the confession and admissions was put clearly and emphatically to the jury in the judge's charge, although not a great deal of cross-examination had in fact been directed to it. They were told first that the Crown case was that they ""should act upon the confession as having been obtained properly without any violence, or threat of violence, without any promise or inducement being held out and without the police taking any improper advantage of their position"". Later in the charge his Honour discussed the evidence on the subject, though perhaps not very favourably to the prisoner. Having done so, he gave this direction: ""This, gentlemen, is a most important question for you to consider, and I will say at once, that unless you are satisfied beyond any reasonable doubt that the evidence, the questions and the answers, the answers obtained as a result of the questions, and the defendant's statement, were obtained without any threat of violence, without any violence, without any promise or inducement, without any conduct on the part of the police which was an unfair taking advantage of their position, well gentlemen, then you will no doubt reject the confession, and the evidence of the answers, which are very much to the same effect.""
               
               
But before the summing up was reached a situation arose at the trial out of which arises another ground on which the present application is based. It appears that in South Australia a prisoner's right to make a statement from the dock may be exercised by his reading a written statement prepared in advance. Had he been able to read such a statement, that is the course which the prisoner's counsel would have desired him to take. Upon instructions, a statement had in fact been prepared on his behalf, but of course he could not read it. A request was therefore made by his counsel that it be read for him by an officer of the court. To this course the Crown objected and the objection was upheld as one upon which the Crown was entitled to insist. His Honour said, however, that counsel might prompt the applicant in the making of a statement. A short adjournment was then given for the purpose of his counsel consulting with the prisoner. After the adjournment counsel said:— ""The defendant will make a statement. I do not know that I can assist him in any way with his statement."" The transcript record of the trial proceeds:—""His Honour:—""I said formerly that you would be allowed to prompt the defendant on any topic, and ask him things and assist him as far as possible, in order to allow him to make his statement. In other words, assist him to cover everything that he desires to put to the jury. I do not wish any misunderstanding about that. Now how do you wish the statement to be given?"" Mr. O'Sullivan:—""I want him to stand up and say what he wishes to say, and I am prepared to leave it at that""."" In the ultimate result, the prisoner's statement consisted of what may be described as a few, and relatively inarticulate, words which denied his guilt and alleged ill-treatment on the part of the police officers who had interrogated him. It was as follows:—""I cannot read or write. Never been to school. I did not see the little girl. I did not kill her. Police hit me. Choke me. Make me said these words. They say I kill her. That is what I want to say."" (His counsel then spoke to him.) ""That is what I want to say. Someone to read this out for me.""
               
               
We agree with the Full Court that the applicant had no legal right to have his prepared statement read for him. At the same time, it could, of course, have been done with the consent of the Crown, and, in the special circumstances of this case, one might perhaps have expected consent to be given. What the statement contained we do not know: the prisoner's counsel refused to have it marked for identification. But the case against the applicant rested almost entirely on the ""confessional"" evidence, and his case as to that had been made sufficiently clear by the cross-examination. It may well be thought that the course which the learned judge was prepared to allow his counsel to follow, and which he declined to follow, was a course more favourable to the applicant than that which his counsel wished to adopt. It came very near to allowing him to examine the applicant in chief without having him sworn or cross-examined. In any case no legal right of the applicant was denied. The Court of Criminal Appeal has held that no miscarriage of justice occurred by reason of what took place, and we do not think that any ground which would justify the intervention of this Court can be found therein.
               
There is yet another matter. In addressing the jury at the conclusion of the evidence counsel for the Crown was at some pains to inform them that the prisoner had not been denied an opportunity of putting his version of the facts before them for their consideration. There is some doubt as to the precise manner in which this was done, but it sufficiently appears that he told the jury that they should not be misled by what had taken place into thinking that the applicant suffered any injustice. He then pointed out to them that upon his trial the applicant had the right to make an unsworn statement or, alternatively, to give evidence from the witness box and to be asked questions. The doubt as to what the learned counsel exactly said exists because there is neither a shorthand note nor complete agreement as to what was said. The versions are to be seen in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal. On either version, the jury was in effect told by counsel that the applicant had a right to give evidence on oath and subject to cross-examination. And any such statement is capable of being understood as inviting the jury to take into account against the accused the fact that he is apparently unwilling to exercise that right. In these circumstances, it was said, the observations in question amounted to a contravention of s. 18 II of the Evidence Act 1929-1933 which provides that ""the failure of any person charged with an offence  to give evidence shall not be made the subject of any comment by the prosecution"". Counsel for the Crown contended that there had been no such contravention, substantially because there had been no express allusion to the ""failure"" of the prisoner to give evidence. It was the right to give evidence, not the failure to exercise it, that was the subject of comment. He relied upon the decision of this Court in Bataillard v. The King
                  
    [1]
  . But in our view the opinions expressed in that case do not support his contention. The comment in that case was to the effect that the statement of the accused was a statement which was not on oath and not subject to cross-examination, and, while the members of the Court were not prepared to give special leave to appeal from the decision of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, which had held that the comment did not infringe the statutory provision which was in force in that State, they left no doubt that, if the comment had been accompanied by any circumstance calculated to inform or remind the jury of the fact that the accused person had the right to give evidence on oath and yet failed to do so, they would have regarded it as a contravention. What was said by counsel for the Crown in the present case was in our opinion (whichever of the two versions be accepted) such a comment as is forbidden by the statute. In this respect we are unable to agree with the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal.



                         (1907) 4 C.L.R. 1282.


               
The statute gives an important protection to accused persons, and the prohibition which it conveys is peremptory. Prima facie a breach by the prosecution of that prohibition must provide a good ground for the quashing by a court of criminal appeal of a conviction. If it were not so, the statutory prohibition would be without sanction. In the present case, however, there are two considerations which, in combination, would, we think, have justified the Court of Criminal Appeal, even if it had taken the view of counsel's observations which we think correct, in declining to quash the conviction. In the first place, those observations, although we think that they amounted to a comment of the character forbidden by the statute, were—whichever version be accepted—made alio intuitu: the immediate occasion for them is to be found in the altogether exceptional circumstances attending the making of his statement by the applicant. Primarily at least, they were made by way of answer to any suggestion that the accused had not had a fair opportunity of putting his case. A second relevant consideration in this case is that the prohibition contained in s. 18 II of the Evidence Act is directed to ""the prosecution"" and does not exclude the right of the judge to comment. In fact, in his summing-up, the learned trial judge covered the same ground and informed the jury of the courses which were open to the accused. His comment was clear and emphatic. The effect upon the jury of his Honour's comment, which of course was entirely lawful and appears to have been made independently of the comment of the prosecutor, must have reduced the learned counsel's irregular comment to insignificance.
               
It would, we think, having regard to these circumstances, be taking an unrealistic view if we were to treat the comment by counsel as a ground warranting the exercise of our jurisdiction to grant special leave to appeal. It is not, of course, to be supposed that in every case a lawful comment by the trial judge on a failure to give evidence can have the practical effect of erasing or condoning a prior unlawful comment by the prosecution. The latter can in no sense be treated as merged in the former. In any ordinary case the lawful and the unlawful comment must be presumed to have been cumulative in effect, and the appropriate consequences must be visited upon the latter. The circumstances of the present case are altogether exceptional.
               
As we have said, this case has caused us a good deal of anxiety, but, after full consideration, we are of opinion that no sufficient ground has been shown for granting special leave to appeal. We think we should add that while these reasons were in preparation a communication was made on behalf of the Crown to the Principal Registrar of material said to bear on the prisoner's capacity to understand English. This communication we have entirely ignored and we do not think it ought to have been made.",1959-06-19 00:00:00,High Court of Australia

The following written judgments were delivered:—



               Dec. 13
               Mason C.J. and McHugh J.
               
This application for special leave to appeal raises, if only indirectly, a question of some difficulty concerning the approach to be applied by the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal when, having quashed sentences imposed by the sentencing judge before the commencement of the Sentencing Act 1989 
                  N.S.W. (""the Act""), it is required to resentence the convicted person after the commencement of the Act. In order to explain the nature of the question, we need to refer to the important changes in sentencing procedures which the Act has introduced.
               
                  
The new sentencing procedures introduced by the Act
                  
Section 3(a) of the Act recites that one of its objects is:to promote truth in sentencing by requiring convicted offenders to serve in prison (without any reduction) the minimum or fixed term of imprisonment set by the court.
                  

                  
The parenthetic reference, ""without any reduction"", highlights a key difference between the regime of sentencing for which the Probation and Parole Act 1983 
                     N.S.W. provided and the new regime introduced by the Act which repealed the Probation and Parole Act. The key difference is the abolition of the system of remissions. Section 58(1) of the Act brought about this result by repealing that part of the Prisons Act 1952 
                     N.S.W. which dealt with the system of remissions. The system of remissions contributed to what was perceived to be a fictional element which had emerged in sentencing in New South Wales. That element arose from the combination of, on the one hand, a requirement imposed by s. 5(d) of the Probation and Parole Act that the sentencing judge specify a period before the expiration of which a person convicted was not to be released on probation and, on the other hand, the system whereby remissions of sentence were granted as a reward for good behaviour during imprisonment. The practical significance was that the official non-parole period was often substantially longer than the period actually served by a prisoner before release on parole. The appearance and reality of sentences imposed did not coincide: Reg. v. Maclay
                     
    [3]
  .



                            (1990) 19 N.S.W.L.R. 112, at pp. 121, 123.


                  
The Act sought to redress this situation and achieve ""truth in sentencing"" through the abolition of the system of remissions and the institution of a regime of fixed and minimum terms which accurately stated the period before which a prisoner was not eligible to be released. Section 5(1) in Pt 2 of the Act requires a court, when sentencing a person to imprisonment, to set a minimum term which must be served and an additional term during which the person may be released on parole. The additional term must not exceed one-third of the minimum term ""unless the court decides there are special circumstances"": s. 5(2). The term of the sentence of the court comprises the minimum and the additional term: s. 5(4). A court may decline to fix a minimum and an additional term and instead may impose a fixed term of imprisonment that must be served: s. 6(1). The legislative change is reflected in the different terminology employed to describe the sentences imposed under the Act, ""fixed"", ""minimum"" and ""additional"" terms being creatures of the new legislation and successors of the earlier expressions ""head sentence"" and ""non-parole period"".
               
               
                  
The transitional provisions
                  
For the sake of uniformity and, no doubt, ease of administration, the Act made provision for the redetermination of sentences imposed prior to its commencement so that those sentences could be expressed in accordance with the sentencing policy and terminology of the Act, specifically the policy that a term imposed as a fixed or minimum term accurately stated the period before which a prisoner was not to be released, whether at large or on parole. The ""Savings and Transitional Provisions"" of the Act, contained in Sched. 2 and designed to effect such redetermination, are set out in the joint judgment of Toohey and Gaudron JJ. It is sufficient for present purposes to observe that the transitional provisions take into account all remissions earned by prisoners prior to the coming into operation of the Act and assume, in favour of those prisoners, that they would have qualified for all available remissions or at least would not have forfeited their right to such remissions by any misconduct in the period between the time of redetermination and the end of their sentences: Sched. 2, cl. 4.
                  
For present purposes two aspects of Sched. 2 are important. First, sentences imposed before the commencement of the Act are not entirely redetermined by operation of law; that is, the Act, instead of bringing about a redetermination by force of the application of the provisions of Sched. 2, provides for a redetermination by the Offenders Review Board of the relevant non-parole or non-probation period on the basis that the prisoner would have received the maximum remissions possible under the Prisons Act: cl. 4(2). Secondly, the Schedule makes no provision for such a redetermination of a sentence imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal after the commencement of the Act when it quashes a sentence imposed before the commencement of the Act. The only provision in the Schedule which deals with resentencing by the Court of Criminal Appeal is that contained in cl. 8(2), a provision to which our attention was not directed in argument. Clause (8)2 provides:Part 2 [Sentencing] does not apply to a sentence of imprisonment or detention imposed on a person after the commencement of that Part if the sentence is imposed in proceedings to correct a sentence imposed before that commencement.On its face, the sub-clause appears to remove any obligation which might otherwise be imposed by s. 5 on the Court of Criminal Appeal to reassess sentences simply in the form of a ""minimum"" and an ""additional"" term. The sub-clause in terms appears to require the Court of Criminal Appeal to reassess a sentence as though the Act were not in operation. However, as will appear, cl. 8(2) has not been so interpreted.
               
               
                  
What is the correct approach to be adopted by the Court of Criminal Appeal?
                  
The question then is what approach should the Court of Criminal Appeal adopt in the situation in question. Should the Court simply apply s. 5 without regard to cl. 8(2) and the policy to which the clause gives expression? Or should it act in conformity with that policy and resentence the convicted person as if the Act were not in operation? Or should it initially assess a sentence and non-parole period which would be appropriate to the circumstances if the Probation and Parole Act and the relevant provisions of the Prisons Act had not been repealed and then redetermine the sentence as it would be redetermined under the Schedule if it had been imposed before the commencement of the Act?
                  
The Court of Criminal Appeal has held that cl. 8(2) does not exclude the operation of the Act in relation to sentences imposed by it in lieu of sentences quashed on appeal pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 
                     N.S.W., s. 6(3): Reg. v. Valentini
                     
    [1]
  . According to this interpretation, the operation of cl. 8(2) is restricted to the correction of an error in sentencing pursuant to an exercise of the power vested in the court by s. 19 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 
                     N.S.W.
                     
    [2]
  . The reason for this conclusion was succinctly expressed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in its judgment in Maclay 
                     
    [3]
   in these terms:This necessarily follows from the absence from Sched. 2 of any provision translating a fresh sentence so imposed by this Court after the commencement of the Act into a minimum period under the Act.Whatever one may say about cl. 8(2), the legislature plainly did not intend to bring about a resentencing by the Court of Criminal Appeal by reference to the requirements of the repealed legislation without translating the fresh sentence into the terminology of the new legislative regime. The provisions of s. 5 and Sched. 2 have as their object the bringing into existence of a comprehensive regime in which all sentences, new and old, are expressed according to the new terminology. And, as was noted in Valentini 
                     
    [4]
  , there are administrative and practical advantages in expressing all sentences according to the language of the Act.

The approach adopted by the Court of Criminal Appeal
                  
Faced with a choice between the first and third alternatives stated above, the Court of Criminal Appeal has held that the third alternative is the correct approach. Thus, in Reg. v. T.
                     
    [5]
   Campbell J. stated:Whilst the savings and transitional provisions require that the resentencing to be carried out by this Court, should it be held that the sentences imposed by the learned sentencing Judge be quashed, should be in accordance with Pt 2 of the Act, that Part does not either expressly or impliedly require that the Court depart from what in my opinion is the clear intention that prisoners sentenced before the Act took effect should be treated equally. It is to be observed in passing that Pt 2 does not itself make any direct reference to the remission system or its abolition.An example of the approach that a person is not to be disadvantaged by a legislative change occurring after the commission by him of an offence in the absence of a clearly expressed contrary intention, is to be found in s. 55 of the Interpretation Act 1987.
                     

                  




                            (1990) 47 A. Crim. R. 29.


                  
The provisions of Sched. 2 to the Act give the convicted person the benefit of all potential remissions available, a benefit which would not be available if the Court of Criminal Appeal were to apply what we have described above as the first approach. Campbell J. went on to say:In my view the appropriate course for this Court to adopt where called upon to resentence under Pt 2, after upholding an appeal against a sentence imposed before the Act, is to determine the sentence that would have been imposed had the Act not been enacted and then to apply the redetermination and translation provisions of the Act to that sentence. Such a procedure satisfies the requirement that the resentencing be under Part 2 and produces a sentence which conforms with requirements of the new sentencing scheme whilst ensuring that the appellant or respondent is treated in the same way as others sentenced at or about the same time as the sentence appealed from was imposed.(See also per Allen J.)
                  
The principle enunciated in T.  was followed by the Court of Criminal Appeal, differently constituted, in Bond v. The Queen
                     
    [6]
  . In that case, Badgery-Parker J. stated 
    [7]
  :Not only for reasons of comity, but also because I am satisfied that the approach outlined in Reg. v. T. is correct, the Court in the present matter should follow that decision.

In Reg. v. Maclay
                     
    [8]
  , the Court of Criminal Appeal (Gleeson C.J., Hunt and Loveday JJ.) stated:In successful appeals heard after 25 September from sentences imposed before that date, this Court has accordingly as a matter of course determined what sentences should have been imposed originally and then translated those sentences by reducing them in accordance with cll. 4-5 of Sched. 2: see eg, R. v. Burns
    [9]
  . We have done the same in relation to the separate appeal brought by this present applicant from the sentence imposed by Judge Ford before 25 September. The basis for doing so is the recognition of the injustice which would otherwise flow to the particular prisoner who otherwise would have had his sentence automatically translated to a minimum term which took into account the remissions to which he had become at least prospectively entitled. (Emphasis added.)

This decision, as well as the related appeal from the sentence imposed by Judge Ford which is referred to in the passage cited above, was delivered on 16 February 1990. The decision in Reg. v. Burns, also cited in the passage quoted, referred to the earlier decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Valentini . In that case, the Court stated 
    [10]
  :We also think that it is appropriate, from a practical point of view, that where this Court quashes a sentence imposed prior to the commencement of the 1989 Act, the new sentence be in accordance with the 1989 Act so that there can be uniformity within the Corrective Services administration. We have been informed that all sentences and non-parole periods existing as at the date upon which the new Act came into operation, namely, 25 September 1989 have already been converted to minimum and additional terms within the meaning of the 1989 legislation in accordance with that legislation. It is appropriate, therefore, from an administrative and practical point of view that we sentence the respondent in accordance with the 1989 Act.
                  




                            (1989) 46 A. Crim. R., at p. 27.


                  
This passage is not inconsistent with the T.  approach. True it is that the sentences imposed in Valentini  were expressed in the language of the Act, that is to say ""minimum"" and ""additional"" terms were imposed. But this was also the case in T.  where the Court first reassessed then redetermined the sentence in accordance with the principle in Sched. 2 to the Act. The expression of sentences in the language of the Act says nothing as to the approach the Court of Criminal Appeal in fact followed in arriving at those sentences. As we read the passage quoted from the judgment in Valentini , the sentences expressed as ""minimum"" and ""additional"" terms were reassessed and redetermined in the same way. In other words, they were first reassessed as if the Court of Criminal Appeal were imposing a sentence at the time when the original sentence was imposed, at which time authority dictated that, when setting a head sentence and non-parole period, the sentencing judge should not inflate the level of sentence to be imposed in order to compensate or account for any remissions that would flow to a prisoner: Reg. v. Paivinen
                     
    [11]
  ; Hoare v. The Queen
                     
    [12]
  ; Malvaso v. The Queen
                     
    [13]
  ; and Carbone v. The Queen
                     
    [14]
  . Once this reassessment had occurred, the sentences were then redetermined in accordance with the principle in Sched. 2. Our reading of Valentini  is confirmed by the statement made in Maclay  that the T.  approach was followed ""as a matter of course"" in New South Wales.

The T.  approach has been consistently followed in subsequent cases. The decision in Bond v. The Queen has already been referred to. In Reg. v. John
                     
    [15]
  , Samuels J.A., with whom Gleeson C.J. and Maxwell J. agreed, stated:I would respectfully adopt and apply the view of the majority in T., that, in effect, resentencing in cases such as the present requires a special methodology in order to ensure equivalence between what ought to have been done correctly under the old Act, and what must now be done under current legislation.The approach in T.  was further confirmed as the ""settled approach"" by the Court of Criminal Appeal (Gleeson C.J., Kirby P., Lusher A.J.) in Reg. v. Lian
                     
    [16]

The correctness of the T. approach
                  
Although the Crown in the present case conceded that the T.  approach was correct, some question was raised in argument about the soundness of that approach, the suggestion being that the Court of Criminal Appeal should, in the situation under discussion, proceed directly to apply s. 5 of the Act. In ordinary circumstances we would have some hesitation in expressing a firm view about a point not fully argued, but in this case we are impelled to say that we see no reason to doubt the correctness of the T.  approach. It has been adopted by the Court of Criminal Appeal in a long line of cases; it applies the Act in a manner favourable to convicted persons; it is accepted by the Crown as being correct; it gives effect to a sensible and commonsense approach yielding administrative and practical advantages; and it is a legitimate, indeed the only legitimate, interpretation that can be applied to the transitional provisions which appear, when viewed in their entirety, not to address the specific question, thereby creating an ambiguity.
                  
Both context and principle lend support to the T.  approach. In the context of an appeal against sentence, when a court of criminal appeal is called upon to resentence because it has quashed the sentence initially imposed, considerations of justice and equity ordinarily require that the convicted person be resentenced according to the law as it stood at the time when he was initially sentenced, particularly when that law was more favourable to him than the law as it existed at the hearing of the appeal. The convicted person had an entitlement when he was sentenced by the sentencing judge to a sentence imposed in conformity with the requirements of the law as it then stood. He should not be denied that entitlement simply because the sentencing judge made a mistake, whether that mistake resulted in a sentence that was too harsh or too lenient. In our view it would require a very clear indication of statutory intention to displace that entitlement. And, as we have noted, the Act is astute, in those matters to which it gives specific attention, to ensure that persons sentenced under the old regime are not disadvantaged by the legislative changes.
                  
In the first passage which we quoted earlier from the judgment of Campbell J. in T. , there was a reference to s. 55 of the Interpretation Act 1987 
                     N.S.W.. It is relevant also to refer to s. 30(1)(b) and (c) of that Act which provides that an amendment or a repeal of an Act does not affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued or incurred under the old legislation or any penalty incurred in respect of any offence arising under that legislation. True it is that, apart from cl. 8(2), the Act provides that sentences imposed after the commencement of the Act shall conform with the new regime. However, the general principles governing the interpretation of amending and repealing statutes support the view that the Act should be read as disclosing an intention that persons convicted and liable to be sentenced before the Act took effect should be treated equally and alike. 
               
               
                  
The history of the present case
                  
The applicant was charged with four offences under the Crimes Act 1900 
                     N.S.W. and was found guilty of one count under each of ss. 59, 61C(1) and 61D(1) of that Act, being acquitted of another count under s. 61D(1). The offences in question arose out of a single incident, details of which are briefly recounted in the joint judgment of Toohey and Gaudron JJ. and which need not be repeated here. On 1 September 1989 the applicant was sentenced on each count to three years imprisonment with a non-parole period of eighteen months in respect of each count. The sentences, imposed under the Probation and Parole Act, were to be served concurrently. The Act, which repealed the Probation and Parole Act, came into operation on 25 September 1989.
               
               
                  
The decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal
                  
On 18 October 1989, the Director of Public Prosecutions for the State of New South Wales sought leave to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal on the ground that the sentences imposed by the sentencing judge were inadequate. The Director obtained leave and was successful in the appeal. On 6 March 1990, the Court of Criminal Appeal (Samuels J.A., Wood and Badgery-Parker JJ.) substituted the following sentences:
                        

                           
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                       Count 4
                                       Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm (Section 59 Crimes Act)
                                       Fixed term of imprisonment for two years commencing on 11 August 1989 and entitling the applicant to release on 10 August 1991, subject to sentence imposed on count 1
                                    
                                    
                                       Count 2
                                       Sexual Intercourse Without Consent (s. 61D(1)Crimes Act)
                                       Fixed term of imprisonment for two and a half years commencing on 11 August 1989 and entitling the applicant to release on 10 February 1992, subject to sentence imposed on count 1
                                    
                                    
                                       Count 1
                                       Maliciously Inflict Actual Bodily Harm With Intent to Have Sexual Intercourse (s. 61C(1)Crimes Act)
                                       Minimum term of imprisonment of four and a half years commencing on 10 August 1991 and entitling the applicant to release on 10 February 1996 with an additional term of one and a half years commencing on 10 February 1996.
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     
As can be seen, the hearing of the appeal post-dated the repeal of the Probation and Parole Act and the coming into operation of the Act.
                  
In the present case, prior to the appeal, the three year sentence and eighteen month non-parole period initially imposed upon the applicant was redetermined in accordance with Sched. 2 and resulted in a ""minimum term"" of eleven months, fifteen days and an""additional term"" of eleven months, eight days. That sentence may be compared to the six and a half year ""minimum term"" and one and a half year ""additional term"" substituted by the Court of Criminal Appeal. The effect of the Court of Criminal Appeal's decision was, therefore, to increase the minimum period to be served by the applicant by a factor of approximately 6.8.
                  
Once it is accepted, as it must be, that the Court of Criminal Appeal came to the view that the original sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate, the question arises whether that Court adopted the T.  approach in resentencing the applicant. It is not clear from the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal what approach that Court in fact followed in arriving at the substituted sentences imposed upon the applicant. In argument, counsel for the Crown accepted that the T.  approach was correct and that it should have been applied in this case. The Crown's submission is simply that this case is not suitable for the grant of special leave to appeal. The Crown must therefore be understood as impliedly, and in our view rightly, conceding that the Court of Criminal Appeal did not follow the correct approach. The Court's reasons for judgment contain no indication that it embarked on the T.  approach.
               
               
                  
Should special leave be granted?
                  
The Crown opposes the grant of special leave on two grounds: first, that special leave should not be granted merely to correct sentences which are thought to be excessive and, secondly, that special leave should not be granted as the T.  approach had not been adopted by the Court of Criminal Appeal until after the delivery of its decision in the present case.
                  
With respect to the first of these objections, an application asserting no more than that a sentence imposed on appeal is excessive will not normally attract a grant of special leave: Colefax v. The Queen
                     
    [18]

With respect to the second objection, the circumstance that the T.  approach had not been adopted by the Court of Criminal Appeal until after its decision in the present case, even if it be true, is no answer to the contention that there was an error of principle embedded in the decision, though the objection might, in appropriate circumstances, provide another answer to the application for special leave, namely, that the question of principle was subsequently settled by later decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal. However, we are unable to accept that the T.  approach had not been applied before the decision in the present case. It appears from the earlier review of the authorities, which were not all cited to this Court in argument, that the Court of Criminal Appeal pursued an approach which was the same as the T.  approach in at least three of its decisions prior to the present case: Valentini, Burns and the separate unreported judgment in Maclay . And, in the passage from the reported judgment in Maclay 
                     
    [29]
  , which we have already quoted, the Court stated that it had followed that approach ""as a matter of course"" in successive appeals heard after 25 September 1989, the present case in our view being an exception to the generality of that statement. Hence, it appears that the Court of Criminal Appeal had proceeded to its decision in this case by following an approach inconsistent with settled principle. In that respect the decision is anomalous and it has resulted in an increase in the applicant's sentences by a factor of 6.8. This very considerable increase in the applicant's sentences may be attributable in part to the failure to apply the T.  approach, thereby reflecting a denial to the applicant of the benefit of taking into account the potential remissions to which he would have been entitled had that approach been applied.



                            (1990) 19 N.S.W.L.R., at pp. 124-125.


                  
The interests of the administration of justice warrant the grant of special leave to appeal in this particular case: Judiciary Act 1903 
                     Cth, s. 35A(b). Special leave should be granted by reason of the inconsistent approach of the Court of Criminal Appeal, proceeding from what appears to be an error of principle, which produced an unjust and anomalous result in the particular case.
               
               
                  
Conclusion
                  
The applicant has requested this Court to ""pass the sentence and non-parole period which should have been ordered by the Court of Criminal Appeal"". That is not a course which this Court will normally follow when special leave to appeal is granted and an appeal is allowed against a sentence. The normal course is to remit the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal which has the advantage of contemporary knowledge of both local conditions and local sentencing practices: Neal v. The Queen
                     
    [30]
  , per Gibbs C.J. Moreover, the Court of Criminal Appeal has the benefit, which this Court necessarily denies itself by virtue of its traditional reluctance to grant special leave to appeal against sentencing decisions, of practical experience in sentencing derived from the fact that it is regularly called upon to review the merits of sentences in the ordinary course of the administration of the criminal law: Veen 
                     
    [31]
  , per Aickin J.; Neal 
                     
    [32]
  , per Brennan J. The normal course should be adopted in this case. The matter should be remitted to the Court of Criminal Appeal to set the appropriate minimum and additional terms in light of the approach contended for by the applicant, agreed with by the Crown and followed by the Court of Criminal Appeal both before and after its decision in this case.

Dawson J.
               
This is an application for special leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon the applicant by the Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales (Samuels J.A., Wood and Badgery-Parker JJ.). The applicant was convicted in the District Court of one count (count 1) of maliciously inflicting actual bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse, one count (count 2) of sexual intercourse without consent and one count (count 4) of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He was acquitted of one count (count 3) of sexual intercourse without consent. He was sentenced to three years imprisonment on each count upon which he was convicted, to be served concurrently, with a non-probation period of eighteen months. The Crown appealed against the inadequacy of the sentence. The Court of Criminal Appeal allowed the appeal and varied the sentence as follows:Count 4: Fixed term of two years commencing 11/08/89, entitling [applicant] to be released, subject to sentence to be imposed on count 1, on 10/08/91.Count 2: Fixed term of two and a half years commencing 11/08/89 entitling [applicant] to be released 10/02/92 subject to sentence to be imposed on count 1.
                     
Count 1: Term of penal servitude of four and a half years commencing 10/08/91 entitling [applicant] to be released on parole on 10/02/96, and an additional term of one and a half years commencing 10/02/96.
                  

               

               
Between the date upon which the applicant was originally sentenced and the date upon which the Court of Criminal Appeal imposed its sentence, the Sentencing Act 1989 
                  N.S.W. came into force. One of the objects of that Act, expressed in s. 3(a), is ""to promote truth in sentencing by requiring convicted offenders to serve in prison (without any reduction) the minimum or fixed term of imprisonment set by the court"". That part of the Prisons Act 1952 
                  N.S.W. dealing with remissions is repealed together with the whole of the Probation and Parole Act 1983 
                  N.S.W.. Section 5 of the Sentencing Act requires a court when sentencing a person to imprisonment for an offence, firstly, to set a minimum term of imprisonment that the person must serve for the offence and, secondly, to set an additional term during which the person may be released on parole. Unless there are special circumstances, the additional term must not exceed one-third of the minimum term. As an alternative, a court may, in the circumstances set out in s. 6, decline to set minimum and additional terms and set instead a fixed term of imprisonment that the person must serve for the offence. Under s. 9, if a court imposes a further term of imprisonment which is to be cumulative on a previous sentence which has a minimum term, the further sentence must commence at the end of the minimum term of the previous sentence. If there is an appeal against sentence, the court of appeal may, under s. 11, vary any minimum and additional terms, rescind any minimum and additional terms and instead set a fixed term or rescind a fixed term and set minimum and additional terms, but in doing so must comply with Pt 2 of the Act which is the Part dealing with sentencing. Section 11 does not limit any other power of the court in determining an appeal.
               
Section 57 of the Sentencing Act, under the heading ""Savings and transitional provisions"", provides that Sched. 2 has effect. Schedule 2 provides, in substance, for the redetermination of existing sentences by the Offenders Review Board upon the repeal of the Probation and Parole Act by reducing the non-parole or non-probation period of each sentence by any remissions already earned and the maximum remissions which might have been earned under the Prisons Act. A sentence so redetermined is to be translated into a minimum term and an additional term calculated in accordance with a formula provided by Sched. 2. Schedule 2 also provides in cl. 8(2) that Pt 2 of the Act does not apply to a sentence imposed after the commencement of that Part if the sentence is imposed in proceedings to correct a sentence imposed before that commencement. It was not submitted, nor in my view could it be, that this provision has any application upon appeal. It is quite obviously a reference to the procedure under s. 19 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 
                  N.S.W. whereby a court may reopen proceedings to correct sentencing errors. Thus there is no provision that Pt 2 does not apply on appeal and it was common ground that it applied in this case in the proceedings before the Court of Criminal Appeal.
               
Shortly after the decision in this case a differently constituted Court of Criminal Appeal (Gleeson C.J., Campbell and Allen JJ.) heard an appeal against sentence by a prisoner in the case of Reg. v. T.
                  
    [33]
  . In that case, Campbell and Allen JJ. allowed the appeal and held that, as the original sentence had been imposed before the Sentencing Act came into force, the Court, whilst resentencing in accordance with Pt 2 of the Act, should determine the sentence that ought to have been imposed had the Act not been enacted and should then apply the redetermination and translation provisions of Sched. 2 of the Act to that sentence. It was said that this procedure was justified so that the prisoner would spend no longer in custody than he would have done if the appropriate sentence had been imposed in the first place. Gleeson C.J., who dismissed the appeal, did not find it necessary to decide whether the procedure adopted by the other two members of the Court was appropriate, but observed that if it were ""it would mean that any re-determined sentence  would be influenced by special considerations not applicable to offenders coming up for sentence for the first time under the new legislation"".



                         (1990) 47 A. Crim. R. 29.


               
Subsequently, in Bond v. The Queen
                  
    [34]
   the Court of Criminal Appeal (Kirby P., Wood and Badgery-Parker JJ.) adopted the procedure suggested in Reg. v. T., but Kirby P. observed that for his part he adopted it ""without intellectual persuasion"" because the Crown accepted that it was the approach which should be taken.



                         (1990) 48 A. Crim. R. 1.


               
In this case the applicant's original sentence was redetermined by the Offenders Review Board and translated under the Sentencing Act with the result that he was to serve a minimum term of eleven months fifteen days imprisonment expiring on 25 July 1990 with an additional term expiring on 3 July 1991. It is conceded by the Crown that, if the sentence imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal under Pt 2 of the Sentencing Act, amounting in effect to a total of six and a half years minimum term plus an additional term of one and a half years, were to be converted back into a sentence imposed in accordance with the law before the Sentencing Act came into force, it would amount to a sentence of approximately twelve years and nine months with a non-parole or non-probation period of ten years and four months. I should say that I doubt whether such a conversion back is a useful exercise. There does not appear to be any warrant for regarding the provision made in the Sentencing Act for the redetermination of existing sentences as intended for the calculation of an appropriate sentence otherwise than for the purposes of transition to the new scheme. The Crown also conceded that the Court of Criminal Appeal in this case ought to have applied the procedure adopted in Reg. v. T. Of course it did not, Reg. v. T. not having been decided at the time, and the procedure not having gained general acceptance in the Court of Criminal Appeal before that case.
               
Notwithstanding the concession made by the Crown, I am not presently persuaded that the procedure adopted in Reg. v. T. is correct, having regard to the provisions of the Sentencing Act. Despite the existence of savings and transitional provisions in Sched. 2, none was provided in relation to resentencing upon appeal. The Court of Criminal Appeal was required to impose an appropriate sentence under Pt 2, not under the law as it existed before Pt 2 came into force. Obviously, the Court considered the sentence imposed by it to be the appropriate sentence under Pt 2 of the Act.
               
The transitional provisions for redetermining existing sentences contained in the Sentencing Act might be thought to be generous but necessary to gain acceptance of the scheme of the Act and to enable it to be implemented completely and immediately. There was no similar need for generosity in resentencing upon appeal and the Act does not display it. The Act contemplates a disparity between prisoners whose sentences have been redetermined and translated under the Sentencing Act and those who have been sentenced under Pt 2 of that Act. Such a disparity would seem to be inevitable. But that is the result of the scheme adopted and of the requirement that it be given effect at a particular juncture. Nor does the Act provide for a modified application of Pt 2 in resentencing upon appeal, any more than it does so in relation to the imposition of sentences for offences committed before the Sentencing Act came into force. In this respect a comparison may be made with the Probation and Parole Act which, before its repeal, was amended by the insertion of s. 20A dealing with minimum non-parole periods for serious offences. That section was expressed not to apply to offences committed before the commencement of the section which was 1 January 1988.
               
However, in the absence of full argument upon the point it would be wrong of this Court to express any concluded view about the procedure adopted in Reg. v. T. Even if it be submitted without contest, as it was, that the Court of Criminal Appeal was in error in this case in not adopting the procedure adopted in Reg. v. T., it would be inappropriate to grant special leave for the purpose of endorsing that procedure without argument from the Crown.
               
In the end, the ground upon which the applicant must rely is that the sentence imposed upon him by the Court of Criminal Appeal was excessive. Notwithstanding that the interests of the administration of justice in the particular case (see now Judiciary Act 1903 
                  Cth, s. 35A(b)) have always been a matter to be taken into account in considering whether to grant an application for special leave to appeal, the grant of special leave remains discretionary and there must be some special feature of the case which warrants the attention of this Court. If mere error in the individual case were sufficient to justify the grant of special leave, there would be no difference between ordinary leave to appeal and special leave to appeal: cf. White v. The Queen
                  
    [35]
  . Accordingly, where an application for special leave to appeal is against sentence alone, this Court has consistently taken the view that special leave should be granted only where there has been an error of law or a gross violation of the principles of sentencing. Mere excessiveness of sentence has never, of itself, been an adequate ground for the grant of special leave to appeal: Colefax v. The Queen
                  
    [36]
  ; Lowe v. The Queen
                  
    [7]
  . Not only does such an approach accord generally with the principles upon which special leave to appeal is granted, but it also gives recognition to the advantages which the Courts of Criminal Appeal in the States have because of their knowledge of local conditions and local sentencing practices: Neal v. The Queen

The sentence imposed by the trial judge was lenient, particularly when redetermined and translated under the Sentencing Act. The increase in the term of imprisonment imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal under Pt 2 of that Act does not disclose any error in the exercise of its discretion and there is nothing, in my view, to attract the grant of special leave to appeal. Special leave should be refused.
            


               
Toohey and Gaudron JJ.
               
This application for special leave to appeal concerns the operation of the Sentencing Act 1989 
                  N.S.W.. The long title to that Act describes it as an Act ""to promote truth in sentencing; to provide for the procedure to be followed in sentencing prisoners to imprisonment and for the release of prisoners on parole; to repeal the Probation and Parole Act 1983 and amend certain other Acts; and for other purposes"". What is at issue is the operation of the Sentencing Act when an offender is resentenced by the Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales following an appeal to that Court, the original sentence having been imposed before that Act came into operation.
               
On 28 June 1985, the applicant was charged with a number of offences, all arising out of an incident some two months earlier. He was indicted before a jury on four counts under the Crimes Act 1900 
                  N.S.W., as follows: (1) maliciously inflicting actual bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse (s. 61C(1)); 2. and 3. sexual intercourse without consent (s. 61D(1)); 4. assault occasioning actual bodily harm (s. 59).
               
The applicant stood trial but in March 1987 the jury was unable to reach a verdict. He was admitted to bail until the conclusion of his retrial on 11 August 1989. This time he was found guilty on counts 1, 2 and 4 but not guilty on count 3. On 1 September 1989, his Honour Judge Flannery in the District Court of New South Wales sentenced the applicant to three years imprisonment on each count, to be served concurrently and to date from 11 August 1989. His Honour fixed a non-probation period of eighteen months to commence from 11 August 1989.
               
The Sentencing Act came into operation on 25 September 1989; Pt 2 is headed ""Sentencing"". Section 5(1) requires a court, when sentencing a person to imprisonment for an offence, to set a minimum term that must be served and an additional term during which the person may be released on parole. The additional term must not exceed one-third of the minimum term ""unless the court decides there are special circumstances"": s. 5(3). The minimum and additional terms together comprise ""the term of the sentence of the court for the offence"": s. 5(4). A court may, in the circumstances referred to in s. 6(2), decline to fix minimum and additional terms and may set instead a fixed term of imprisonment that must be served. See also s. 11(1)(b). The system of remissions in operation for many years has ceased to exist.
               
Section 57 of the Sentencing Act reads: ""Schedule 2 has effect."" Schedule 2 is headed ""Savings and Transitional Provisions"". Clause 5(1) of Sched. 2 provides that every sentence of imprisonment to which a person was subject immediately before the repeal of the Probation and Parole Act 1983 
                  N.S.W. (which statute was in force when the applicant was sentenced by Judge Flannery), and in respect of which a non-parole or non-probation period then applied:shall be taken to be a sentence consisting of —
                        
(a) a minimum term determined under this clause; and

                        
                        
(b) an additional term determined under this clause.

                        
                     

                  
This was done so as to bring existing sentences into line with those fixed in accordance with the new legislation.
               
The ""minimum term"" is the period from the commencement of the sentence to the end of the non-parole or non-probation period ""as redetermined under clause 4"": cl. 5(2). The ""additional term"" is the period from the end of the minimum term so determined to the end of the sentence, ""as reduced by any existing remission as referred to in clause 3"": cl. 5(3). Minimum and additional terms determined under cl. 5 of Sched. 2 ""are to be taken to have been set under Part 2"": cl. 5(6). Clause 4 of Sched. 2 redetermines the non-parole or non-probation period of a former sentence by reducing that period by the total of any existing remission (as referred to in cl. 3) and all future remissions to which the prisoner might have become entitled (as estimated in accordance with cl. 4) had the former provisions relating to remission continued in force. Put shortly, the Offenders Review Board constituted by s. 44 of the Sentencing Act is to make a redetermination of the relevant non-parole or non-probation period on the basis that the prisoner would have received the maximum remission possible under s. 64(1)(a) and (b) of the Prisons Act 1952 
                  N.S.W.. Section 64 fell within Pt 11 of the Prisons Act; that Part was omitted by Sched. 3 to the Sentencing Act. The section contained a formula for the calculation of remissions. Consistent with Pt 2 of the Sentencing Act, the minimum term to which cl. 5(1)(a) of Sched. 2 refers is the period from the commencement of sentence until a time which equates with the non-parole or non-probation period fixed by the court, less the period of remissions. To the period thus redetermined must be added the ""additional term"" which is the period from the end of the minimum term, as redetermined, to the end of the sentence, as reduced (in the present case) by any remission to which the prisoner would have been entitled under Pt 11 of the Prisons Act. The effect of s. 57 and Sched. 2 is that the non-probation period to which the applicant was subject became a minimum term of eleven months fifteen days expiring on 25 July 1990, with an ""additional term"" expiring on 3 July 1991.
               
The Crown appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal on the ground that the sentence imposed by the District Court was inadequate. The appeal was allowed and the Court substituted sentences as follows:
                     
1. Sexual intercourse without consent (count 2) — a fixed term of imprisonment for two and a half years beginning on 11 August 1989 and entitling the applicant to be released on 10 February 1992, subject to the sentence imposed on the first count.

                     
                     
2. Assault occasioning actual bodily harm (count 4) — a fixed term of imprisonment for two years beginning on 11 August 1989 and entitling the applicant to be released on 10 August 1991, again subject to the sentence imposed on the first count.

                     
                     
3. Maliciously inflicting actual bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse (count 1) — a term of imprisonment for four and a half years beginning on 10 August 1991 and making the applicant eligible for release on parole on 10 February 1996, with an additional term of one and a half years beginning on 10 February 1996.

                     
                  
Having determined those sentences as appropriate, Samuels J.A., with whom the other members of the Court of Criminal Appeal agreed, added:We impose the fixed terms by reason of the penalty imposed in respect of the first count and with the view that any further additional term would serve no purpose.
               

               
There are a number of grounds of appeal, most of which are unlikely to attract a grant of special leave for they do no more than attempt to argue that the sentences imposed by Judge Flannery were not inappropriate. Only two aspects of the grounds require any consideration by this Court.
               
The first aspect fastens on to the role of the Court of Criminal Appeal in reviewing the sentence and the non-parole period fixed by a sentencing judge. As to that, the Court of Criminal Appeal concluded that, having regard to all the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offences, the sentences imposed by the District Court were manifestly inadequate. With that conclusion there can be no quarrel. On any view they were serious offences. It is unnecessary to recount the events in any detail. It is enough to say that the applicant was a member of a band which was playing at a restaurant. After closing time the band stayed on because of a party taking place in the restaurant. The complainant had arrived while the party was in progress and joined some people whom she knew. Accounts differed of her conduct while she was at the party but there was evidence that she was dancing, as Samuels J.A. put it, ""in a somewhat uninhibited fashion"". There is no doubt that she had something to drink before she arrived at the party and more drinks thereafter. However, it follows from the jury's verdict that they rejected the applicant's account of sexual intercourse by consent (although they could not have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the complainant's evidence as to a subsequent act of oral intercourse), that they accepted the complainant's evidence as to the violence accompanying the act of sexual intercourse and that they accepted her account of a subsequent act of gratuitous violence.
               
The Court of Criminal Appeal firmly rejected an approach which the Court thought underlay the remarks of the sentencing judge and the submissions of the applicant's counsel on appeal, namely, that the complainant was to some extent the author of her own misfortune. The Court concluded that, taking into account all that could be said on the applicant's behalf including his good reputation and employment record and the time spent in custody before sentence, ""these sentences were manifestly inadequate"". The applicant has not shown that in reaching its conclusion the Court of Criminal Appeal erred in any way.
               
There is, however, another aspect of the matter and it bears upon the way in which the Court of Criminal Appeal went about its task of resentencing the applicant. The applicant's submission was that, his original sentence having been fixed before the Act came into operation, the proper approach for the Court of Criminal Appeal was to consider what was an appropriate sentence before that time, namely, when the applicant was originally sentenced, and then ""translate"" that sentence in accordance with Sched. 2 to give effect to the provisions of the Sentencing Act. The question is one of principle but it is of some importance to see the implications of the applicant's argument. He contended that the result of the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal was to increase the original sentences imposed by Judge Flannery, if translated under Sched. 2, by 6.8 times and, further, that the sentences imposed by that Court, viewed against the sentencing provisions existing before the Sentencing Act came into force, amount to an aggregate sentence of twelve years, with a non-parole period of about ten years. In response, Ms. Payne for the Crown said:we did an inquiry on a back conversion of the six-and-a-half year minimum with the one-and-a-half additional and figures were in fact given that that converted to a sentence of twelve years nine months approximately, with ten years four months and seven days.
               

               
The applicant contended, and the Crown accepted, that the proper approach to be taken in the circumstances is to be found in Reg. v. T., a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales (Gleeson C.J., Campbell and Allen JJ.) 
    [10]
  . The question whether an appellate court may have regard to the redetermination principles in Sched. 2 to the Sentencing Act and the further question whether the sentencing discretion of such a court is fettered by the ""T. approach"" are not before this Court for decision. However, given the agreement between the parties, there is no reason why this Court should not accept the approach taken in Reg. v. T. for the purpose of determining the application. But it must be noted that the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in the instant case was delivered on 6 March 1990, just over a week before judgment was delivered in Reg. v. T. A question therefore arises as to whether, in any event, the Court of Criminal Appeal erred in failing to review the sentences in accordance with the approach taken in that decision, assuming that approach to be correct. First, however, it is necessary to see what Reg. v. T. decided.



                         (1990) 47 A. Crim. R. 29.


               
The leading judgment in that case was delivered by Allen J. who observed:The effect of the Sentencing Act upon the re-sentencing of persons previously sentenced under the former legislation is a different question from that of what sentencing levels generally are appropriate under the new legislation. It is a different question because in re-sentencing it would be offensive to the spirit of the common law and in breach of the legislative intention manifest in the translation provisions of the Sentencing Act for the prisoner to be worse off, in terms of time spent in custody, than he would have been if the appropriate sentence had been passed in the first place. It must be recognized, in considering sentencing levels, that sentences imposed by way of re-sentence where the prisoner had been sentenced under the former legislation are in a special category.Campbell J. spoke to like effect. Gleeson C.J. dissented in the result of the appeal and therefore found it unnecessary to express a view as to the approach to be taken to resentencing in the circumstances then before the Court.
               
In Bond v. The Queen
                  
    [11]
  , Wood J. and Badgery-Parker J. each expressed concurrence with the approach taken by the majority in Reg. v. T. Kirby P. was reluctant to accept that approach, inter alia regarding a court as bound, once a sentence had been set aside, to resentence in accordance with the law in force at the time of resentence. Nevertheless, because of existing authority, in particular Reg. v. T., and because, in Bond v. The Queen, the Crown accepted the approach in Reg. v. T. as correct, Kirby P. said: ""In such circumstances, although without intellectual persuasion, I believe that it is the course that I should take here.""
               


Unreported; 12 April 1990; Court of Criminal Appeal (N.S.W.).


               
As already indicated, the Crown has taken the same stand in the instant case, thereby making a review by this Court of the principles canvassed in Reg. v. T. inappropriate on this occasion. What then is there about the application to attract a grant of special leave to appeal?
               
As Mason J. pointed out in Veen v. The Queen
                  
    [12]
  :It is not the practice of this Court to grant special leave to appeal against sentence. This is because appeals against sentence rarely involve a point of law of general application (White v. The Queen
    [13]
  ).See also Lowe v. The Queen
                  
    [14]
  . For this reason, an application for special leave to appeal that asserts no more than that the sentence is excessive cannot ordinarily expect to attract a grant of special leave. However, it is necessary to bear in mind that s. 35A of the Judiciary Act 1903 
                  Cth, inserted by Act No. 12 of 1984, now requires this Court, in considering whether to grant an application for special leave to appeal, to have regard to a number of matters including:(b) whether the interests of the administration of justice, either generally or in the particular case, require consideration by the High Court of the judgment to which the application relates.
               




                         (1979) 143 C.L.R. 458, at p. 467.

                         (1984) 154 C.L.R. 606.


               
In our view the interests of the administration of justice in the particular case do require consideration by this Court of the judgment to which the application relates. In the Court of Criminal Appeal, Samuels J.A. mentioned the Sentencing Act in the context of the redetermination that followed the coming into operation of that Act. But there is nothing in the judgment of his Honour that expressly, or indeed by implication, indicates that the Court was applying the principles adopted in Reg. v. T., that is, that the Court was placing itself in the position of the sentencing judge as at the time the applicant was first sentenced, was assessing appropriate sentences as at that time and was then redetermining the appropriate minimum and additional terms. Indeed, it is a reasonable inference that the Court did not approach the resentencing of the applicant in that way for one might have expected the Court to say so. Cf. Reg. v. John
                  
    [15]
   where the ""T.approach"" was expressly applied in resentencing on appeal. In that event it is likely that the Court, in resentencing the applicant, applied principles different from those which the Court of Criminal Appeal adopted in Reg. v. T. and, it is to be assumed, in all comparable cases decided since then. To that extent the position of the applicant is anomalous. The number of prisoners who will be affected by the ""T. approach"" must be limited but, among those prisoners, the applicant has been resentenced according to principles which are not those now applied and which have resulted in a longer term of imprisonment than would otherwise have been the case.


Unreported; 17 July 1990; Court of Criminal Appeal (N.S.W.) (Gleeson C.J., Samuels J.A., Maxwell J.).


               
The position is that the applicant received from the Court of Criminal Appeal sentences totalling more than twelve years imprisonment when viewed at the time the original sentences were imposed. Having regard to the maximum sentences applicable (twelve years imprisonment under s. 61C(1), eight years under s. 61D(1) and five years under s. 59), the fact that all offences arose from the one incident and that the offences, though serious, were not ""the worst crimes that can be imagined in these categories"", to borrow the language of Samuels J.A., it does seem that the interests of the administration of justice require consideration by this Court of the sentences imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal. That consideration leads to the conclusion that, although the sentences imposed by Judge Flannery were inadequate, the sentences imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal are excessive. And the likelihood is that they are excessive because the Court of Criminal Appeal did not approach resentencing on what has become that Court's approach to resentencing in the case of a prisoner who was sentenced before the Sentencing Act came into force. For these reasons, the intervention of this Court is warranted.
               
To put the matter in this way is not to overlook the fact that it is ""special"" leave to appeal that is sought. But it is to recognise that there is something in the administration of justice in the case in hand that calls for consideration by this Court of the judgment below even though the other considerations to which s. 35A of the Judiciary Act refers, and considerations flowing from decisions of this Court before s. 35A was enacted, may not advance the applicant's position in this regard. That consideration alone may satisfy the Court that a grant of special leave is warranted. This is such a case.
               
The draft notice of appeal invites the Court to ""pass the sentence and non-parole period which should have been ordered by the Court of Criminal Appeal"". But it is preferable that the matter be remitted to the Court of Criminal Appeal to set the appropriate minimum and additional (or fixed) terms in the light of the principles adopted in Reg. v. T., not because those principles have the endorsement of this Court, but because they are accepted by the Crown as applicable and now have the endorsement of the Court of Criminal Appeal.",1990-12-13 00:00:00,High Court of Australia

The following written judgments were delivered:—



               Nov 17
               Mason C.J., Deane and Dawson JJ.
               
The appellant was convicted of the murder of Hartwig Bayerl and Susan Zack and of the theft of a vessel, the Immanuel, which had been owned by Bayerl. Bayerl and Zack had met in Cairns in April 1989 at the Cairns Cruising Yacht Squadron and commenced to live together. The Immanuel was a 36-foot cutter upon which Bayerl had spent most of his savings. In the following months Zack spent most of her savings on alterations to the boat. Zack's parents, who lived in England, visited her in Australia in June 1989 and Bayerl asked Zack's father whether he could marry Zack. Her parents urged her to delay the wedding as she had only known Bayerl a few months. She agreed and her parents said that if the couple still wanted to get married after cruising the Pacific together, they would fly out for the wedding.
               
The appellant answered an advertisement by Bayerl for casual labour to work on the boat in August 1989. He agreed to work for no wages and, in return, Zack and Bayerl agreed to take him on their cruise. The accused suggested to the police that there may have been more to this arrangement, but refused to elaborate. The appellant and Bayerl were both Austrian and they soon became friends. The three worked hard on the alterations to the boat, often late into the night.
               
The Immanuel was launched at the end of September 1989, but was put back into dry dock because it sprang a leak. It was relaunched a little over two weeks later. Bayerl and Zack wound up their affairs in Cairns late in October 1989. They sold Zack's car. They were keen to set out on their cruise because the Coral Sea is prone to cyclones between November and March. The last known contacts with Bayerl and Zack were in late November. Zack wrote a letter to her sister which was postmarked 22 November 1989. She was over four months pregnant and saw her doctor on 24 November 1989. She said that she would go to a doctor or clinic once a month and hoped to have the baby in hospital, possibly in Cairns. Zack saw a friend in Cairns late in November and said that they were intending to leave that day. She wrote a cheque dated 26 November and used her credit card at the Cairns Liquor Barn on 27 November.
               
Bayerl rang his mother in Austria on 26 November 1989 and said that he was leaving soon. There was evidence given by one witness who claimed to have seen Bayerl early in December 1989, but this date was not supported by any other evidence. In late November 1989 the boat was seen near Fitzroy Island, about 15 nautical miles from Cairns, with the appellant, Bayerl and Zack aboard. Bayerl and Zack were never seen again. The Immanuel was seen again in Cairns harbour in late December 1989 and in January 1990 but only the appellant was observed to be on board.
               
On 3 January 1990, the appellant asked the Australian Customs Service about a customs clearance. Because he had contravened the conditions of his multiple journey visit visa, his visa was cancelled, effectively requiring him to leave Australia by 25 January 1990. He said that this would not fit in with his plans because the boat's owner, Bayerl, was in Kuranda, a town on the edge of the Atherton Tablelands a short distance to the north-west of Cairns.
               
A port officer in Cairns was telephoned by Zack's mother in an effort to convey to Zack the news that her aunt had died. The officer spoke to the appellant on board the Immanuel on 4 January 1990 who said that Bayerl and Zack were not on board and would be on the Atherton Tablelands until about 10 January 1990. The appellant promised to pass on the message from Zack's mother.
               
The Immanuel appears to have left Cairns harbour by 7 January 1990, but it had returned by 12 January when the appellant told an immigration official that he was now intending to meet Bayerl in Papua New Guinea and would leave Australia permanently in the next few days. The appellant cleared Australian customs on 16 January 1990 and presumably left early the next morning.
               
The appellant spent some eight months cruising between various Pacific islands. He told a number of people that he had been turned away from Bougainville by the Papua New Guinea Navy. He arrived alone on board the Immanuel in Kosrae on 21 February 1990 and stayed there for two or three days. He then sailed to Kiribati, arriving on 16 March 1990. He was due to leave by 23 March 1990. He sailed on to Majuro in the Marshall Islands and for three months between March and June worked there as a cabinet-maker. In order to comply with Marshall Islands visa requirements, he returned to Kiribati on 25 June 1990, where he remained at least until 6 July before returning to Majuro on about 11 July 1990.
               
As a result of Interpol searches for the Immanuel and Bayerl and Zack, the appellant was taken into custody by the Marshall Islands authorities in August 1990. Australian police arrived in Majuro late in August and conducted a series of tape-recorded interviews with the appellant on 27, 28 and 30 August and 2 September 1990. The appellant attempted to escape from custody on 3 September 1990 by swimming to a nearby island but was recaptured. On 4 September a judge made an order allowing the appellant to return to Australia and he agreed to return with the police. He was charged in Cairns on 6 September 1990 with the murder of Bayerl and Zack and the theft of the Immanuel.
               
The prosecution case against the appellant was entirely circumstantial. There was abundant evidence from which the jury might have concluded that Bayerl and Zack were not only missing but dead. All contact between them and their respective families ceased notwithstanding that they had previously kept in regular contact. They did not attempt to operate their bank accounts. There was no record of any medical treatment of Zack or the birth of a child. Nappies, maternity bras and vitamin supplements which Zack had presumably bought for her pregnancy remained on board the Immanuel when it was searched by the police at Majuro in August 1990.
               
Upon the assumption that Bayerl and Zack were dead, there was evidence from which it might have been concluded that the appellant had not only stolen the boat but had also been involved in their deaths. They had spent a large amount of money on the Immanuel of which the appellant had assumed sole possession. On board the vessel were many of Zack's clothes, her diving watch and a gold bracelet which she wore almost continuously. Also on board were opals which Bayerl intended to sell around the Pacific together with an opal pendant which Bayerl wore when selling opals. There was Bayerl's German bible, given to him by his father, which Bayerl always took with him, even on camping trips, and to which he referred regularly. There was camping equipment belonging to Bayerl and Zack, and, concealed, there were two rifles which had been in Bayerl's possession since 1986. There was evidence that Bayerl was a well-organized traveller who always ensured that he was well-equipped. The presence of the various items on the boat was inconsistent with Bayerl or Zack having left it voluntarily.
               
In his travels around the Pacific, the appellant told a series of inconsistent stories about the identity of the owner of the boat and the whereabouts of Bayerl and Zack. His original story, told to Australian officials in early January 1990, was that Bayerl and Zack were in Kuranda or on the Atherton Tablelands. In the middle of January he told a customs official that Bayerl was in Papua New Guinea and that he would be picking him up from Port Moresby.
               
When he first landed at Kosrae on 21 February 1990, the appellant told a sailor that he had bought the boat from an old man in Cairns. He gave a similar story to a customs official in Kosrae and again to his employers in Majuro in about April 1990.
               
When he returned to Kiribati in late June 1990, the appellant told the police that Bayerl had given or lent him the boat for cruising and that Bayerl and Zack were in Kununurra in the north-west of Australia. A week or two later, the appellant told a customs officer in Kiribati that Bayerl owned the boat and was staying at Zack's place in Cairns.
               
On 17 August 1990, the appellant told the Majuro police that Bayerl and Zack were in Western Australia. He gave the same story to the Australian police in Majuro, adding that he had dropped them off in Cairns with minimal equipment and that they had intended to make their own way to Kununurra. He said that they were now living off the land at Kununurra and that he was waiting in Majuro for a letter from Bayerl. Extensive inquiries made in Kununurra and the surrounding regions revealed no trace of Bayerl or Zack, although some people remembered Bayerl from a previous visit in 1986.
               
After his arrest, the appellant told two friends in Majuro that Bayerl and Zack had smuggled arms to Bougainville and that he had dropped them off there. He said he was waiting in Majuro for contact from Bayerl.
               
In Kiribati in March 1990, the appellant repainted the name of the boat as ""Mani"" which he said was a contraction of his own name, Manfred, although it could also be a contraction of Immanuel.
               
Whilst the appellant was in custody in Majuro, a friend urged him to return to Australia to face charges and the appellant said, ""But they have nothing. They have no bodies. They have no proof."" While in gaol in Australia the appellant told a fellow prisoner, ""Die kan die zwei nicht finden"", which the prisoner translated as, ""They'll never find those two"", although a more accurate translation is ""They cannot find those two"".
               
The appellant gave no evidence at his trial, nor did he call any evidence.
               
The appellant's appeal against his conviction was dismissed by the Queensland Court of Appeal. He now appeals to this Court. The only ground of appeal which was argued is that the trial judge erred in directing the jury that they might more safely draw an inference of guilt from the evidence because the appellant did not give evidence of relevant facts which could be perceived to be within his knowledge.
               
The learned trial judge adverted in his summing-up to the use which the jury might make of the appellant's silence at his trial on two occasions. He said:As has already been said to you, the Crown bears the onus of satisfying you beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of the offences with which he is charged. The accused bears no onus. He does not have to prove anything. For that reason he was under no obligation to give evidence. You cannot infer guilt simply from his failure to do so. The consequence of that failure is this: you have no evidence from the accused to add to, or explain, or to vary, or contradict the evidence put before you by the prosecution. Moreover, this is a case in which the truth is not easily, you might think, ascertainable by the prosecution. It asks you to infer guilt from a whole collection of circumstances. It asks you to draw inferences from such facts as it is able to prove. Such an inference may be more safely drawn from the proven facts when an accused person elects not to give evidence of relevant facts which it can easily be perceived must be within his knowledge. You might, for example, think in this case it requires no great perception that the accused would have direct knowledge of events which can be canvassed only obliquely from the point of view of seeking to have you draw an inference from the evidence which has been led by the Crown. The use that you make of the fact that there is no evidence given or called by the defendant in these proceedings is that.Subsequently he said:I remind you that the onus is on the prosecution and the fact that the accused has not given or called evidence proves nothing. I remind you that the consequence of that circumstance is that you have no evidence from the accused to explain the evidence put before you by the prosecution, and that moreover, this is a case where the truth is not easily ascertainable by the prosecution. You remember rather here it seeks to have you infer guilt from such facts as it is able to prove to your satisfaction. Such an inference may be more safely drawn from the proven facts when the accused elects not to give evidence of relevant facts which can be easily perceived to be in his knowledge.
               

               
In Queensland a trial judge is not precluded from commenting on the failure of an accused to give evidence as judges are in other jurisdictions 
    [1]
  . However, the right of the jury to take into account the silence of the accused does not stem from the right of the trial judge to comment upon it. Even in those jurisdictions where comment is prohibited, the jury may consider the accused's silence. The prohibition merely forbids the trial judge from reminding them that they may do so and informing them of the way in which they may properly do so. Where the legislature has forbidden comment it has presumably done so because it considers that it is more in the interests of the accused to prohibit than to allow comment 
    [2]
  . In a modern context, however, where at least some members of every jury will know and be conscious of the fact that an accused can give evidence, that approach may now be mistaken. The jury may read more into the silence of an accused than they are entitled to do and, as a result, the accused may be at a greater disadvantage than if comment by the trial judge were allowed.

The reasoning process whereby the failure of a party to give or to call evidence is taken into account in evaluating evidence which is before the court has long been recognized by the law and is not confined to the criminal law. In Blatch v Archer  Lord Mansfield observed 
    [3]
  :It is certainly a maxim that all evidence is to be weighed according to the proof which it was in the power of one side to have produced, and in the power of the other to have contradicted.And in R v Burdett , a case which was decided before an accused could give evidence on his or her own behalf, Abbott C.J. said 
    [4]
  :In drawing an inference or conclusion from facts proved, regard must always be had to the nature of the particular case, and the facility that appears to be afforded, either of explanation or contradiction. No person is to be required to explain or contradict, until enough has been proved to warrant a reasonable and just conclusion against him, in the absence of explanation or contradiction; but when such proof has been given, and the nature of the case is such as to admit of explanation or contradiction, if the conclusion to which the proof tends be untrue, and the accused offers no explanation or contradiction; can human reason do otherwise than adopt the conclusion to which the proof tends?
                  
R v Burdett  was relied upon in Reg v Kops 
                  
    [5]
  , a case concerning the effect of legislation in New South Wales which in 1891 
    [6]
   made an accused person a competent but not compellable witness. It was held by a Full Bench with two dissentients that a trial judge may invite the jury to draw inferences adverse to the accused from the fact that, by not giving evidence, the accused has failed to contradict or explain matters upon which incriminating evidence has been given by the prosecution, and which, if untrue, it must be within the power of the accused to contradict or explain. The two judges who dissented (Innes and Stephen JJ.) did so on the basis that a comment of the kind sanctioned by the majority would virtually compel the accused to go into the witness box although the statute said that the accused was not a compellable witness. An appeal to the Privy Council was dismissed with the observation that 
    [7]
  :There may no doubt be cases in which it would not be expedient, or calculated to further the ends of justice, which undoubtedly regards the interests of the prisoner as much as the interests of the Crown, to call attention to the fact that the prisoner has not tendered himself as a witness, it being open to him either to tender himself, or not, as he pleases. But on the other hand there are cases in which it appears to their Lordships that such comments may be both legitimate and necessary.

In Tumahole Bereng v The King 
                  
    [8]
   the Privy Council pointed out that there are limits upon the kind of comment which might properly be made. Their Lordships observed 
    [9]
   that an accused admits nothing by exercising his right to remain silent at his trial. Nevertheless the failure of the accused to give evidence ""may bear against an accused and assist in his conviction if there is other material sufficient to sustain a verdict against him. But if the other material is insufficient either in its quality or extent [the accused's silence] cannot be used as a make-weight.""

In Morgan v Babcock & Wilcox Ltd 
                  
    [10]
   the defendant company was convicted of paying a bribe. At its trial it called no evidence. Upon appeal to this Court, Isaacs J. referred to Blatch v Archer  and said 
    [11]
  :Here the prosecution could not possibly have produced stronger evidence, but it was in the power of the defence to have repelled the inference that arises from the evidence as it stands.  Consequently, since the affirmative evidence in the case raises, to say the least, a strong probability that it was the Company that paid, or caused to be paid, the bribe demanded by Maling, the silence of the Company, and its failure to explain, materially weakens any attempt to suggest in its favour possible hypotheses of innocence.

The same approach is to be found in May v O'Sullivan 
                  
    [12]
  . There the Court said in a well-known passage:Unless there is some special statutory provision on the subject, a ruling that there is a ""case to answer"" has no effect whatever on the onus of proof, which rests on the prosecution from beginning to end. After the prosecution has adduced evidence sufficient to support proof of the issue, the defendant may or may not call evidence. Whether he does or not, the question to be decided in the end by the tribunal is whether, on the whole of the evidence before it, it is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty. This is a question of fact. In deciding this question it may in some cases be legitimate  for it to take into account the fact that the defendant has not given evidence as a consideration making the inference of guilt from the evidence for the prosecution less unsafe than it might otherwise possibly appear: cf. Morgan v Babcock & Wilcox Ltd,  per Isaacs J. 
    [13]
  : But to say this is a very different thing from saying that the onus of proof shifts. A magistrate who has decided that there is a ""case to answer"" may quite consistently, if no evidence is called for the defendant, refuse to convict on the evidence for the prosecution. The prosecution may have made ""a prima facie case"", but it does not follow that in the absence of a ""satisfactory answer"" the defendant should be convicted.
               




                         (1955) 92 C.L.R. 654, at pp. 658-659.


               
The same principle was put in different words by Windeyer J. in Bridge v The Queen  as follows 
    [14]
  :An accused person is never required to prove his innocence: his silence can never displace the onus that is on the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. A failure to offer an explanation does not of itself prove anything. Nor does it, in any strict sense, corroborate other evidence. But the failure of an accused person to contradict on oath evidence that to his knowledge must be true or untrue can logically be regarded as increasing the probability that it is true. That is to say a failure to deny or explain may make evidence more convincing, but it does not supply its deficiencies. A direction by the judge on such matters  might no doubt be helpful to the accused in some cases.
               




                         (1964) 118 C.L.R., at p. 615.


               
We have quoted rather more extensively from the cases than would otherwise be necessary in order to show that it has never really been doubted that when a party to litigation fails to accept an opportunity to place before the court evidence of facts within his or her knowledge which, if they exist at all, would explain or contradict the evidence against that party, the court may more readily accept that evidence. It is not just because uncontradicted evidence is easier or safer to accept than contradicted evidence. That is almost a truism. It is because doubts about the reliability of witnesses or about the inferences to be drawn from the evidence may be more readily discounted in the absence of contradictory evidence from a party who might be expected to give or call it. In particular, in a criminal trial, hypotheses consistent with innocence may cease to be rational or reasonable in the absence of evidence to support them when that evidence, if it exists at all, must be within the knowledge of the accused.
               
Of course, an accused may have reasons not to give evidence other than that the evidence would not assist his or her case. The jury must bear this in mind in determining whether the prosecution case is strengthened by the failure of the accused to give evidence. Ordinarily it is appropriate for the trial judge to warn the jury accordingly.
               
Not every case calls for explanation or contradiction in the form of evidence from the accused. There may be no facts peculiarly within the accused's knowledge. Even if there are facts peculiarly within the accused's knowledge the deficiencies in the prosecution case may be sufficient to account for the accused remaining silent and relying upon the burden of proof cast upon the prosecution. Much depends upon the circumstances of the particular case and a jury should not be invited to take into account the failure of the accused to give evidence unless that failure is clearly capable of assisting them in the evaluation of the evidence before them.
               
The argument in support of the appeal centred very largely on the decision of this Court in Petty v The Queen 
                  
    [15]
  . In that case the Court decided that, at trial, it is not permissible to suggest that an accused's exercise of the right to silence before trial can provide a basis for inferring consciousness of guilt or inferring that a defence raised at trial is a new invention or is otherwise suspect because the accused previously failed to mention it. The decision in Petty v The Queen,  therefore, does not determine the present case where the question is whether it is permissible for the trial judge to instruct the jury that inferences available to be drawn from facts proved by the Crown case can be drawn more safely when the accused elects not to give evidence on relevant facts which the jury perceives to be within his or her knowledge.



                         (1991) 173 C.L.R. 95.


               
However, the appellant argued that, just as it is impermissible for the trial judge to suggest that inferences adverse to the accused may be drawn from a previous exercise of the right to silence, so it is impermissible for the trial judge to suggest that inferences adverse to the accused which are available to be drawn from the facts proved by the Crown may be drawn more safely when the accused does not give evidence of relevant facts which must be within his or her knowledge. We do not agree. There is a distinction, no doubt a fine one, between drawing an inference of guilt merely from silence and drawing an inference otherwise available more safely simply because the accused has not supported any hypothesis which is consistent with innocence from facts which the jury perceives to be within his or her knowledge. In determining whether the prosecution has satisfied the standard of proof to the requisite degree, it is relevant to assess the prosecution case on the footing that the accused has not offered evidence of any hypothesis or explanation which is consistent with innocence.
               
The failure of the accused to give evidence is not of itself evidence. It is not an admission of guilt by conduct. It cannot be, because it is the exercise of a right which the accused has to put the prosecution to its proof. In some other circumstances, silence in the face of an accusation when an answer might reasonably be expected can amount to an admission by conduct 
    [16]
  . But when an accused elects to remain silent at trial, the silence cannot amount to an implied admission. The accused is entitled to take that course and it is not evidence of either guilt or innocence. That is why silence on the part of the accused at his or her trial cannot fill in any gaps in the prosecution case; it cannot be used as a make-weight. It is only when the failure of the accused to give evidence is a circumstance which may bear upon the probative value of the evidence which has been given and which the jury is required to consider, that they may take it into account, and they may take it into account only for the purpose of evaluating that evidence. The fact that the accused's failure to give evidence may have this consequence is something which, no doubt, an accused should consider in determining whether to exercise the right to silence. That was recognized in Reg v Kops . But it is not to deny the right; it is merely to recognize that the jury cannot, and cannot be required to, shut their eyes to the consequences of exercising the right.


See, e.g., Reg v Mitchell (1892), 17 Cox C.C. 503; 
                        Reg v Chandler , [1976] 1 W.L.R. 585; 
                         [1976] 3 All E.R. 105; (1976) 
                         63 Cr. App. R. 1; and the discussion in Young, ""Silence as evidence"", Australian Law Journal, vol. 66 (1992) 675.


               
We think that the trial judge was correct in his view that this was an appropriate case in which to direct the jury as to the manner in which they might take into account the failure of the accused to give evidence. The prosecution case was that the jury should draw from the evidence the inference, not only that Bayerl and Zack were dead, but that they were murdered by the appellant. Clearly those were inferences which were open upon the evidence.
               
Bayerl and Zack disappeared without trace, having last been seen together with the appellant on the boat. Soon after their disappearance the appellant was seen, and held himself out to be, in sole possession of the boat.
               
The circumstances were not consistent with the couple having voluntarily relinquished the boat to the appellant. They had spent a great deal of money on it. They had well-developed plans to use the boat for the purpose of cruising the Pacific. Their possessions, including camping equipment and items of an intimate nature, were still on board the boat when it was discovered in the appellant's possession. If they had left the boat intentionally, it is unlikely that they would have left all of those possessions behind.
               
These facts are not merely evidence calling for an explanation of possession of the Immanuel and its contents. A person using property which belongs to another who recently disappeared may be implicated not only in the theft of the property, but in the disappearance of that other. The inference is open that involvement in the disappearance provided the opportunity for the theft. Clearly that inference was open to the jury in this case.
               
It is true that Bayerl had, in the words of one witness, ""a unique view of what was going on in the world"", a view apparently shared by Zack. He believed that a nuclear holocaust was imminent as the result of a conspiracy involving Catholics and Masons. Consequently the boat was elaborately fitted with equipment including power generators and a water desalinator to enable the couple to live self-sufficiently. Bayerl told friends that he intended to leave Australia without clearing customs so as to elude the conspiracy. He also said on occasions that he intended to live on a Pacific island remote from the holocaust. Whilst it was open to the defence to rely upon these matters, they did not have the result that the other evidence ceased to call for an explanation. In particular, they did not explain how the appellant came to be in possession of the missing couple's personal effects, camping equipment, power generators and water desalinator.
               
The appellant himself claimed to know where Bayerl and Zack were, although he told inconsistent stories about their whereabouts and about the manner in which he came into possession of the boat. It was significant that, notwithstanding the inconsistencies, the appellant never asserted his ignorance of the whereabouts of Bayerl and Zack or of the reason for their absence.
               
The appellant, if anyone, could have explained, not only his possession of the boat, but his possession of the boat in the absence of Bayerl and Zack. His failure to give evidence was, therefore, capable of strengthening the prosecution case by enabling the jury, in the absence of any explanation by him, to accept the inferences for which the prosecution contended as the only rational inferences from the evidence. Indeed, in the circumstances of the present case, it appears to us that a direction of the kind given by the learned trial judge essentially involved no more than a statement of the obvious.
               
Given that a direction of that kind was appropriate, as we think it was, the appellant raises no objection to the form of the direction, that being a form which was approved by the Queensland Court of Criminal Appeal in Reg v Fellowes 
                  
    [17]
  . Nor does the appellant contend in the circumstances of this case that, if a direction was to have been given, it should have included an instruction that reasons may have existed for the appellant's failure to give evidence which would preclude the jury from using that failure in the manner directed by the trial judge.

For these reasons, we think that the only ground of appeal which was argued must fail and that the appeal should be dismissed.
            


               
Brennan and Toohey JJ.
               
The mere refusal by a suspect to answer police questions relating to the commission of an offence or to advance an innocent explanation of the circumstances which throw suspicion upon him affords no basis for an inference of his guilt 
    [18]
  . If the suspect does not exercise his right of silence but chooses to respond selectively to questions asked or allegations made, his conduct (including his refusal to respond to particular questions or allegations) is evidence to which the jury may have regard and from which, according to the circumstances, an inference may be drawn that he has a consciousness of guilt 
    [19]
  . The present case is not concerned with either of these propositions but with another proposition which, though it is classified as one of the categories of the right of silence 
    [20]
  , has a different origin and purpose. The question is whether the jury is entitled to attribute any, and what, significance to the absence of testimony by the accused in a criminal trial. Petty  and Woon  were cases relating to the responses of a suspect to inquiries by police; the present case relates to the non-exercise by an accused of his statutory right to testify in his own defence at his trial. The former cases relate to the responses of a suspect to the performance of an executive function in circumstances where the suspect's rights are not immediately amenable to judicial protection; the present case relates to the course of proceedings directly under judicial control.

In the long history of criminal trials, the present form of the right of an accused to testify in his own defence is of comparatively recent origin. A century ago, the right did not exist in most jurisdictions. Sir James Fitzjames Stephen, writing in 1883, described the procedure of the English criminal trial at that time 
    [21]
  :[A]s matters stand the prisoner is absolutely protected against all judicial questioning before or at the trial, and  he and his wife are prevented from giving evidence in their own behalf. He is often permitted, however, to make any statement he pleases at the very end of the trial, when it is difficult for any one to test the correctness of what is said.The practice of the courts with respect to the questioning of the accused had changed over the preceding centuries. In the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the testimonial incompetence of the accused and his spouse was rested on the notion that interested persons were likely to commit perjury 
    [22]
  . But the rule was vigorously attacked by Jeremy Bentham 
    [23]
   and, at the end of the nineteenth century, the legislature intervened to confer on an accused and his spouse the right to testify on his behalf. It was perceived that self-interest might be an objection to the weight of a witness's evidence but not to the competency of the witness. In Australia, the first legislative intervention was in South Australia: the Accused Persons Evidence Act 1882 
                  SA. The passage of this legislation through the Parliament was attended with much concern that an accused should not be prejudiced if he refrained from exercising his newly bestowed capacity to testify in his own defence

                  Q
                  
    [25]
   made a person accused of an indictable offence and the wife or husband of every accused person a competent but not compellable witness. In 1961, this provision was carried into s. 618A of The Criminal Code. In 1977, s. 8 of the Evidence Act 1977 
                  Q reproduced with some variations the earlier enactments. The provision relevant to the present case is s. 8(1):In a criminal proceeding, each person charged is competent to give evidence on behalf of the defence (whether that person is charged solely or jointly with any other person) but is not compellable to do so.In several jurisdictions, similar statutes preclude the making of any comment by the prosecution 
    [26]
   and, in some instances, by the judge 
    [27]
   on the failure of an accused person to testify. No such provision is to be found in the Queensland statute.

It is readily understandable that a jury would place a guilty complexion on the failure of an accused person to testify if testimony be needed to deny, explain or answer the evidence available to prove guilt. Thus, when Holroyd J. was discussing in R v Burdett 
                  
    [28]
   what we would call today the ""evidentiary onus"", he referred to the effect of the accused's failure to adduce evidence when it is within his power to adduce it:It is established as a general rule of evidence, that in every case the onus probandi lies on the person who wishes to support his case by a particular fact, which lies more peculiarly within his own knowledge, or of which he is supposed to be cognizant. This, indeed, is not allowed to supply the want of necessary proof, whether direct or presumptive, against a defendant of the crime with which he is charged; but when such proof has been given, it is a rule to be applied in considering the weight of the evidence against him, whether direct or presumptive, when it is unopposed, unrebutted, or not weakened by contrary evidence, which it would be in the defendant's power to produce, if the fact directly or presumptively proved were not true.Once juries came to know that an accused is a competent witness in his own defence, it was inevitable that they would take account of an accused's failure to testify when his testimony might be expected to deny, explain or answer the case against him. In Kops v The Queen; Ex parte Kops 
                  
    [29]
   a challenge was made to a summing up in which the judge drew the jury's attention to the accused's right to testify and his failure to exercise it when his testimony might have explained matters naturally within his knowledge and when an explanation would be important in view of the evidence already given. The Privy Council upheld the propriety of the comment, saying:There may no doubt be cases in which it would not be expedient, or calculated to further the ends of justice, which undoubtedly regards the interests of the prisoner as much as the interests of the Crown, to call attention to the fact that the prisoner has not tendered himself as a witness, it being open to him either to tender himself, or not, as he pleases. But on the other hand there are cases in which it appears to their Lordships that such comments may be both legitimate and necessary.

                         [1894] A.C. 650, at p. 653.


               
The judicial discretion to comment, thus affirmed by the Privy Council, led the New South Wales legislature to enact a prohibition on any comment on an accused person's failure to give evidence. The prohibition was a legislative attempt to ensure that no adverse inference should arise from the failure by an accused to exercise his statutory right to testify, as Isaacs J. explained in Bataillard v The King 
                  
    [30]
  :A new opportunity had been afforded to a prisoner to establish his innocence if he could. But reasons other than a sense of guilt, such as timidity, weakness, a dread of confusion or of cross-examination, or even the knowledge of a previous conviction, certainly in a summary proceeding, and perhaps in the case of a trial for an indictable offence, might easily prevent the accused person from availing himself of the new means permitted by law. Hence the legislature determined to prevent the enactment, if not used by the prisoner, from being employed as a means of inculpation.It is questionable whether, now that juries generally know that an accused has a right to testify, it is still conducive to the administration of criminal justice to prevent the judge from directing the jury about the limits of the use which they can make of an accused's failure to testify. However that may be, the Queensland legislation leaves a judge free in an appropriate case to comment on an accused's failure to give evidence.



                         (1907) 4 C.L.R. 1282, at pp. 1290-1291.


               
Counsel for the appellant submitted that any direction which takes as its starting point an accused's decision not to give evidence infringes the right of silence but that submission is inconsistent with the judgment of the Privy Council in Kops.  Windeyer J. pointed out in Bridge v The Queen 
                  
    [31]
   that Kops  has ""remained the generally accepted expression of the law when comment by the judge on the failure of an accused person to give evidence is not expressly forbidden""
                  
    [32]
  . However, as his Honour noted 
    [33]
  , the courts have had to face the problem of reconciling ""the traditional repugnance aroused by any form of compulsory self-incrimination with the adverse inferences that insistently arise from a failure to answer a charge"". His Honour stated the limits of the use to which the accused's failure to testify can be put 
    [34]
  :An accused person is never required to prove his innocence: his silence can never displace the onus that is on the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. A failure to offer an explanation does not of itself prove anything. Nor does it, in any strict sense, corroborate other evidence. But the failure of an accused person to contradict on oath evidence that to his knowledge must be true or untrue can logically be regarded as increasing the probability that it is true. That is to say a failure to deny or explain may make evidence more convincing, but it does not supply its deficiencies.It is important that a trial judge should ensure, especially if any comment is made on an accused's decision not to give evidence, that juries do not use impermissibly the failure to testify. At the least, the jury must be told that the accused is not bound to give evidence and that the onus remains on the prosecution to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt 
    [35]
  . The limited use which can be made of an accused's failure to testify is of special importance when the prosecution case depends upon the drawing of an inference of guilt from the facts proved directly by evidence. In such a case, the jury must not use a failure to testify as a fact, albeit in conjunction with other facts, from which they might infer the accused's guilt 
    [36]
  . If there is insufficient evidence of the facts from which an inference of guilt could be drawn, a failure to testify cannot supply the deficiency. But the jury may draw inferences adverse to the accused more readily by considering that the accused, being in a position to deny, explain or answer the evidence against him, has failed to do so. In Wilson v Buttery 
                  
    [37]
  , Napier J. said:If the truth is not easily ascertainable by the prosecution, but is probably well known to the defendant, then the fact that no explanation or answer is forthcoming as might be expected if the truth were consistent with innocence, is a matter which the Court or jury may properly consider.Citing this passage in Morgan v Babcock & Wilcox Ltd 
                  
    [38]
  , Isaacs J. held that, as the affirmative evidence in the case raised ""a strong probability"" that it was the defendant Company that had paid, or had caused to be paid, the bribe the subject of the charge in that case, ""the silence of the Company, and its failure to explain, materially weakens any attempt to suggest in its favour possible hypotheses of innocence"". In May v O'Sullivan  this Court said 
    [39]
  :After the prosecution has adduced evidence sufficient to support proof of the issue, the defendant may or may not call evidence. Whether he does or not, the question to be decided in the end by the tribunal is whether, on the whole of the evidence before it, it is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty. This is a question of fact. In deciding this question it may in some cases be legitimate, as is pointed out in Wilson v Buttery, for it to take into account the fact that the defendant has not given evidence as a consideration making the inference of guilt from the evidence for the prosecution less unsafe than it might otherwise possibly appear: cf. Morgan v Babcock & Wilcox,  per Isaacs J. 
    [38]
  . But to say this is a very different thing from saying that the onus of proof shifts.

It follows that, in Queensland and in other jurisdictions where there is no statutory prohibition against judicial comment, a judge may tell the jury that where the facts which they find to be proved by the evidence can support an inference that the accused committed the offence charged and where it is reasonable to expect that, if the truth were consistent with innocence, a denial, explanation or answer would be forthcoming, the jury may take the accused's failure to give evidence into account in determining whether the inference should be drawn. The jury should be told that the onus remains on the prosecution and that the accused is under no obligation to give evidence, but that ""it is legitimate to have regard to the fact that the accused has given no evidence or explanation or satisfactory explanation of the Crown case as a consideration making the inference of guilt from the evidence for the prosecution less unsafe than it might otherwise possibly appear""

Reg v Guiren (1962), 79 W.N. NSW 811, at p. 813.


               
Moynihan J., in directing the jury on the trial of the appellant for the murder of two people who disappeared in circumstances from which an inference of guilt might have been drawn, said:As has already been said to you, the Crown bears the onus of satisfying you beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of the offences with which he is charged. The accused bears no onus. He does not have to prove anything. For that reason he was under no obligation to give evidence. You cannot infer guilt simply from his failure to do so. The consequence of that failure is this: you have no evidence from the accused to add to, or explain, or to vary, or contradict the evidence put before you by the prosecution.No objection is taken to this direction, but objection is taken to the passage which followed and which related to the use which the jury could make of the absence of the appellant's evidence in the drawing of an inference of guilt:Moreover, this is a case in which the truth is not easily, you might think, ascertainable by the prosecution. It asks you to infer guilt from a whole collection of circumstances. It asks you to draw inferences from such facts as it is able to prove. Such an inference may be more safely drawn from the proven facts when an accused person elects not to give evidence of relevant facts which it can easily be perceived must be within his knowledge. You might, for example, think in this case it requires no great perception that the accused would have direct knowledge of events which can be canvassed only obliquely from the point of view of seeking to have you draw an inference from the evidence which has been led by the Crown. The use that you make of the fact that there is no evidence given or called by the defendant in these proceedings is that.Later in his summing up, his Honour directed the jury as follows:I remind you that the onus is on the prosecution and the fact that the accused has not given or called evidence proves nothing. I remind you that the consequence of that circumstance is that you have no evidence from the accused to explain the evidence put before you by the prosecution, and that moreover, this is a case where the truth is not easily ascertainable by the prosecution. You remember rather here it seeks to have you infer guilt from such facts as it is able to prove to your satisfaction. Such an inference may be more safely drawn from the proven facts when the accused elects not to give evidence of relevant facts which can be easily perceived to be in his knowledge.No error appears in these directions. The onus of proof is correctly placed on the prosecution. The facts from which an inference of guilt may be drawn are correctly identified as facts which the prosecution is able to prove. The use to which the appellant's failure to give evidence may be put is correctly restricted to the strengthening of an inference of guilt from the facts proved. And the jury is told not to use the appellant's failure to give evidence unless relevant facts ""can be easily perceived to be in his knowledge"". This additional requirement, which follows a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal of Queensland in Reg v Whinfield 
                  
    [41]
  , ensures that the drawing of an inference of guilt will not be assisted by an accused's failure to give evidence unless it is reasonable to expect some denial, explanation or answer by the accused to the prima facie case made against him.


Unreported; 16 September 1986; p. 25.


               
In the present case, the appellant's several claims to knowledge of the whereabouts or plans of Bayerl and Zack, his possession of their vessel and of their personal possessions and his account of that possession called for an explanation. None was forthcoming. These facts, combined with the long and inexplicable disappearance of Bayerl and Zack and the apparent prevarication of the appellant when explanations had been sought from him, raised a strong prima facie case against him. There was no misdirection by the trial judge. The jury, acting in accordance with that direction, was entitled to convict the appellant of the murder of Bayerl and Zack. The appeal should be dismissed.
            


               
Gaudron and McHugh JJ.
               
Johann Manfred Weissensteiner (""the appellant"") was convicted in the Supreme Court of Queensland of murdering Susan Zack and Hartwig Bayerl at Cairns between 1 November 1989 and 18 January 1990. He was also convicted of stealing a 36-foot cutter at Cairns on 17 January 1990. That vessel, the Immanuel, belonged or had belonged to Mr. Bayerl. An appeal to the Court of Appeal against those convictions was unsuccessful (Pincus and McPherson JJ.A., Shepherdson J. dissenting). The appellant now appeals to this Court.
               
Ms. Zack, an English woman, and Mr. Bayerl, an Austrian, were engaged to be married. It seems that they lived on board the Immanuel in Cairns Harbour until the end of November 1989. They were seen by various people in and around Cairns during November. Ms. Zack, who was in the early stages of pregnancy, visited her doctor on 24 November and, it seems, made a small purchase with a credit card on 27 November. Mr. Bayerl telephoned his mother in Austria on or about 26 November. Nothing has been heard of or from them since that time or, at the latest, since early December. In particular, neither has since communicated with his or her parents, although both were previously in regular contact with them.
               
The appellant was well acquainted with Mr. Bayerl and Ms. Zack. He worked on the Immanuel with them for several months in the last half of 1989, preparing the boat for a voyage that Ms. Zack and Mr. Bayerl intended to make in the Pacific Ocean. It may be that the appellant was to accompany them on that voyage.
               
Very early in January 1990, Ms. Zack's parents, who live in England, tried to contact her to let her know of her aunt's death. They eventually made contact with the port officer at Cairns, Mr. Nucifora. On 4 January, he inquired of the appellant as to Ms. Zack's whereabouts and was told that she and the owner of the boat were ""over in the Tablelands"" (presumably, the Atherton Tablelands in the Cairns hinterland) and would be back the following week. The appellant undertook to get a note to her.
               
The account given by the appellant to Mr. Nucifora was slightly different from that given to an immigration officer at Cairns the day before. On 3 January 1990, in the course of informing an immigration officer of a return voyage he intended to make to New Guinea, the appellant said that the owner of the Immanuel was visiting friends in Kuranda and would rejoin the yacht in Cairns at the end of the month. Later, on 16 January 1990, he told a customs official, Mr. Golding, that he was to meet the owner of the boat in Port Moresby.
               
The Immanuel was moved from its usual mooring to a more remote one sometime in December 1989. It left Cairns Harbour on about 17 January 1990, a customs clearance having been issued the day before. Thereafter, the appellant and the boat were seen in different places in the Pacific and were finally intercepted in the Marshall Islands. Various personal items belonging to Ms. Zack and Mr. Bayerl were found on board.
               
When interviewed in Majuro in the Marshall Islands, the appellant indicated that his earlier statement to the port officer in Cairns to the effect that Ms. Zack was on the Tablelands was a lie. Instead, he said that she and Mr. Bayerl had left Cairns with a small pack saying that they were going to Western Australia. He gave other accounts on other occasions: he told a Mr. Dujmovic in Majuro that he had dropped the couple off at Bougainville; in Kiribati he told a customs official that they were in Cairns; he also told a police officer in Kiribati that they were in Kununurra.
               
In the course of his directions to the jury, the trial judge, Moynihan J., instructed them that the accused bore no onus to prove anything, was not obliged to give evidence and no inference of guilt could be drawn from his failure to do so. However, his Honour went on to point out there was no evidence from him ""to add to, or explain, or to vary, or contradict the evidence put before you by the prosecution"" and then said:Moreover, this is a case in which the truth is not easily, you might think, ascertainable by the prosecution. It asks you to infer guilt from a whole collection of circumstances. It asks you to draw inferences from such facts as it is able to prove. Such an inference may be more safely drawn from the proven facts when an accused person elects not to give evidence of relevant facts which it can easily be perceived must be within his knowledge. You might, for example, think in this case it requires no great perception that the accused would have direct knowledge of events which can be canvassed only obliquely from the point of view of seeking to have you draw an inference from the evidence which has been led by the Crown. The use that you make of the fact that there is no evidence given or called by the defendant is that.Later, his Honour returned to the fact that there was no evidence from the appellant, saying:I remind you that the consequence of that circumstance is that you have no evidence from the accused to explain the evidence put before you by the prosecution, and that moreover, this is a case where the truth is not easily ascertainable by the prosecution. You remember rather here it seeks to have you infer guilt from such facts as it is able to prove to your satisfaction. Such an inference may be more safely drawn from the proven facts when the accused elects not to give evidence of relevant facts which can be easily perceived to be in his knowledge.The issue in this appeal is whether those directions were correct.
               
The argument for the appellant was made by reference to the right to silence and the recent decision of this Court in Petty v The Queen 
                  
    [42]
  . It was said in that case that an incident of the right to silence, which is a fundamental rule of the common law, is that ""no adverse inference can be drawn against an accused person by reason of his or her failure to answer questions or to provide  information""
                  
    [43]
   when questioned as to the occurrence of an offence 
    [44]
  . It was argued on behalf of the appellant that, as there is no obligation on an accused person to give evidence, the same must be true of his or her failure to do so. And, it was said, a statement that an inference of guilt might more easily be drawn because the accused did not give evidence is, in effect, an invitation to the jury to draw an inference adverse to the accused by reason of that fact.



                         (1991) 173 C.L.R. 95.

                         ibid., at p. 99, per Mason C.J., Deane, Toohey and McHugh JJ. Note the possible qualification of the right to silence for the offence of misprision of felony.
See also,  ibid., at pp. 106-107, per Brennan J.; p. 129, per Gaudron J.; cf. pp. 120-121, per Dawson J.


               
The prosecution countered the submissions for the appellant by arguing that it has long been accepted that if, as in Queensland, there is no statutory prohibition on judicial comment as to the accused's failure to give evidence 
    [45]
  , it is permissible, in certain cases, to direct the jury along the lines involved in this case. It was put that the cases in which such a direction may be given are exemplified by those in which innocent explanation, if there is one, is something peculiarly within the knowledge of the accused. And, it was said, this was such a case.


Nor is there any statutory prohibition on comment by the prosecution. In New South Wales, the Northern Territory and Victoria legislation prohibits comment by the judge or the prosecution upon the accused's failure to testify: Crimes Act 1900 
                        NSW, s. 407(2); Evidence Act 1939 
                        NT, s. 9(3); Crimes Act 1958 
                        Vic, s. 399(3). In Western Australia, Tasmania, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory legislation prohibits comment by the prosecution only: Evidence Act 1906 
                        WA, s. 8(1)(c); Evidence Act 1910 
                        Tas, s. 85(1)(c); Evidence Act 1929 
                        SA, s. 18(1)II; Evidence Act 1971 
                        ACT, s. 74(1).


               
Certainly, there is long standing authority to the effect that it is permissible, in some cases, to comment on the failure of an accused to give evidence. Thus it was said by the Privy Council in Kops v The Queen 
                  
    [46]
  :There may no doubt be cases in which it would not be expedient, or calculated to further the ends of justice, which undoubtedly regards the interests of the prisoner as much as the interests of the Crown, to call attention to the fact that the prisoner has not tendered himself as a witness, it being open to him either to tender himself, or not, as he pleases. But on the other hand there are cases in which it appears to their Lordships that such comments may be both legitimate and necessary.
               




                         [1894] A.C. 650, at p. 653.


               
There are many other authoritative statements to the same effect as Kops 
                  
    [47]
  . Not all of them are confined to the failure of an accused person to give evidence at trial. However, many have that focus and, thus, it should be noted that, if failure to give evidence has any significance at all, it can only be in very limited circumstances. That is because regard must always be had to the presumption of innocence and the duty of the prosecution to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. In the light of those considerations, if failure to give evidence has significance, it can only be because it is reasonable, given the circumstances of the case, to expect that an innocent person would offer an explanation of the events in question and an explanation has not been advanced in some other way, either before or during the trial.

That it is the failure to explain, and not the failure to give evidence as such, that the authorities allow to be taken into account in appropriate circumstances clearly appears from a passage in Wilson v Buttery 
                  
    [48]
   which was approved by this Court in May v O'Sullivan 
                  
    [49]
  . It was said in Wilson v Buttery  that:If the truth is not easily ascertainable by the prosecution, but is probably well known to the defendant, then the fact that no explanation or answer is forthcoming as might be expected if the truth were consistent with innocence, is a matter which the Court or jury may properly consider.

Not surprisingly, the cases which focus on the failure of an accused to give evidence, rather than the failure to explain, do not always provide clear guidance as to the circumstances in which that failure becomes significant 
    [50]
  . However, some indication appears from R v Burdett 
                  
    [51]
  , where it was said:But when one or more things are proved, from which our experience enables us to ascertain that another, not proved, must have happened, we presume that it did happen, as well in criminal as in civil cases.  It is enough, if its existence be highly probable, particularly if the opposite party has it in his power to rebut it by evidence, and yet offers none; for then we have something like an admission that the presumption is just.
               



See, e.g., Sparrow , [1973] 1 W.L.R., at p. 496; 
                         [1973] 2 All E.R., at p. 136; (1973) 
                         57 Cr. App. R., at p. 363, per Lawton L.J., where it was said that ""[w]hat is said must depend upon the facts of each case and in some cases the interests of justice call for a stronger comment. The trial judge, who has the feel of the case, is the person who must exercise his discretion in this matter to ensure that a trial is fair. A discretion is not to be fettered by laying down rules and regulations for its exercise"". This is cited with approval in Gallagher , [1974] 1 W.L.R., at p. 1211; 
                         [1974] 3 All E.R., at p. 125; (1974) 
                         59 Cr. App. R., at p. 245. See, to the same effect, Reg v Rhodes , [1899] 1 Q.B., at p. 83, per Lord Russell of Killowen C.J. See also Haw Tua Tau v Public Prosecutor , [1982] A.C. 136, at p. 153, where it was said that the inferences to be drawn from a refusal to give evidence ""depend upon the circumstances of the particular case, and is a question to be decided by applying ordinary commonsense"".

                         (1820) 4 B. & Ald. 95, at pp. 121-122; [ 106 E.R. 873, at p. 883].


               
The first part of the passage quoted from Burdett  is concerned with what is commonly called a ""presumption of fact"". That expression is apt to confuse because it may be used to convey two quite different things. It may be used to refer to a fact which is inferred from other facts, particularly if it is an inference which is commonly drawn 
    [52]
  . It is in this sense that the word ""presumption"" is used in the passage quoted 
    [53]
  . On the other hand, it may be used to refer to an assumption which, in the absence of evidence one way or another, may and usually will be made by reason of commonsense or common experience. Such assumptions are sometimes called ""evidentiary presumptions""
                  
    [54]
  . A presumption, in this second sense, is involved in the observation in Burdett  that there is ""something like an admission"" in the failure to lead rebutting evidence, although that does not clearly appear. It is a conjunction of presumptions, in each of the different senses indicated, which may, in certain cases, give significance to the failure of an accused person to offer an explanation of facts established by the prosecution case. For ease of expression and to avoid confusion, we refer hereafter to inferences and assumptions rather than presumptions.


Note that it is used in this sense in Cross on Evidence, 4th Aust. ed. (1991), par. 7215. Its use in this sense is criticised in Phipson on Evidence, 14th ed. (1990), par. 5-02.
It is also used in this sense in Fitzpatrick v Walter E Cooper Pty Ltd (1935), 54 C.L.R. 200, at p. 219, per Dixon J. and in Watts v Rake (1960), 108 C.L.R. 158, at p. 159, per Dixon C.J.
See, e.g., Reg v Falconer (1990), 171 C.L.R. 30, at p. 83, as to the assumed fact or the evidentiary presumption that an apparently conscious person acts voluntarily.


               
Some facts, of which recent possession of stolen goods is a familiar example 
    [55]
  , so obviously suggest a particular state of affairs that they give rise to an inference to that effect and also give rise to an assumption that an innocent person faced with those facts would offer some explanation of them. If no explanation is offered, the conclusion is that there is only one explanation and it is the one suggested by the objective facts.


See Reg v Raviraj (1987), 85 Cr. App. R. 93, at p. 103, where it is said that the so-called ""doctrine of recent possession"" is: ""only a particular aspect of the general proposition that where suspicious circumstances appear to demand an explanation, and no explanation or an entirely incredible explanation is given, the lack of explanation may warrant an inference of guilty knowledge in the defendant. This again is only part of a wider proposition that guilt may be inferred from unreasonable behaviour of a defendant when confronted with facts which seem to accuse.""
                     


               
The circumstances which so obviously suggest a particular conclusion that they call for an explanation, if there is one consistent with innocence, are not susceptible of definition. Nor can they be identified with particularity. However, they are confined by the presumption of innocence and the duty of the prosecution to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. In general terms, they fall into two broad categories. There are those, such as recent possession of stolen goods, where the objective facts give rise to an inference (in the sense of suggesting one and only one explanation) that the accused committed or was a party to the commission of the offence charged. Generally, cases in this category involve facts which are such that it can be said that the accused was ""caught practically redhanded""
                  
    [56]
   as, for example, if found at the scene of a murder and in possession of the murder weapon. On the other hand, there are those which suggest that the accused is possessed of some special knowledge in the sense that he or she, above all others, knows something of the offence charged or something bearing on it 
    [57]
  . For example, it may be established that the accused is the owner of the murder weapon, in which event there is an inference that the accused knows how the weapon left his or her possession, if, in fact, it did so and it is assumed that an innocent person would account for its not being in his or her possession at the relevant time 
    [58]
  . The critical factor in cases of both kinds is that the facts are such as to give validity to the assumption that an innocent person would offer an explanation. Thus, it is sometimes said that the circumstances must be such that failure to explain is inconsistent with innocence 
    [59]

                        Reg v Guiren (1962), 79 W.N. NSW, at p. 813: cf. Anderson v Geerlings (1988), 6 M.V.R. 392, at p. 397, where there was an ""equally consistent and rational explanation of the facts"" and an inference could not be drawn because ""to convict, the facts must be only consistent with the accused's guilt.""
                     


               
It was argued for the appellant that the authorities which allow for judicial comment to be made as to the failure of an accused person to explain, even in the limited circumstances described, are inconsistent with the right to silence as explained in Petty v The Queen.  And it was put that, on that account, they should no longer be followed. However, there is a difference between mere silence or the absence of evidence, on the one hand, and, on the other, the failure to explain facts for which, it is assumed, an innocent person would offer some explanation. Where there is an assumption to that effect, the failure to explain is conduct which proves or tends to prove guilty knowledge on the part of the accused 
    [60]
   and is, itself, evidence.


See Bruce v The Queen (1987), 61 A.L.J.R. 603; 
                         74 A.L.R. 219; 
                        Reg v Hallocoglu (1992), 29 N.S.W.L.R. 67, at p. 78, where it was said: ""The inference is that he did not [attempt to explain what had happened] because there was no acceptable explanation to be given.""
                     


               
The right to silence is, of course, concerned with more than the presumption of innocence and the duty of the prosecution to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. However, it is the presumption of innocence and the prosecution's burden of proof which preclude an adverse inference being drawn from silence which does not amount to evidence or, as we have called it, ""mere silence"". Because of the presumption and because of the burden of proof, silence of that kind proves nothing and provides no basis for any inference adverse to the accused. But neither the presumption of innocence nor the burden of proof bears upon the situation in which failure to explain is, itself, evidence. Nor does the privilege against incrimination: in circumstances involving an assumption that an innocent person would offer an explanation, the accused is not asked to testify against himself, but in favour of himself 
    [61]
  .


Andrew Bruce comments to this effect in ""The right to comment on the failure of the defendant to testify"", Michigan Law Review, vol. 31 (1932) 226,  at p. 233. Note also the observation in Reg v Chandler , [1976] 1 W.L.R. 585, at p. 589; 
                         [1976] 3 All E.R. 105, at p. 109; (1976) 
                         63 Cr. App. R. 1, at p. 4, per Lawton L.J. that: ""The law has long accepted that an accused person is not bound to incriminate himself; but it does not follow that a failure to answer an accusation or question when an answer could reasonably be expected may not provide some evidence in support of an accusation.""
                     


               
Given that failure to explain can amount to evidence, albeit in limited circumstances, there is no basis for departing from the authorities which acknowledge that, in those limited circumstances, it is appropriate to comment on the fact that particular evidence is unexplained or unanswered.
               
In the context of the right to silence, it is important to bear in mind that it is the failure to provide an ""explanation or answer  as might be expected if the truth were consistent with innocence""
                  
    [62]
   which is of evidentiary significance and not the failure to give evidence as such. In many cases, an explanation can be offered without the giving of evidence: it may, for example, be advanced when the person concerned is first confronted with the facts or it may be advanced in the course of the trial without evidence from the accused. Moreover, the assumption that an innocent person would offer an explanation loses all relevance if there has not been a real opportunity to explain. An opportunity of that kind, as was made clear in Bruce v The Queen , does not encompass the situation in which the ""accused, having been duly cautioned, declines to answer questions by the police in the exercise of his right to do so""
                  
    [63]
  . Accordingly, directions should be given in terms of the unexplained facts, rather than in terms of the failure to give evidence or to meet the prosecution case generally or the failure to answer questions from investigating police 
    [64]
  . And to avoid any possibility of the jury giving significance to the accused's silence with respect to other matters, a direction, if one is to be given, should be precisely framed in terms of the particular facts which call for explanation in the sense indicated.


Wilson v Buttery, [1926] S.A.S.R.,  at p. 154.
                     

                         (1987) 61 A.L.J.R., at p. 603; 
                         74 A.L.R., at p. 219. Note that it was also there said that ""the fact that the caution was given or that the right to silence was asserted or exercised does not itself provide an explanation"" for the facts involved. See also Petty v The Queen (1991), 173 C.L.R., at p. 127, per Gaudron J.
See Bruce v The Queen (1987), 61 A.L.J.R., at p. 604; 
                         74 A.L.R., at p. 220.


               
One other matter should be remembered with respect to the right to silence and its application in cases involving circumstances which call for an explanation in the sense indicated. If an explanation is offered, the question for the jury is whether that explanation is to be accepted as a reasonable possibility. If it is not, it is, in effect, no explanation at all 
    [65]
  . The fact that an explanation is advanced some time after a real opportunity to explain first presents itself may bear on whether it is to be accepted as a reasonable possibility. If an explanation is offered, the right to silence is not infringed merely by pointing out that the explanation was not given when a real opportunity first presented itself for, as already indicated, that ultimately goes to the question whether the facts are or are not explained 
    [66]
  .


See, e.g., R v Aves , [1950] 2 All E.R. 330; 
                        Loughlin (1951), 35 Cr. App. R. 69; 
                        Raviraj (1987), 85 Cr. App. R., at p. 103 and Trainer v The King (1906), 4 C.L.R. 126, at pp. 133-134, 138-139, where the failure to provide an acceptable explanation is treated as having the same significance as failure to provide an explanation at all.
See Petty v The Queen (1991), 173 C.L.R., at pp. 118-119, per Dawson J.; pp. 125-127, per Gaudron J.; see also pp. 104-105, per Brennan J.


               
So far as the present case is concerned, the facts clearly suggest that the appellant, above all others, knew how he came to be in possession of the Immanuel with the personal belongings of Ms. Zack and Mr. Bayerl on board. And, since they have apparently disappeared, those facts provide ample foundation for an assumption that an innocent person would offer some explanation of that possession. Unexplained possession of the Immanuel was, in the circumstances, evidence which proved or tended to prove guilty knowledge with respect to that possession.
               
Moreover, only the appellant could know why he had given different accounts on different occasions as to the whereabouts of Ms. Zack and Mr. Bayerl. Without some explanation of his actions in that regard, the jury might well conclude that that was because he had something to conceal concerning the circumstances of their disappearance. And that was a matter the jury could take into account in relation to the offences charged if and to the extent it was satisfied that those actions were inconsistent with his innocence of them 
    [67]
  . But beyond that, there is nothing in the evidence to provide the basis for an assumption that the appellant had some special knowledge as to the whereabouts of Ms. Zack and Mr. Bayerl, as might be suggested if, for example, it had been established that they sailed with him from Cairns. Much less can it be said that the facts so obviously implicate him in murdering them that they call for an explanation in the sense discussed.


See Woon v The Queen (1964), 109 C.L.R. 529, at pp. 541-542, per Windeyer J. where his Honour explains that ""the inference which can be drawn from conduct and demeanour that displays a consciousness of guilt may depend upon whether there is other evidence pointing to the accused as guilty of the offence charged. When there is, false accounts of movements, false denials of knowledge of relevant facts, any conduct, utterance or demeanour demonstrative of guilt may go far to support a conclusion that the accused committed the very crime charged. But when there is no other evidence implicating the accused, an attitude of guilt, without more, may mean only that the accused was a participant in some wrongdoing, not that he committed the crime alleged, in manner and form alleged.""
                     


               
The directions to the jury were defective in two important respects. They were couched in terms of the failure to give evidence, rather than in terms of the unexplained facts. And they were not confined to the appellant's unexplained possession of the Immanuel in the absence of Ms. Zack and Mr. Bayerl and his failure to explain the different accounts given by him on different occasions as to the whereabouts of Ms. Zack and Mr. Bayerl. Rather, they suggested that the appellant's failure to give evidence in relation to some matters entitled the jury to more readily draw an inference of guilt from the whole of the Crown case. As already indicated, neither his failure to give evidence nor his failure to explain the disappearance of Ms. Zack and Mr. Bayerl was a matter that could properly be taken into account on any of the charges.
               
So far as the directions to the jury permitted them to have regard to the failure of the appellant to give evidence they clearly constitute a serious miscarriage of justice which requires the convictions for murder to be set aside. They also constitute a serious miscarriage of justice with respect to the charge of stealing the Immanuel, notwithstanding that the appellant's unexplained possession of the boat was a matter to which the jury could have regard in reaching a verdict on that particular charge. Although the case on the charge of stealing may be described as a strong one, the verdict was not inevitable. Given the terms of the directions, the jury may well have proceeded on the basis that the appellant's failure to give evidence with respect to the whereabouts of Ms. Zack and Mr. Bayerl was a matter which could be taken into account in reaching a verdict on that charge. Accordingly, all three convictions must be quashed.
               
The appeal should be allowed. The judgment and order of the Court of Criminal Appeal should be set aside and in lieu thereof it should be ordered that the appeal to that court be allowed, the convictions quashed and a new trial ordered on all charges.",1993-11-17 00:00:00,High Court of Australia

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 

BLACK  CJ: 

These  appeals  concern  the  validity  of  three  search  warrants  issued  under  s.lO(1)  of  the 

Crinies Act  1914.  The form of  the warrants and  the  issues on the appeal appear from the 

joint  reasons  for  judgment  of  Lockhart,  Beaumont  and  Hill  JJ,  which  I  have  had  the 

advantage of reading.  Section lO(1) is also set out in the joint judgment. 

I agree with  Lockhart,  Beaumont and  H111 JJ,  for the reasons  they  give, that the terms  in 

which  the warrants describe the  suspected offences do not  invalidate the warrants and  that 

there  is  no  substance  in  the  appellants'  further  contention  that,  by  reason  of  non- 

disclosure,  misrepresentation  or  lack  of  good  faith,  the  warrants  were  improperly 

obtained. 

I also agree that a warrant  issued  under  S. lO(1)  may contain a provision that  Identifies the 

objects of  the  search by  reference,  amongst other things,  to  a description that  reflects the 

language of  s.lO(l)(b).  The  third  condition  in  each  of  the  present  warrants  effectively 

limits their scope to things that were,  as a matter of  objective fact at the time the warrant 

was  issued,  things  as  to  which  there  were  reasonable  grounds  for  believ~ng that  they 

would  afford  evidence as  to  the  commission of  one  or  more  of  the  offences described. 

The warrants  are not  general warrants at all;  in fact they  are very  specific.  In my  view, 

however,  there  nevertheless  remains  a  question  whether,  without  additional  words  of 

limitation,  the  third  condition  sufficiently  llrnlts  the  warrants  so  that  their  issue  was 

authorised by  S. lO(1).
--------
It is  of  course well  established that  strlct compl~ance wlth  the statutory conditions for 

the issue  of  a  search warrant is required.  As  the Hlgh  Court pointed  out in  Geoige v. 

Rockett  (1990)  170 CLR  104 at  111, to  insist  on  strict  compliance  1s  slmply  to  give 

effect to the purpose of  the legislation. See also  Coco v.  The  Queetz  (1994) 68 AWR 

401. 

One of  the essential conditions for the Issue of  a  search  warrant  under s.lO(1)  1s  that 

the required  satisfaction  of  the justice  of  the peace  or  magistrate  be  ""by information 

on  oath"": see Geoee v. Rockett,  esp.  at  113-115, 122.  In  the present  case  the issuing 

justice  recited  in  the warrants  her  satisfaction  ""by  information  on  oath  placed  before 

[her]"". The Information  on  oath put before the justice  did  not  however  purport to be, 

and  could  not be sald  to be,  the totality  of  all  the  inforniation  upon  which  a  person 

might,  as  an  objective  matter,  be  satisfied  that  there  were  the  requlred  reasonable 

grounds for suspecting and reasonable grounds for believing.  Indeed  it is not hard  to 

imagine how there could  be other information, not put before the justice  on oath, that 

as  a  matter  of  objectlve  fact  could  provlde  reasonable  grounds  tor  believing  that 

particular  documents would  afford  evldence  as to the  commission  of  one  or  more  of 

the described offences. 

The third  condit~on of  the warrants  is  conceded  to  be  of  critlcnl  Importance  because 

wthout it the warrants would be too wide.  To my  mind,  however,  the thlrd  condition 

fails in  one  cntlcal  respect  to  limit  sutficiently the  scope of  the warrants.  It  fails,  in 

my  view,  because  the  third  condition  may  be  satisfied  according  to  its  terms  if,  as  a
--------
matter  of  objective  fact,  however  esrablirlzeci, it  can  be  said  of  a  particular  thing  in 

respect  of  which  the  first  two  conditions  are  satisfied,  that  there  are  reasonable 

grounds for believing that it will afford evidence as the commiss~on of  one or more of 

the offences described in the warrant. 

In  my  opinion  the  third  condition  does  not 

limit the  information  by  which  reasonable grounds  can be shown  to  emst  as  a  matter 

of  objective  fact  to  the  information  on  oath  placed  before  the  magistrate.  Thus  a 

police  officer executing any of  the warrants  could justify,  according to the terms of  the 

warrant,  the  seizure  of  particular  documents  by  reference  to  additional  facts  In 

existence  at  the  time  the  warrant  was  Issued  but,  for  whatever  reason,  not  placed 

before the justice  of  the peace on oath when  the warrant was being sought. 

I  would  therefore  hold  that  the warrants  are not  authonsed  by  s.lO(1)  because,  as I 

would  construe them,  each goes further  than to authorise the seizure of  a  thing  as to 

which  a  justice  was  satisfied  exclus~vely by  i?2forntotio?z o?z  ontlz  that  there  was  the 

required  reasonable  ground  for  suspectmg  and  the  requlred  reasonable  grounds  for 

beliewng.  It  is  of  course  qulte possible  that  the inforniatlon  prov~ded to a justice  on 

oath  wll  support  a  variety  of  reasonable  grounds  for  suspectmg  and  believing  and 

these grounds  need  not  themselves  be  stated  in  anythlng put before  the justice  or in 

the  warrant  itself,  but  what  are  reasonable  grounds  still  has  to  be  decided  by 

reference  to the information on oath placed before the justlce. 

The  insistence,  that  the  law  requires,  on  strict  compl~ance with  strlctly  construed 

statutory  cond~tions for  the  issue  of  a  search  warrant  operates  in  a  case  such  as the
--------
present to maintain  an important safeguard to the rights of  Individuals whose interests 

might  be invaded,  namely  the  requirement  imposed  by  the  Parl~ament in  s.lO(1)  that 

the information upon wh~ch a warrant is issued be on oath:  see  George v. Rockeft  esp 
at 113 - 115. 

I  would  therefore  allow  the  appeals  and  set  aside  the  orders  d~srnissing the 

applications  for  jud~cial revlew. 

I  would  declare  that  the  dec~sions to  Issue  the 

warrants were not authorised  by  s.10  of  the Critnes Acr  1914 and that the warrants are 

of  no  effect.  I  would  order  the  third  and  fourth  respondents  to pay  the  appellants' 

costs. 

I  cert~fy that  thls  and the preceding  4 
pages  are a  true  copy of  the Reasons 
for 
of 
the 
Ilonourable Ch~ef Justlce Black.

THE FORM OF THE WARRANTS 

The warrants  purport  to  authorise named members  of 

the Australian Federal Police to  enter  several premises  said 

to  be  the  premises  of  the  appellants,  Peter  Eric  Dunesky 

(""Dunesky"") and Bay Wool Pty. Ltd.  ( ""Bay Wool"")  and of Edney 

Lawrence &  Co.  (""Edney Lawrence""). 

Each of the warrants is 

in the  same  form, authorising that  entry  and  the  seizure of 

things which satisfy the three conditions specified in para. 2 

of  the  information.  Each  of  the  warrants  recite  that  the 

justice,  ""belng  satisfied  by  information  on  oath  ...  that 

there  is  reasonable  ground  for  suspecting  that  there  is  in 

premises  [then specified] THINGS which  satisfy  all  THREE  of 

the following conditions....""  It will be noted that the third 

condition  in  the  information refers  to  s.29D  of  the  Crimes 
Act. -  It  is  there provided  that  a person who  defrauds  the 
Commonwealth is guilty of an indictable offence. 

THE GROUNDS OF THE APPLICATION FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW 

In order to understand the nature of the proceedings 

dealt with at first instance, it will suffice to refer to the 

amended application for an order of review filed on behalf of 

Mr. Edney.  This application sought review of the decisions to 

issue the warrants in respect of the office of Edney Lawrence 

and  the  home  of  Mr.  Edney.  Relevantly, the  grounds  of  the 

application were stated in these terms: 

""The grounds of the application are:
--------
1 .  

the  d e c i s i o n s   w e r e   not  a u t h o r i s e d   by

Australia Act 1976 and its accrued jurisdiction. 

THE ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES AND  THE DECISION OF  THE PRIMARY 
JUDGE 

At  the  trial,  and  before  us,  the  appellants 

contended that  the warrants were bad  on their  face, in that 

their terms were, it was argued, uncertain and overly complex. 

It  was  also  said  that  the  warrants  failed  to 

identify  offences  known  to  the  law;  and  in  particular,  the 

reference in the information and the warrants to  ""assessable"" 

income was  criticised  on  the  ground  that  the  only  relevant 

statutory obligation was  to lodge a return stating all income 

derived  in  the  sense  explained  in  North  Coast  Grazina  Ptv. 
Ltd. v  Federal  Commissioner  of  Taxation  (1987) 15  FCR  104; 

that  is  to  say,  the  argument  went,  there  was  no  statutory 

obligation to disclose ""assessable"" income. 

At  first  instance,  Whitlam  J.  held  (1) that  the 

warrants  stated the requisite satisfaction of  the  justice of 

the peace  and  (2) that the substance of the offence could be 

plainly  understood.  The  particulars  given  of  the  offences, 

although  inappropriately phrased, were  in  order, his  Honour 

held,  because,  applying  observations  by  Burchett  J.  in 

Beneficial  Finance  Cor~oration v  Commissioner  of  Australian 

Federal Police  (1991) 31 FCR  523  (at 545),  they  ""narrow the 

statement of the offences so as to lndicate that the offences 

relate to particular activities, and they indicate boundaries
--------
for the area of  search"" 

The  appellants  further  argued  at  the  trial,  and 

before  us, that those seeking  the issue of  the warrants  had 

failed  to  discharge  the  ""strict duty  of  full  disclosure of 

material  facts""  to  the  justice  of  the  peace  in  the  sense 

explained in Karina Fisheries Ptv. Ltd. v Mitson  (1990) 26  FCR 

473  at  480-3; 

it  was  contended  that  they  should  have 

disclosed that, in the course of  a tax audit, the Australian 

Tax  Office  already  had  obtained  numerous  documents  from  Bay 

Wool, Mr.  Dunesky and Mr. Edney. 

In rejecting this submission, Whitlam J.  said: 

""It cannot be  the case that an informant is obliged 
to set out everything that is known to him.  What he 
or she must disclose are the material facts.  Unless 
a  fact  can be  identified  as  having  been  both  not 
disclosed  and  material  (in the  sense  that  it  may 
have affected the exercise of discretion of the JP), 
there will be  no breach  of  the relevant duty.  The 
applicants are unable to point  to such a fact.  The 
fact  that  many  of  the  documents  sought  by  the 
warrants might be  originals of documents, copies of 
which were already available to the informant, could 
be readily inferred from the information."" 

THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL 

By  their  amended  grounds  of  appeal, the appellants 

again contend that the warrants were bad  because  (1) they were 

excessively  broad  and  uncertain; 

( 2 )   they  disclosed  no 

offence known to the law;  and  ( 3 )  there had been a failure to 

disclose material facts.
--------
CONCLUSIONS ON THE APPEAL 

(a)  The ~rinci~les to be ao~lied 

As  the  Full  High  Court  said  in  Georae  v  Rockett 

(gtRockett"") (1990) 170 CLR 104 (at 110), a case concerned with 

a provision in substantially the same terms as  S. lO(1)  of the 

Crimes Act, the questions now raised turn on the construction 

of  the  provision  and,  of  course,  its  application  in  the 

present  circumstances. 

In  Rockett,  Mason  C.J.,  Brennan, 

Deane, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ. went on (at 110- 

1) to point  out that because  a  search warrant  authorises an 

invasion  of  premises  without  the  consent  of  those  in 

possession  or  occupation,  its  validity  depends  upon  the 

fulfilment of  the  statutory conditions;  and that, since the 

provision is a far-reaching exception to the common law rules 

protecting  property  and  privacy,  a  warrant  must  comply 

strictly with the statutory conditions governing its issue. 

The High  Court proceeded  to  consider the operation 

of  the  relevant  conditions  under  three  headings  (1)  the 

justice's  function;  (2) the material to ground the issue of a 

warrant;  and (3) the facts to be established, as follows: 

(1)  The iustice's  function 

As  to the  justice's  function, it was held  (at 111) 

that  the  opening  words  of  the  provision  impose  upon  the 

justice  the  duty  of  satisfying  himself  or  herself, 

independently of the views of those seeking the warrant, that
--------
the requisite conditions are fulfilled:  see, e.g., Televantos 

v  The  Commonwealth of  Australia  (unreported, 28 April  1993, 

Full Federal Court).  Additionally, the warrant should express 

the  justice's  satisfaction that  there  are  reasonable grounds 

for the suspicion and belief. 

(2)  The material to around the issue of a warrant 

With respect to the material to ground the issue of 

a  warrant, the  High  Court  held  (at  114) that  the  statutory 

requirement  is  that  the  sworn  information  should  contain 

sufficient  facts  to  found  the  reasonable  suspicion  and  the 

reasonable belief  respectively mentioned  in the  statute.  If 

that  requirement  is  not  satisfied, any  information otherwise 

conveyed is immaterial. 

(3)  The facts to be established 

As to the facts to be established, it was held that 

the statute requires that the justice must be satisfied that 

there are ""reasonable grounds for suspecting"" that there is in 

any  premises  ""anything"" as  to  which  there  are  ""reasonable 
grounds for believing that the thing 'will ... afford evidence 
It  was 
as  to  the  commission  of  any  offence'""  (at  115). 

further held  (at 115) that suspicion and belief  are different 

states  of  mind; 

and  that,  in  its  ordinary  meaning, 

""suspicion"" 1s  ""a state of  conjecture or surmise where proof 

is  lacking"" and that the  facts which can reasonably ground  a 

suspicion  may  not  reasonably  ground  a  belief; 

yet  some
--------
factual  basis 

for 

the  suspicion  must  be  shown.

should resolve the differences and  decide  for itself whether 

there  is  a  duty  on  the  part  of  the  informant  to  disclose 

material facts to the Justice issuing a warrant and, if so, to 

define the nature and scope of the duty. 

We  do  not  find  it  necessary  to  consider  whether 

their Honours'  judgments  reflect differences of  principle  or 

merely of emphasis because, for reasons given later, if  there 

was  an obligation to  disclose  the material  facts, this  duty 

was discharged here. 

(b)  The a~~lication of these princi~les in the Dresent 

circumstances 

(i)  Are the warrants too broad and uncertain? 

It  will  be  recalled  that  the  warrants  recite  the 

justice's  satisfaction, by  the  sworn  information, that  there 

is  ""reasonable  ground  for  suspecting  that  there  is  in 
[specified] premises ... THINGS which satisfy all THREE  of the 
... conditions [then stated]."" 

In  support  of  their  contention  that  the  warrants 

lacked  the  necessary particularity, the  appellants rely upon 

the  observations of  Mason  C.J.,  Brennan,  Gaudron  and  McHugh 

JJ. in 

v E  (1994) 120 ALR  415 (at 418) that - 

""Statutory authority  to  engage  in  what  otherwise 
would be tortious conduct must be clearly expressed 
in unmistakable and unambiguous language.""
--------
In our view, the source of the authority to search and  seize 

in  the  present  case  is  to  be  found  clearly  expressed  in 

s.lO(1). 

The  essential  question  here  is  whether  the 

conditions 

there 

stipulated  were, 

in 

the 

instant 

circumstances,  strictly  complied  with.  In  undertaking  this 

inquiry, no real assistance can be gained from a consideration 

of  the  analysis  made  of  the  sufficiency  or  otherwise  of 

informations and warrants in other instances.  All the decided 

cases  have  emphasised  that  sufficiency  in this  context must 

depend  upon  the  particular  circumstances  of  the  matter  at 

hand.  It follows, in our view, that no useful purpose will be 

served here by a comparative analysis of the kind sought to be 

made in the arguments advanced on behalf of the appellants, of 

first, the adequacy of  other informations and warrants in the 

decided  cases  and,  secondly,  of  the  reasons  why  those 

informations  and  warrants  were,  or  were  not,  held  to  be 

insufficient. 

As has been noted, complaint is made as to the width 

of  the warrants.  It  is  said that  they  are not  sufficiently 

specific,  in  their  terms,  in  identifying  the  object  of  the 

search.  We reject the submission. 

It is  true, as  the  High  Court observed  in Rockett 

(at 117), that ""the broader and less specific the description, 

the  more  difficult  it  is  likely  to  be  to  satisfy  the 

requirement of  reasonable grounds  for believing  that  a thing
--------
answering  the  description  will  afford  evidence  of  the 

commission of  an offence.""  But  it must  follow that the real 

question here is whether that requirement has been satisfied, 

bearing in mind, as the High Court also pointed out in Rockett 

(at 117),  that  the  ""more specific  the  description, the more 

difficult  it may  be to satisfy the requirement of  reasonable 

grounds  for  suspecting that  the  designated  object  is  in the 

particular location"". 

In our opinion, there is nothing in the form of the 

warrants,  and  in  particular,  there  is  nothing  in  the 

description  of  the  things  the  object  of  the  search, which 

leads  to  the  conclusion  that  any  of  the  warrants  is  bad. 

Subject, as has been  said, to compliance with  the conditions 

stipulated in s.lO(1)  as explained in Rockett, it  is not, in 

our  opinion,  impermissible  to  describe  the  object  of  the 

search in a broad, or non-specific fashion. 

Were  the  statutory  conditions  fulfilled  in  the 

present case, looking at the matter  objectively in the sense 

explained  in Rockett?  In our view, the requisite conditions 

were complied with for these reasons. 

In  the  first  place, 

in  terms  of  the  justice's 

function, it was  sufficient, in our view,  for the  justice to 

express  her  satisfaction  in  a  recital  in  the  warrants  by 

information on oath by  reference to what  are  said  to be  the
--------
requisite matters  stated in the  form of  the three conditions 

then  specified. 

The  observations  in  Rockett  (at  111) 

discussed  above  do  not  suggest  that  the  expression  of  the 

justice's  satisfaction must take any particular form. 

The  justice  expressed  her  satisfaction  as  having 

been  derived  from  the  material  in  the  sworn  information. 

There  is  no  suggestion  that  the  justice's  satisfaction was 

derived from other material.  The second element described by 

the High Court, the material to ground the issue of a warrant, 

has been established. 

Has  the  third  ingredient  (the  facts  to  be 

established,  as  the  High  Court  described  it  (at  115))  been 

made out?  In order to decide this, it will  be  necessary to 

consider  the  terms  of  the  warrants  in  light  of  the 

information. 

In  their  terms,  the  warrants  purport  to  authorise 

entry  upon  the  premises  specified  and  further  purport  to 

authorise seizure of  ""any such things that satisfy 

of  the 

THREE above conditions and as may be found in the said place"". 

This  leads  one  to  inquire  as  to  the  meaning  of  the  three 

conditions.  It will be necessary to take them individually in 

the first place, but, ultimately, to take them collectively in 

the  sense  that  one  only  arrives  at  the  final  stage  of  the 

inquiry (the third condition) after a thing has satisfied both
--------
- 26  - 

of the previous conditions. 

Some of the things nominated  in the first condition 

are  described  by  reference  to  their  specific  character, for 

instance, ""receipts"".  Other things described here are defined 

in  a  broader  fashion,  for  example,  ""file  notes""  or 

""memoranda"".  However, the definition of what may be  searched 

for and  seized is narrowed or refined by  the language of  the 

second condition.  By the terms of  the second condition, the 

thing in question must  also  ""relate to, arise out of or  [be] 

connected  with""  any  of  the  transactions  described. 

It  is 

true,  as  counsel  for  the  appellants  submitted, that  ""relate 

to"" and the other phrases used here are wide in their import. 

However, again their operation is refined by the character of 

the stated transactions, notwithstanding that some of them are 

described broadly, as for instance, the  ""receipt or payment of 

monies by Dunesky"". 

Once  more,  the  refining  process  takes  us  to  the 

third  condition.  In  this  condition, we  find  a  number  of 

limitations. 

First,  there  must  be  reasonable  grounds  for 

believing  that  the  thing  will  afford  evidence  as  to  the 

commission of one of the nominated offences alleged.  It will 

be  necessary  to  come  soon to  the  way  in  which  the  alleged 

offences were described.  But first, mention should be made of 

an argument that  in this condition there is an impermissible 

attempt  to  delegate  to  the  police  officer  a  discretion  to
--------
decide which  things may  be  seized  (see Auckland  Medical  Aid 

Trust v  Tavlor  [l9751 1 NZLR  728;  Rosenberq  v  Jaine  [l9831 

NZLR 1). 

Section  lO(1)  requires  that  the  requisite 

satisfaction, as  Rockett decided, is that of  the  justice and 

not  that  of  the  executing  officer.  But,  in  our  view,  the 

third condition does not infringe this principle.  Rather, in 

our opinion, by  referring to  ""reasonable grounds"" of the kind 

specified, the condition makes  it clear that the warrant  is, 

in objective  terms, limited  to, and  in  accordance with,  the 

conditions  laid  down  by  the  provisions  of  s.lO(1). 

In 

particular, its operation does not depend upon the subjective 

opinion of  the  executing  officer.  If  the executing officer 

seizes things as  to which  the relevant reasonable grounds do 

not  (objectively) exist, the seizure is not authorized by  the 

terms  of  the  warrant. 

The  possibility  that  an  executing 

officer  may  exceed  or  even  misconstrue  the  terms  of  the 

warrant does not demonstrate that its terms are ""too broad and 

uncertain."" 

Two  matters  should  be  noted  in  this  connection. 

First, the present question is one of initial validity of  the 

warrant so that, of necessity, the matter is tested as at the 

date  of  its  issue.  Secondly, it must  follow that  anything 

done, or omitted to be done, by  the executing officer cannot 

bear upon the initial validity of the warrant.  The officer's
--------
function is to execute the warrant in accordance with  (1) its 

terms  and  (2)  the  provisions  of  s.lO(1). 

If  there  is  a 

failure to comply with those terms or those provisions, it may 

be  accepted that the officer could be  liable on that account 

and  that,  on  a  quia  timet  basis,  the  Court  might  restrain 

apprehended  future  illegal  action. 

But  that  is  another 

matter.  As has been said, the present question is whether the 

justice acted within power. 

It  will  be  recalled  that  the  third  condition 

commences with  a reference to there being  ""reasonable grounds 

for  believing  that  [things  satisfying  the  first  two 

conditions] will  afford evidence as to the commission of  one 
or more  of  the  . . .  offences against laws of  the Commonwealth 
[then  described]  which  offences  are  suspected  on  reasonable 

grounds  to  have  been  committed"".  Two  comments may  be  made 

here,  neither  of  which  suggests  that  the  warrant  might  be 

invalid on that account.  In the first place, the reference to 

the  requisite  belief  and  suspicion  is  a  recitation  of  the 

relevant  requirements  of  s.lO(1). 

No  departure  from  the 

statutory provisions is involved.  Moreover, as has been said, 

only  those  things  which,  objectively  speaking, are  able  to 

satisfy, inter alia, these aspects of the statutory conditions 

may lawfully be seized by the police.  Secondly, in our view, 

the real object of  the third condition is the  identification 

of the kind of offences alleged.  Again, this is done as part 

of  the refining process we  have mentioned.  In our opinion,
--------
this is a permissible method of drafting a warrant with a view 

to compliance with the requirements of s.lO(1). 

(ii) Do  the  warrants  disclose  an  offence  known  to  the 

The relevant offence is, as  stated in the warrants, 

defrauding  the  Commonwealth contrary  to  s.29D  of  the  Crimes 
m.  Section 29D so provides.  The criticism is made that, by 
referring  to  a  failure to  disclose  ""assessable"" income, the 

information and warrants were inconsistent with the provisions 

of  s.161(1)  of  the  Income  Tax  Assessment  Act  1936,  (""the 

Assessment  Act"")  as  it  then  stood. 

By  s.161(1),  it  was 

provided that every person shall furnish to the Commissioner a 

return  setting  forth  a  full  and  complete  statement  ""of the 
total income . . . and of  any deductions or losses"".  That is, 
the  argument  runs,  the  focus  of  S.  161(1)  is  not  upon 

""assessable"" income.  The argument proceeded that ""assessable"" 

income may  include profits or gains of a capital nature which 

would not fall within the concept of  ""income"" according to its 

ordinary  and  natural  meaning,  which  is  the  meaning  to  be 

attributed to the words  ""the total income"" in S.  161(1).  It 

was  argued  that  to  this  extent  the  information  and  the 

warrants failed to disclose a relevant alleged offence. 

In our view, the submission should not be accepted. 

The argument fastens on the words  ""assessable income"" in the 

information and the warrants on the assumption that they bear 

the same meaning as they do in the Assessment Act  (S. 6(1)),
--------
namely,  ""all the  amounts  which  under  the  provisions  of  the 

Assessment  Act  are  included  in  the  assessable  income"", an 

expression which  may  include profits  or  gains  of  a  capital 

nature.  There  is  no  justification for that  assumption.  As 

used  in  the  information  and  warrants,  the  expression 

""assessable income"" means  simply  all  of  the  income received 

which may be  assessable income under the Assessment Act.  The 

fact that ""assessable income"" as defined in the Assessment Act 

may  include capital  gains  or  profits  which  are  not  embraced 

within the ordinary understanding of the word  ""income"" as used 

in S. 161(1) is not to the point. 

There  is  a  further,  and  independent,  reason  for 

rejecting  the  appellants'  argument.  The  relevant  offence, 

that  of  defrauding  the  Commonwealth,  is  stated  in  the 

information and the warrants.  The addition of the particulars 

of  the  offence by  reference to  the  omission of  ""assessable"" 

income  not  only  is  not  misleading,  but  also,  in  our  view, 

actually  assists  the  reader  of  the  warrants  to  understand 

better  the  nature of  the  offence alleged  than if  the matter 

had  rested  with  a  general  statement  of  the  offence  in  the 

language of s.29D. 

(iii) Was  there  a  failure  to  disclose material  facts to 

the iustice? 

The information stated that an investigation and tax 

audit had  been  carried out.  Moreover,  the  facts alleged  in 

the  information  and  its  attachments  clearly  conveyed  the
--------
message  that  the  authorities already held  a  substantial body 

of  information  and  material.  In  other  words,  it  was  made 

plain  to  the  justice that  although  a  considerable amount  of 

material alleged to support a case of  ""laundering"" already was 

held, a  search  for  other material  was  desired  to  supplement 

the existing information.  There was nothing improper or even 

unusual  in  the  authorities  taking  this  course. 

On  the 

contrary, it reasonably could be expected that they would wish 

to do  so  in order to  check  the position  so  far as  possible 

before making a decision to prosecute or not to do so. 

Nor  is  there  any  substance  in  the  contention  of 

counsel  for  the  appellants  that  there  was  in  this  case  a 

misrepresentation by  omission or a  lack of  good  faith on the 

part of the informant. 

No  case for judicial revlew has been made  out.  We 

would dismiss the appeals, with costs. 

I  certify  that  this  and  the  preceding 
thirty  (30) pages  are a  true copy of  the 
Reasons  for  Judgment  herein  of  their 
Honours Lockhart, Beaumont and Hill JJ.

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT 

LINDGREN J: 

I  concur  in  the  reasons  found  in  the  joint  judgment  of 

Lockhart, Beaumont and Hill JJ and  in the orders proposed by 

their Honours, but  wish  to  add the following observations  in 

relation  to  two  issues.  I  take  the  jolnt  ludgment  and  the 

judgment of the Chief Justice as read. 

1. 

The  ""suspected  on  reasonable  arounds  to  have  been 

committed"" issue. 

The words  ""which offences are suspected on  reasonable ground 

to  have  been  committed""  in  the  THIRD  CONDITION  are,  in  my 

oplnion,  ""words of  recital"", that  is  to  say,  they  are  a 

factual description of  all  four of  the offences  subsequently 

referred  to  in  the  paragraphs  numbered  (i),  (ii),  (iii) and 

(iv)  of  the  THIRD  CONDITION. 

They  are  not  ""words  of 

qualification"", that is to  say, they do purport  to  limit the 

offences referred to, to those of the four offences specified 

that  ""are  suspected  on  reasonable  grounds  to  have  been 

committed"". 

2. 

The  issue  of  the  source  of  the  ""reasonable  arounds  for 

belief"" referred to in the warrants.
--------
The Chief Justice is of the view that the words  in the THIRD 

CONDITION,  ""as  to  which  there  are  reasonable  grounds  for 

believing  that  the  same  will  afford  evidence  as  to  the 
commission of one or more of . . . ""  do not suffice to limit the 
warrants to the extent that sub-section lO(1)  requires.  With 

great respect, I am not of that view. 

It cannot be disputed that in becoming satisfied that there is 

reasonable  ground  for  suspecting  that  there  exists  at  the 

location  in  question  a  thing  within  the  description  in  para 

10(l)(b),  the magistrate or justice (""the Issuer"") is confined 

by  reference  to  the  information  on  oath:  Georae - 

v  Rockett 

(1990)  170  CLR  104  at  113-115. 

The  point  of  difference 

between the Chief Justice's  view and mine is that according to 

his  but  not mlne,  some words  such  as  ""found by  reference to 

the  sworn  information"" would  have  to  be  inserted  immediately 

following  the  words  ""reasonable  grounds""  in  the  THIRD 

CONDITION if the warrants in the present case were to be made 

intra vires in conformity with Georae v Rockett. 

In my  opinion, this construction of  sub-section  10  (1) fails 

to  take  into  account  that  the  very  existence  of  a  thing  in 

respect  of  which  a  warrant  may  be  issued  need  not  be  the 

subject  of  reasonable  grounds  for  ""belief"" and  need  be  the 

subject  only  of  reasonable  ground  for  ""suspicion"".  Sub- 

section lO(1)  cannot be intended to requlre that the Issuer be 

satisfied that at  the time  of  issue there  actuallv  exist  in
--------
relation  to  anv  specific  thinq,  the  reasonable  grounds  for 

belief  referred to in para  (b).  The reason is that the sub- 

section does not go so far as to require that there then exist 

reasonable  grounds  for  belief  that  the  offence  has  in  fact 

been  committed or that any thing referred to in the paragraph 

does in fact exist at the  location specified.  Paragraph  (b) 

describes a quallty whlch the thing will  be  found to possess 

if it exists -  a quality  of  a thing suspected to exist. 

A 

thlng  having  the  quality  referred  to  in  para  (b) must,  on 

reasonable  grounds  found  by  reference  to  the  sworn 

information, be  sus~ected to exist at the location specified: 

in a case where only suspicion existed previously if the thing 

is in fact found to exist it is only at that stage that it can 

be  said that a  specific thing must  be  believed  on reasonable 

grounds to have the quality referred to. 

The construction of sub-s lO(1) and the task of the Issuer are 

usefully  considered  in  the  context  of  the  nature  of  the 

offences in question and  the nature and  extent of things apt 

to  afford  evldence  of  the  commission of  such  offences.  The 

first question confronting the Issuer is whether he or she is 

satisfied by the sworn information that the offences suggested 

are suspected on reasonable grounds to have been committed.  I 

assume  henceforth  that  the  Issuer  is  so  satisfled.  In  the 

present case, the offences suspected on reasonable grounds to 

have been  committed  extended over a period  of  more  than  four 

years from November 1984 to January 1989.  The first principal 

offence referred to  (in para  (i) of  THIRD CONDITION) is that
--------
Bay  Wool  Pty  Ltd  (""Bay Wool"") defrauded  the  Commonwealth by 

failing  to  declare  all  its  assessable  income  for  four 

financial years.  Moreover, the sworn information (referred to 

in the  loint  judgment) suggests that  a  substantial number of 

transactions  generated  income for Bay  Wool  over  that period. 

Accordingly, numerous documents and financial records might be 

expected  to  afford  evidence  of  Bay  Wool's  assessable  income 

over the four financial years, and of the fraudulent nature of 

Bay  Wool's  alleged  failure to  declare  that  income.  Similar 

observations  apply  to  the  other  principal  offence  alleged 

(against Dunesky  in para  (iv) of  the THIRD CONDITION) and to 

the accessory offences alleged (in paras  (ii) and  (iii) of the 

THIRD CONDITION. 

I assume henceforth that the Issuer is satisfied by  the sworn 

information  that  there  is  reasonable  ground  for  suspecting 

that there are, at  the location  in  question, documents which 

have  the  quality  that,  if  and  when  inspected,  they  would 

induce  a  belief  in  a  reasonable  person  (Georae v  Rockett, 

supra,  at  112)  that  they  will  afford  evidence  as  to  the 

assessable income of Bay Wool  or otherwise of  the commission 

of one or more of the specified offences. 

Neither the informant nor the Issuer can describe specifically 

all  or  perhaps  any  of  those  documents. 

Yet  it  is  to  be 

supposed  that  sub-section  lO(1)  was  intended  to  enable  the 

issue of  effective  search warrants  in respect of  offences of 

this kind.  It is difficult to see how this might be achieved
--------
unless  the  warrants  describe  the  documents by  reference,  in 

some  way,  to  an  offence  suspected  of  having  been  committed 

(see The  Oueen  v  Tillett  (1969) 14  FLR  101  (ACT/Fox  J)  at 

113).  Although it is conceivable ln the present case that all 

documents  satisfying  the  FIRST  CONDITION  and  the  SECOND 

CONDITION  were  documents  as  to  which  there  were  reasonable 

grounds  for believing  that  they  would  afford  evidence  as  to 

the  commission  of  one  or  more  of  the  offences,  reflection 

might suggest some which did not possess this further quality. 

(It was  not  submitted  that  the warrants  were  supportable by 

reference to the FIRST CONDITION and SECOND CONDITION alone.) 

This is  a difficulty which  confronts the  Issuer who must  ask 

which  of  the  potentially  numerous  documents  satisfying  the 

FIRST  CONDITION  and  the  SECOND  CONDITION,  sub-section  lO(1) 

permits to be made the subject of a warrant.  The answer is, 

relevantly,  any  ""as  to  which  there  are  [objectively] 

reasonable  grounds  for  believing  that  [they]  will  afford 

evidence as to the  commission of  any"" offence falling within 

para  (a) of  sub-section  lO(1)  and  (necessarily) specified in 

the warrant. 

The  Issuer must  found exclusively upon  the  sworn information 

and must assume that those executing a warrant will have only 

the terms of the warrant and the terms of the documents being 

inspected  as  the  basis  for  deciding  whether  there  are 

reasonable grounds  for believing  that the  latter will  afford 

evidence as to the commission of an offence referred to in the
--------
former.  The  more  information  a  warrant  contains  as  to  the 

nature  of  the  suspected  offence,  the  better  equipped  will 

those  executing  it  be  to  determine  whether  there  are 

reasonable  grounds  for  believing  that  a  particular  document 

will afford evidence of the commission of the offence.  In my 

opinion  the  offences  are  described  with 

sufficient 

particularity  in  the warrants  in  the present  case to  negate 

any  suggestion that the description  of  the objects of  search 

and seizure is too general and uncertain in that respect. 

The  words  ""any  such  thing""  towards  the  end  of  sub-s  lO(1) 

refer back, relevantly, to the words  of para  (b), ""any thing 

as to which there are reasonable grounds for believing that it 

wlll  afford  evidence  as  to  the  commission  of  any  such 

offence"".  On one view, the sub-section authorises the issue 

of a warrant for the seizure of, relevantly, documents on the 

basis  that  the  reasonable grounds  for belief  referred  to  in 

para  (b) are to  be  found exclusively  by  a  comparison of  the 

terms of the documents inspected wlth the terms of the offence 

stated in the warrant  (a view which has much to commend it). 

If  so,  the  warrants  in  this  case,  by  incorporating  the 

language of  para  10(l)(b),  are wlthin the authority conferred 

by  sub-s  lO(1)  so  construed.  Another  view  is  that  the  sub- 

section authorises the issue of  a warrant for the seizure of, 

relevantly, documents on the basis that the reasonable grounds 

for  belief  referred  to  in  para  (b) may  be  found  in  part 

otherwise than by  a comparison of  the terms of  the documents 

inspected  with  the  terms  of  offence  stated  in  the  warrant.
--------
According to thls view, the sub-section permits the issue of a

A copy of Ms Oldham’s AHRC complaint was lodged with the originating application in this proceeding, in accordance with the requirements of r 34.163 of the Federal Court Rules 2011 (Cth).2    For the reasons I set out below, the application is refused.Material considered on this application  3    In May 2015 counsel, on Mr Scott’s behalf, initially made an application to the Victorian Registry for inspection, which I refused on an ex parte basis on 22 May 2015, with short reasons. The reason given for seeking access related to the asserted relevance of the contents, or some of the contents, of Ms Oldham’s complaint, to Mr Scott’s criminal appeal proceedings, which were said to be listed for 9 July 2015. My chambers informed counsel that if his client sought to re-agitate the application for inspection, he should do so through an interlocutory application, the parties would be heard in relation to that application, and it would then be determined on the papers.4    On 17 September 2015, well after the nominated date for his appeal, Mr Scott, through his solicitors, made such an interlocutory application.5    The orders sought were:1.     An order allowing access to the Applicant’s Human Rights Complaint (referred to as the ‘statement’ in the Applicant’s Statement of Claim dated 24 December 2014).2.    Such further or other order as the Court deems appropriate.6    In support of the application, an affidavit by Mr Michael Smith, who had acted as defence counsel for Mr Scott at trial, was filed. In it, he deposed to his experience as a criminal defence counsel in New Zealand and his representation of Mr Scott in criminal trial proceedings in New Zealand. Although he was not counsel on the appeal, he deposed to what he considered to be the relevance of Ms Oldham’s complaint to Mr Scott’s appeal. 7    The respondents informed the Court they did not wish to be heard on the application.8    Ms Oldham sought to be heard and opposed the orders sought by Mr Scott. She filed an affidavit dated 2 October 2015 giving details about why she opposed Mr Scott’s application.9    Submissions on her behalf were also filed, and Mr Scott then filed submissions in response.Factual background10    I make the following findings of fact, based on the evidence adduced in this application, and by reference to the material filed in the proceeding itself, including the initial application for inspection.11    This proceeding concerns allegations of conduct by or on behalf of the respondents said to contravene the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth) and the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cth). The conduct is alleged to have occurred in the course of Ms Oldham’s employment with the first respondent, including conduct alleged to have occurred in New Zealand. Ms Oldham also alleges breaches of her contract of employment with the first respondent. The period covered by the allegations is unclear, but appears to be from approximately the middle of 2012 to the middle of 2013.12    Mr Scott is serving a sentence of imprisonment in New Zealand, having been convicted of three serious criminal offences in June 2014. As I have noted above on the material before the Court, his appeal was scheduled to be heard on 9 July 2015.13    Disclosure in these reasons of the detailed factual circumstances in which this inspection application is made could reveal matters that appear to have been the subject of orders protecting those matters from disclosure by the New Zealand courts, through a variety of methods. It is unnecessary to the determination of the inspection application to make any such detailed disclosure. For that reason, although I have read and considered them carefully, I do not set out, or refer to, the details of the affidavit material provided on the application by Mr Smith and by Ms Oldham.Relevant provisions14    Where a person wishes to bring a proceeding in this Court relying on the Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986 (Cth) (AHRC Act), the making of a complaint to, and the termination of that complaint by, the Australian Human Rights Commission is a precondition to the filing of an application in this Court: see s 46PO of the AHRC Act.15    Rule 34.163 of the Federal Court Rules provides:(1)    A person who wants to start a proceeding under the Human Rights Act must file an originating application, in accordance with Form 116.(2)    The originating application must be accompanied by:(a)    a copy of the original complaint to the Commission; and(b)    a notice of termination of the complaint given by the President of the Commission.(3)     The originating application must include any other claim that the person has, in addition to the claim of unlawful discrimination.Note:       The Registrar will fix a date and time and place for hearing and endorse those details on the originating application.16    One of the reasons for this rule is that this Court’s jurisdiction is limited by s 46PO(3) of the AHRC Act which provides:(3)    The unlawful discrimination alleged in the application:(a)     must be the same as (or the same in substance as) the unlawful discrimination that was the subject of the terminated complaint; or(b)     must arise out of the same (or substantially the same) acts, omissions or practices that were the subject of the terminated complaint.17    Therefore, in order to ascertain the extent of its jurisdiction in any particular proceeding, and deal with any objections to its jurisdiction, it is necessary for the Court to have before it a copy of the complaint made to the Commission. The nature and content of the complaint may of course have other forensic uses or purposes during a proceeding in this Court, but those uses or purposes do not explain the existence of r 34.163.18    The Court’s Rules also contain provisions recognising that courts administer justice in public, as ss 17 and s 37AE of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) make clear. Amongst those provisions are those relating to the inspection of documents filed in a proceeding. Enabling access to the documents which are the foundation of a proceeding is an important aspect of justice being done in public.19    For that reason, r 2.32(2) provides:A person who is not a party may inspect the following documents in a proceeding in the proper Registry:(a)    an originating application or cross-claim;(b)     a notice of address for service;(c)    a pleading or particulars of a pleading or similar document;(d)    a statement of agreed facts or an agreed statement of facts;(e)    an interlocutory application;(f)    a judgment or an order of the Court;(g)    a notice of appeal or cross-appeal;(h)    a notice of discontinuance;(i)    a notice of change of lawyer;(j)    a notice of ceasing to act;(k)    in a proceeding to which Division 34.7 applies:(i)    an affidavit accompanying an application, or an amended application, under section 61 of the Native Title Act 1993; or(ii)    an extract from the Register of Native Title Claims received by the Court from the Native Title Registrar;(l)    reasons for judgment;(m)    a transcript of a hearing heard in open Court.Note:       Native Title Registrar and Register of Native Title Claims are defined in the Dictionary.20    Parties have broader rights of access to documents: see r 2.32(1).21    The Court’s powers to identify documents and evidence which should be, in accordance with applicable principles, subject to suppression or non-publication (now located in ss 37AE to 37AL of the Federal Court Act) are recognised in r 2.32(3) which provides:However, a person who is not a party is not entitled to inspect a document that the Court has ordered:(a)    be confidential; or(b)    is forbidden from, or restricted from publication to, the person or a class of persons of which the person is a member.Note:     For the prohibition of publication of evidence or of the name of a party or witness, see sections 37AF and 37AI of the Act.22    Rule 2.32(4) provides a mechanism by which, in the exercise of its discretion, the Court may permit inspection of a document outside the categories in r 2.32(2):A person may apply to the Court for leave to inspect a document that the person is not otherwise entitled to inspect.23    It has been held that a complaint to the Commission does not form part of the originating application, and therefore leave is required to inspect such a document: see Charles v Fuji Xerox Australia Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1531; 105 FCR 573. The terms of r 34.163 (that the originating application must be “accompanied by” the AHRC complaint) also make it clear, in my opinion, that the complaint is to be treated under the Rules as a document separate from the originating application itself. Rule 2.32(2)(a) does not say, for example, “an originating application and any documents the Rules require to be attached to it, or to accompany it”.Resolution24    The power to permit inspection of a document under r 2.32(4) is discretionary. In exercising that discretion, it is appropriate for the Court to consider first, the delineation apparent in the terms of r 2.32(2) and other documents which may be on the court file. Subject to the operation of ss 37AE to 37AL and r 2.32(3), the delineation is this. A non-party (and therefore, any member of the public) is entitled to know who the parties to a proceeding in this Court are, and to have an address (through a notice of address for service) for those parties. A member of the public is entitled to see those documents which will enable that person to understand what a proceeding in this Court is about, and how the parties’ respective cases are framed: namely, the originating application and the pleadings. The public is entitled to be able to follow the course of the proceedings through processes such as interlocutory applications, appeals and discontinuances. The public is entitled to be able to see the Court’s reasons for the disposition of a proceeding.25    If there is a transcript of a hearing held in public on the Court’s file, then by r 2.32(2)(m) that document may be inspected. The rationale for that document being available as of right would appear to be to mirror the ability of the public to be present in court and to listen to the evidence and argument in the course of a proceeding.26    The entitlement of the public to be present when evidence is given in a proceeding (read with the underlying principles apparent in ss 17 and 37AE of the Federal Court Act) would suggest, subject to any competing discretionary considerations, that an affidavit which is “read” in a proceeding, and thus treated as if that evidence had been given orally in open court, should be made available for inspection: see Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Cassimatis (No 4) [2015] FCA 465 at [6]-[10], per Edelman J. An affidavit which is read is thus in no different position to oral evidence-in-chief given by a witness. To permit inspection of such an affidavit is consistent with inspection of transcript being available without leave under r 2.32(2)(m).27    An affidavit which has not been read is likely to be treated quite differently, for the same reasons. Before it is read, it is not a person’s evidence. It may never be admitted as the evidence of the deponent, for a variety of reasons. At that stage, it is a document yet to become part of the process of open justice. That is not to suggest an affidavit on a court file and not yet read in court may never be subject to an order under r 2.32(4). There may be no objection from the parties, and there may in any given case be discretionary considerations which favour its inspection.28    An AHRC complaint falls into none of the categories which I have so far traversed. Indeed, it generally forms no part of a proceeding in this Court at all. Rather, its existence is a precondition to, and a constraint on, this Court’s jurisdiction under the AHRC Act. The function it performs as a document within the records of the Court is thus a limited one. 29    As Ms Oldham submits, proceedings before the Commission are private (see for example s 46PK) and confidential between the parties to the complaint. Section 49 of the AHRC Act imposes significant non-disclosure obligations on the Commission and its staff, subject to exceptions (see s 49(3)) which would, for example, permit a member of the Commission’s staff to forward a complaint to this Court so it could accompany an application under s 46PO: (1)    A person who is, or has at any time been, a member of the Commission or a member of the staff referred to in section 43 or is acting, or has at any time acted, for or on behalf of the Commission shall not, either directly or indirectly:(a)     make a record of, or divulge or communicate to any person, any information relating to the affairs of another person acquired by the first-mentioned person by reason of that person’s office or employment under or for the purposes of this Act or by reason of that person acting, or having acted, for or on behalf of the Commission; or(b)     make use of any such information as is mentioned in paragraph (a); or(c)     produce to any person a document relating to the affairs of another person furnished for the purposes of this Act.Penalty: 50 penalty units or imprisonment for 1 year, or both.(2)    A person who is, or has at any time been, a member of the Commission or a member of the staff referred to in section 43 or is acting, or has at any time acted, for or on behalf of the Commission shall not be required:(a)    to divulge or communicate to a court any information relating to the affairs of another person acquired by the first-mentioned person by reason of that person’s office or employment under or for the purposes of this Act or by reason of that person acting, or having acted, for or on behalf of the Commission; or(b)    to produce in a court a document relating to the affairs of another person of which the first-mentioned person has custody, or to which that person has access, by reason of that person’s office or employment under or for the purposes of this Act or by reason of that person acting, or having acted, for or on behalf of the Commission;except where it is necessary to do so for the purposes of this Act.(3)    Nothing in this section prohibits a person from:(a)    making a record of information that is, or is included in a class of information that is, required or permitted by an Act to be recorded, if the record is made for the purposes of or pursuant to that Act;(b)     divulging or communicating information, or producing a document, to an instrumentality of a State in accordance with an arrangement in force under section 16; or(c)     divulging or communicating information, or producing a document, that is, or is included in a class of information that is or class of documents that are, required or permitted by an Act to be divulged, communicated or produced, as the case may be, if the information is divulged or communicated, or the document is produced, for the purposes of or pursuant to that Act.Note:     A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to a matter in subsection (3) (see subsection 13.3(3) of the Criminal Code).(4)    Nothing in subsection (2) prevents a person being required, for the purposes of or pursuant to an Act, to divulge or communicate information, or to produce a document, that is, or is included in a class of information that is or class of documents that are, required or permitted by that Act to be divulged, communicated or produced.(4A)     Subsection (1) does not prevent the Commission, or a person acting for or on behalf of the Commission, from giving information or documents in accordance with paragraph 20(4A)(e).Note:     A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to a matter in subsection (4A) (see subsection 13.3(3) of the Criminal Code).(4B)    Subsection (1) does not prevent a person from making a record of, divulging, communicating or making use of information, or producing a document, if the person does so:(a)     in the performance of a duty under or in connection with this Act; or(b)    in the course of acting for or on behalf of the Commission.Note:     A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in subsection (4B) (see subsection 13.3(3) of the Criminal Code).(5)     In this section:court includes any tribunal, authority or person having power to require the production of documents or the answering of questions.produce includes permit access to.30    One of the consequences of an applicant deciding to bring a proceeding in this Court under the AHRC Act is that the privacy and confidentiality which attended the Commission’s handling of the complaint does not continue in the way this Court deals with the subject matter of the complaint. That fact does not mean, in my opinion, that the complaint as the foundation document in the Commission should not continue to be afforded some protection in this Court, subject always to the considerations relevant in each given case.31    The Commission deals with complaints of unlawful discrimination under a number of federal statutes. Often, the subject matter of those complaints is intensely personal. Many complainants are not legally represented. They may, to use a colloquialism, “pour their hearts out” in a complaint to the Commission. However they express their complaints, they do so in the confidence of a private process, designed to facilitate resolution of complaints through confidential conciliation. Once a person elects to proceed to this Court, she or he has a fresh choice about the subject matter of the claim made in this Court, and how it is expressed. She or he cannot materially change or exceed the subject matter complained of before the Commission, but it can be narrowed and circumscribed. It can be couched in different language. In my opinion it would generally be inimical to the purpose and structure of the AHRC Act, which is based around confidentiality as between complainants, the Commission and respondents, for an AHRC complaint to be made available for public inspection in this Court.32    In the present case, I consider that principle is applicable. I reach that conclusion not without some hesitation because although I have said above that “generally” an AHRC complaint forms no part of the proceeding in this Court, that is not the case with Ms Oldham’s AHRC Complaint. Ms Oldham’s AHRC Complaint consists of two documents. The first is a nine page letter from her legal representatives to the Commission which sets out a summary of the facts of her complaint, the legal issues and the outcomes she sought before the Commission. The second is a forty-five page statement by Ms Oldham, which attaches various documents such as contemporaneous email messages. The statement bears Ms Oldham’s name but is not in the form of an affidavit or statutory declaration.33    The statement contains sensitive and personal material, not just about Ms Oldham, but about other people. It goes into considerable detail about the background to her complaint, her employment with the first respondent and the conduct she alleges contravenes the Sex Discrimination Act and the Disability Discrimination Act.34    In this Court, Ms Oldham’s statement of claim is expressly framed by reference to her statement to the Commission. Her statement which formed part of her AHRC Complaint is referred to in the particulars to various paragraphs of the statement of claim, and is there described as “Statement”. For example, I extract below the first two subparagraphs of paragraph [7] of the statement of claim:In the course of performing his duties and functions as the CEO and as Ms Oldham’s career counsellor, Mr Thorley:a.       did not arrange for Ms Oldham to undergo a thorough and detailed Capgemini induction, in contrast to the former employees of Satyam, who were all men, including Mr Nangia, he caused to be hired shortly thereafter;ParticularsStatement at [7]b.     failed and/or refused to conduct Ms Oldham’s performance reviews in accordance with Capgemini protocol;ParticularsStatement at [23]c.     …35    The statement of claim is replete with further pleadings of this nature. In that way, Ms Oldham’s private and confidential statement to the Commission has been expressly relied on in the pleadings in this Court. It was this pleading technique which no doubt encouraged the current inspection application.36    Pleadings are available for inspection by third parties as of right under r 2.32(2). The Dictionary in Sch 1 to the Rules defines “pleading” as including a statement of claim. There is no definition of “statement of claim”. I am not satisfied that a document to which reference is made in a statement of claim necessarily forms part of the statement of claim for the purposes of the inspection rules. A statement of claim (or defence) may refer, especially in the giving of particulars, to a number of different kinds of documents – for example correspondence, contractual documents or documents created by third parties. Those documents do not become part of the statement of claim itself. The statement of claim consists of the allegations of law and fact made in it. The material facts are to be contained in the pleading itself and not in the particulars: see r 16.02(1)(d). See also r 16.04 concerning documents to which a pleading refers. Whether Ms Oldham’s statement of claim complies with the Rules is not relevant to the present application and does not affect the conclusions I have reached. 37    A proceeding in this Court may be commenced by originating application and affidavit. An affidavit, even if it is the one on which the proceeding is founded, is not available for inspection as of right under r 2.32(2). I do not see why, for the purposes of the inspection rules, a document referred to in a statement of claim should be in any more vulnerable position. It may or may not form part of the evidence adduced at trial; it is not yet fully within the principles of open justice.38    Therefore, despite the express references in the particulars to the statement of claim to Ms Oldham’s AHRC Complaint, I do not consider the pleading in this form affects the approach I would otherwise take, and the conclusions I have otherwise reached, on this application.39    It is also appropriate for the Court to consider the reason access is sought. In a given case, a person’s reasons for requesting access to a document may provide a powerful discretionary consideration. I do not consider Mr Scott’s reason outweighs the considerations against the grant of access to which I have referred above.40    The reason given by Mr Scott for seeking access to the complaint is stated in Mr Smith’s affidavit, and in the initial correspondence to the Victorian Registry by his counsel on his appeal. It relates to the asserted relevance of the contents of the complaint to grounds for an appeal by Mr Scott to the New Zealand Court of Appeal from a serious criminal conviction in June 2014, with the appeal scheduled for 9 July 2015. It is apparent from Mr Smith’s affidavit and the submissions filed on behalf of Mr Scott that Mr Smith considers the contents of the applicant’s statement of claim in this proceeding may be of assistance to Mr Scott in an appeal.41    Currently, there is no evidence whether the appeal was heard on that date or not, nor whether there has been any disposition of the appeal. There is no explanation as to why it took until 17 September 2015 for the interlocutory application to be filed. There is no evidence therefore about the current utility of granting access to the AHRC Complaint, in terms of its use in any appeal. There is no evidence whether such a ground has in fact been raised on the appeal, nor whether the New Zealand Court of Appeal has been informed about this application. In my opinion, it is apparent that Mr Smith can articulate from the contents of the statement of claim the basis of an appeal ground which he considers may be available to Mr Scott. 42    That being the case, I accept Ms Oldham’s submissions that if this matter is to be pursued, it can be pursued in the New Zealand courts. Ms Oldham points to the provisions of the Criminal Disclosure Act 2008 (NZ) and a procedure by which a New Zealand court may compel a person or agency to disclose information that may assist a defendant properly to defend a criminal charge made against her or him.43    I have examined those provisions, in particular ss 24 to 29. So far as I understand them, they appear to apply principally in the conduct of a criminal trial, rather than appellate proceedings. However, the term “criminal proceedings” is defined in s 6 to include any appeal against conviction or sentence. Accordingly, the processes for which ss 24 to 29 provide may well apply to an appeal. Mr Scott’s reply submissions did not respond to this aspect of Ms Oldham’s submissions, even though Mr Smith would be the person best placed to have assisted the Court in understanding whether the procedures under the Criminal Disclosure Act, or any comparable procedures, were available on an appeal from a conviction. There is also the issue of their extra-territorial operation.44    It would be a matter for Mr Scott to persuade a New Zealand court on appeal that there was a sufficient basis for it to make a coercive disclosure or production order in relation to Ms Oldham’s AHRC Complaint. It is plain that an order could be sought against Ms Oldham herself, or the Commission, and certainly need not be sought against this Court, or the Registry of this Court. Seeking the AHRC Complaint from this Court is a somewhat indirect route. As Mr Scott’s submissions amply demonstrate, that basic argument (if it is in fact to be made at all) can be made on the basis of the statement of claim, to which he has a right of access and has in fact accessed through his legal representatives. Any further process for access to the AHRC Complaint could properly occur at a time when the relevance of the AHRC Complaint to Mr Scott’s interests is more than hypothetical: that is, where there is an appeal on foot, and a ground of appeal exists which is capable of bearing a relationship to the AHRC Complaint.45    Mr Scott contends, in the submissions filed on his behalf, that the “touchstone is the interests of justice”. That contention is too broadly expressed. This Court must be guided in the exercise of its discretion in r 2.32(4) by the interests of the administration of justice in this Court, and looks for guidance to any applicable common law principles, to the Federal Court Act and to the Rules. In my opinion, the interests of the administration of justice in this Court as between the parties to the proceeding, the public who are the beneficiaries of the open justice principle and (if they be relevant) the interests of other litigants in this Court, do not favour the release of the AHRC Complaint for inspection by Mr Scott, or by his legal representatives on his behalf. I have set out at [24] to [38] above where I consider those interests lie.46    The interests of the administration of justice in relation to Mr Scott are a matter for the New Zealand courts, fully seized of a relevant proceeding, and fully informed of the asserted relevance and context of the AHRC Complaint.47    Mr Scott submitted that the AHRC Complaint could be appropriately redacted by the Court before release. That is an impractical and inappropriate suggestion. It is not the Court’s function to speculate about which parts of the AHRC Complaint may be of assistance to Mr Scott and which may not.48    Finally, in the material in support of the application there are references to Mr Scott having a terminal illness. How that fact affects his criminal appeal process is a matter for the New Zealand courts. While not wishing to appear unsympathetic to Mr Scott if those are his circumstances, this fact in my opinion has no relevance to the inspection application. Even if it did, it would not in my opinion outweigh the matters I consider tell against access.Suppression and/or non-publication orders49    Orders under s 37AF of the Federal Court Act were sought by Ms Oldham, in relation to her affidavit and outline of submissions on the inspection application. Reliance was placed on certain grounds set out in s 37AG(1). 50    To be effective, any such order would need to extend to Mr Smith’s affidavit and Mr Scott’s outline of submissions.51    It has been possible to deal with this application, and the evidence adduced to support and oppose it, without disclosing any details of the evidence relied on in this application, or information which might contravene existing protections within the New Zealand criminal justice system.52    Neither the affidavits nor the submissions will be available for inspection as of right under r 2.23(2), although Mr Scott’s interlocutory application will be available, as will these reasons for judgment. Any person who wishes to inspect the affidavits and submissions would have to go through the kind of process Mr Scott has undertaken, and persuade the Court to exercise its discretion in r 2.32(4) favourably to permit inspection of the material accompanying the interlocutory application. That being the case, I do not consider that there is a real basis for a suppression or non-publication order on any of the grounds set out in s 37AG of the Federal Court Act.Conclusion53    The interlocutory application for leave to inspect the AHRC Complaint made by Ms Oldham must be refused, based on the current material before the Court. There is of course nothing to preclude a further application, on new or different material.54    Ms Oldham submits Mr Scott should pay the costs of the application. The application has been unsuccessful and the usual order is that costs would follow that event. In reply, Mr Scott did not make any submissions about the appropriate costs orders.55    It is unlikely that if the application had been successful, I would have ordered Ms Oldham (who actively resisted the application) to pay the legal costs of Mr Scott. The question is whether it is appropriate to order Mr Scott to pay Ms Oldham’s legal costs.56    Section 43 of the Federal Court Act empowers the Court to make orders for costs “in a proceeding”. That power extends to an order for costs against a non-party, although in such circumstances the power “must be exercised judicially and in accordance with general legal principles pertaining to the law of costs”: see Knight v F.P. Special Assets Limited [1992] HCA 28; 174 CLR 178 at 192, citing with approval the Court of Appeal of British Columbia in Oasis Hotel Ltd v Zurich Insurance Co (1981) 124 DLR (3d) 455 at 462. The non-parties against whom costs orders might be made generally have some discernible connection to the proceeding, such as legal practitioners or receivers of a party.57    Although this application is made “in” the proceeding between Ms Oldham and the respondents, in substance the subject matter and purpose of the application is completely divorced from this proceeding.58    Mr Scott was entitled to apply for leave under r 2.32(4), and did so in compliance with the manner the Court required. Ms Oldham chose to participate in the application but was not required to. Since she is legally represented in this proceeding and the submissions on her behalf were signed by senior and junior counsel, it is fair to infer she may have incurred legal costs by reason of her participation. In the circumstances as revealed by the evidence, it is understandable why she chose to participate. However, those are not costs which on any view it would be reasonable at the end of this proceeding (and in the event she is successful) to require the respondents to compensate her for. Rather she must bear them herself, or Mr Scott must bear them.59    The matter is finely balanced, but I have decided it is not appropriate to award costs against Mr Scott on this application. The distance between his interests and those of the parties to this proceeding have told against him on the exercise of discretion under r 2.32(4), and, in his favour, that distance suggests he should not be subject to an adverse costs order in the proceeding. Further, in the exercise of the costs discretion, it is appropriate that I take into account the fact he sought inspection for the purpose of advancing an appeal against a criminal conviction. There would be some injustice in making a costs order against him, where his application was said to inform part of the exercise of his right to appeal a conviction and to pursue all lawfully available grounds in that appeal.I certify that the preceding fifty-nine (59) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Mortimer.Associate:      Dated:    26 October 2015",2015-10-26 00:00:00,Federal Court of Australia

SENTENCING REMARKS OF MR JUSTICE WILKKIE
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

MURDER ‐ Count 1 
 

 

BHAYANI 
 

 

Rakesh Bhayani you have been convicted of the murder of Carole Waugh. By its 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

verdict of Guilty in respect of you, but not in respect of Nicholas Kutner the Jury 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

has made clear its conclusion that you murdered Carole Waugh, on the night of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16/17  April  as  you,  Bhayani,  admitted  to  witness  X,  arising  out  of  an  argument 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

about money but not as a necessary precursor to the fraud upon which you then 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

embarked.  It  follows  that  it  was  not  premeditated  or  preplanned  and  I  cannot 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

assume that you had as your intention an intention to kill 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It is nonetheless clear to me, on all the evidence, and I so find, that, though not 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required by your fraudulent plan, you did murder her for gain. You had, ruthlessly 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and  without  compunction,  targeted  her,  a  woman  who,  though  self  made, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

successful and independently wealthy, was a risk taker and manifestly vulnerable 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1
--------
to  the  machinations  of  professional  con  men  such  as  you  and  your  co‐fraudster 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kutner. 
 

 

Money was the occasion of the argument out of which you killed her and then, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

without a second thought, you and Kutner, to whom I will turn in a moment, calmly 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and comprehensively set about: stealing her identity;  using it to defraud banks and 
 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

other institutions, within three months, of over £250,000 worth of assets; set in 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

train  processes  which  would  have  realised  much  greater  rewards  for  you  in  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

near future, and in the course of that emptied an account specifically set up for the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

benefit  of  her  niece  and  tried,  as  far  as  you  could,  to  denude  her  estate  at  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

expense of her family. You took steps to ensure that her body would not be found 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for a sufficient time not only to give you the best chance of evading detection for 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

having killed her, but also, and additionally, to enable you and Kutner to embark 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

upon and complete, if you could, the asset stripping of her persona. You dumped 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

her body in a bag in the boot of an old car, you then left it in various car parks and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

latterly left her body to rot in a bag, in a car, in a lockup garage. These actions, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dismissive  and  disrespectful  of  the  remains  of  a  woman  who  regarded  you  as  a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

friend demonstrated your utter greed, callousness and total lack of any regard or 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect for your victim. 
 

 

 

 

 

Your  actions  in  persisting  with  your  fraud  after  killing  her  were  breathtakingly 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wicked and none  the  less  so  because  you  were  almost  bound,  eventually,  to be 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identified  as  the  perpetrator.  Your  compulsion  to  feed  your  addictions  to  risk 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

taking and gambling and your amorality and selfishness overwhelmed any notion 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of decency or restraint. 
 

 

 

 

 

As you know the only sentence I can pass on you for the offence of murder is one 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of life imprisonment and I do so. 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

I  must  fix  a  minimum  term  before  the  expiration  of  which  you  will  not  be 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

considered for release on life licence. The starting point where, as here, the killing 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2
--------
has been motivated for gain is 30 years. The concealment of her body in the way 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and for the purposes to which I have alluded is an aggravating feature. 
  

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

As I have indicated, by the verdict of the jury, I recognise that I may not regard 
 

   

   

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Carole  Waugh’s  death,  as  a  premeditated,  essential,  part  of  the  fraud  so  as  to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

require her to have been killed , but must regard it as unplanned and committed 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the spur of the moment. It nonetheless remains the case that, as I find, you did 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

kill her in the course of, or in anticipation of, the fraud with which you carried on 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

despite her death and having taken prompt steps to conceal her body to enable 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you to continue to do so. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Having regard to these matters the minimum term which you must serve before 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you can be considered for release on licence is one of 27 years. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There  will  be  deducted  from  that  term  the  number  of  days  you  have  been 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

remanded in custody which will be calculated administratively. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The effect of this is that until the expiration of the minimum term from today you 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

will not be considered for release on licence. Even then you will only be released, if 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

at all, when the Parole  Board has been satisfied that it is  safe and in  the public 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest for you to be released. After any such release and for the rest of your life, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you will be on licence and liable to be recalled to prison if you were to breach any 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the terms of the licence to which you were then subject. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I also have to pass sentences on you on the offences in counts 2 and 3 and I will do 
 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so.  These  sentences  will  run  concurrently  to  this  life  sentence.  I  have  taken 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

elements of them into account in determining the appropriate minimum term for 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this offence. 
  

 

 

PERVERTING THE COURSE OF JUSTICE ‐ Count 6 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3
--------
You Rakesh Bhayani have pleaded guilty to, and you Nick Kutner have been found 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

guilty  of,  perverting  the  course  of  justice.  On  the  evidence  I  have  heard  I  am 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

satisfied, of each of, you that you did, and/or encouraged and assisted in, each of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the following: disposing of the dead body of Carole Waugh, by putting it in a bag, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

purchased for the purpose, removing it from her flat, depositing it in the boot of a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

car, purchased for the purpose, leaving it in various car parks for about a month 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and then leaving it to rot in a lock up garage in New Malden having investigated 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  possibility  of  disposing  of  her  body  at  the  site  in  the  Cotswolds  which  you 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

visited together.. Thereafter you arranged for clearing her flat of the vast majority 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  her  personal  possessions  and  you,  Nick  Kutner,  arranged  for  the  flat  to  be 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cleaned and her remaining possessions removed and dumped. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

All of this, I am satisfied, you both undertook well knowing that Carole Waugh was 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dead  and  that,  by  your  actions,  you  would  obstruct  and  impede  the  search  for 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Carole Waugh and for the person who was responsible for her death. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In your case, Kutner, I am satisfied, from all of the evidence, that you were present 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in the flat when Bhayani murdered Carole Waugh, though you were not a party to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it  and  did  not  encourage  or  assist  in  its  commission.  Nonetheless,  you  were 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

immediately on board with the actions taken to conceal her death, and thwart the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigation into her murder, by assisting Bhayani in the removal and disposal of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

her body and clearing up the flat which I have described. 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Putting her body in the bag, then removing it from the flat and putting it into the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

boot of the car, was a job for two people and I am satisfied you both did it. You, 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kutner, assisted Rakesh Bhayani in doing what he could not have done on his own, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and, a month or so later, you made the arrangements for the trip to the Cotswolds. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I am also satisfied that you were instrumental in assisting Bhayani find the lock up 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in New Malden though you fought shy of accompanying him when he first drove 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

there and then later transported the body there. Later you organised the clearing 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and cleaning of the flat well knowing that she had been murdered though those 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4
--------
actions were also in part motivated by seeking quickly to realise the value of her 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

flat one way or another by remortgage, sale, or renting to multiple tenants. 

    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I am satisfied in both your cases that not only were you motivated by the desire to 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conceal  what  Bhayani  had  done  and  to  thwart  the  investigation  of  her 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disappearance and murder but also, and I regard this as a substantial aggravating 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

factor, you were both motivated by sheer greed. So greedy were you for what the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fraud would bring you that you did not allow the fact that Carole Waugh had been 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

murdered to stand in your way. You, Kutner, were already enjoying the fruits of it 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on 17 April at the Hilton Hotel and on the 18 April by gambling at the casino funded 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by the proceeds of the fraud, her jewellery and the gold purchased with her money 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

held by the bank. Thereafter you took the steps I have described to enable you to 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

continue  to  plunder  her  estate  with  impunity  for  a  number  of  months,  thereby 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gaining  for  yourselves  several  months  of  spending  her  money  on  what  you,  no 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

doubt, regarded as the high life. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  offence,  which  you  knew  you  were  covering  up,  and  were  obstructing  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigation of, was murder. Your course of conduct was not only persistent, over 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

a  period  of  months,  and  comprehensive  but  it  went  to  the  heart  of  the 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

investigation. The effect of moving and abandoning the body meant that, by the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

time  it  was  found,  it  was  in  such  a  state  of  decomposition  that  the  forensic 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pathologist  was  unable  to  say  with  certainty  what  the  mechanism  of  death  had 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been and vital clues as to who the murderer might have been were irretrievably 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

lost. Your wholesale removal and destruction of her possessions similarly robbed 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the investigators into her murder of a potential source of important evidence. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

As a result, I have no doubt, of what you did, the investigation into her death was 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

so delayed and hampered that there was a risk, happily not realised, that no one 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

would  be  convicted  of  her  murder.  In  any  event,  your  actions  caused  Carole’s 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

family to suffer the agonies of not knowing what had happened to her for several 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

months which have been so eloquently described by Christopher Waugh, Carole’s 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

brother, in his statement to this court. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5
--------
As between the two of you, I find that you, Bhayani, took the lead and had the 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

greater motive, namely to cover up your murder of Carole Waugh. You organised 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the purchase of the bag, purchased the car, stored it in car parks and drove the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

body to its temporary resting place in New Malden. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

However you, Kutner, assisted and encouraged all this in order to ensure that the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

flow of gold from plundering Carole Waugh’s estate would not stop until it was all 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

gone and played a part, not far short in culpability, to that of Bhayani. No wonder 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you could not sleep, showed signs of strain and, eventually, you, effectively, blew it 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

all by your multiple renting scam which was bound to be discovered. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Having regard to the authorities to which I have been helpfully referred, but taking 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

account, in both your cases, of the aggravating features to which I have referred, 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  dismissive  and  disrespectful  way  you  dealt  with  her  body  over  a  period  of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

months and the additional motivation of greed which drove you both, the sentence 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

upon you Rakesh Bhayani for this offence would, had you contested it, have been 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one of 9 years imprisonment. In light of your timely plea of guilty I sentence you to 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 years 
 
 

 

To reflect your slightly lesser role and the fact that it was not you who was the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

murderer whose crime you were covering up, but also to reflect the fact that you 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

were convicted after a trial, I sentence you Nick Kutner to 7 years imprisonment for 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

this offence. 
   

 

 

CONSPIRACY TO DEFRAUD ‐ Count 2 
 

 

 

 

BHAYANI AND KUTNER 
 

 

 

 

 

 

You have both pleaded guilty to this offence. In your case Nick Kutner on the basis 
 
that  you  only  became  involved  from  the  16th  May  long  after  Carole  Waugh  had 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been killed. 
 

 

 

 

6
--------
I reject that contention. I am satisfied that you were involved in the fraud from the 
 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

moment it swung into action. You were spending the fruits of the fraud as early as 
 
the 17th April when you stayed in the Hilton Hotel, whereas previously you had no 
 
money  to speak  of.  You  were  gambling  on  the  18th  April  with  a  stake  far  above 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

what  had  previously  been  your  norm.  In  both  these  instances  the  irresistible 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inference is that you were using money obtained from the fraud, from your sale of 
 
jewellery on the 17th and the sale of gold obtained in the fraud on the 18th. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I find that you, Bhayani, were the instigator and chief organiser of the fraud but 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you,  Kutner,  were  intimately  involved  as  confidant  and  adviser.  The  extent  to 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

which each of you substantially benefited financially from the fraud as evidenced 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by your pattern of spending on hotels, casinos and escorts reflects the leading role 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of each of you. 
 

 

 

 

 

I emphasise that, in determining the appropriate sentence for each of you on this 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conspiracy, I leave out of account the fact that you well knew that the victim was 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dead.  That  aspect  of  the  matter  is  reflected  in  the  sentence  I  have  passed  in 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect of perverting the course of justice. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This  was  a  complex,  serious,  fraud  committed  over  a  period  of  months  in  a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sophisticated  way  involving  a  number  of  individuals  playing  various  roles  and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

orchestrated carefully. As a result the identity of Carole Waugh was taken over and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

stripped  of  all  her  assets  in  a  number  of  different  ways  as  well  as  saddling  her 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

identity with new debts from new sources of credit and, for the vast majority of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the time. 
 

 

 

The goal of the fraud was to realise all of her assets, including her flat which was 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

worth £650,000. The total potentially realisable was estimated by you Bhayani as 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of the order of a million pounds. Whilst that is, in my judgment, an exaggeration, 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

but for Kutner’s act of greed, or desperation, in letting her flat to two tenants at 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  same  time,  a  sum  well  in  excess  of  half  a  million  pounds  might  have  been 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

realised. As the crown points out, however, it is an aggravating feature that the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7
--------
intended  subject  of  the  fraud  was  no  less  than  the  entirety  of  Carole  Waugh’s 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

worldly goods including the provisions she had made for her niece. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I have regard to the sentencing guideline applicable to banking and insurance fraud 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  which  I  have  been  referred,  as  well  as  to  the  fact  that  each  of  you  has  an 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

appalling record for offences of dishonesty the majority of which are for offences 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of fraud 
 

 

 

Bearing in mind all these matters but also bearing in mind, particularly in your case 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kutner, the principle of totality, in my judgment the appropriate sentence for you 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bhayani after a trial would have been one of  9 years imprisonment and for you 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Kutner 7 years imprisonment. 
  

 

 

 

 

Bhayani, you are entitled to full credit for your plea of guilty, the sentence I pass is 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6 years which will run concurrently to the sentence for perverting the course of 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

justice and to the life sentence which I have passed. In you case Kutner, your plea 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of  guilty  was  on  a  specific  and  limited  basis  which  I  have,  after  hearing  the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidence in this trial, rejected. You are not therefore entitled to full credit for a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

plea of guilty, though you are entitled to some credit. As a result I sentence you to 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

6  years  imprisonment  for  the  conspiracy  to  defraud.  That  sentence  will  run 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consecutively to the sentence of 7 years for perverting the course of justice. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I also have to sentence you Kutner for the three specific offences of fraud to which 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

you have pleaded guilty in respect of the prospective sale of Flat 6 (count 3) and 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the renting of that flat to two different tenants who paid you respectively £3,900 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and £7,000. (counts 4 and 5). 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

In respect of each of these you are entitled to full credit for your pleas of guilty.  I 
    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

apply the guidelines in respect of confidence fraud. For the fraud in respect of the 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

prospective sale of the flat the stating point after a trial is 5 years, the sentence I 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pass is 40 months count 3. For the other two frauds, for each of them the starting 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

point after a trial is 2 years, the sentence I pass is 16 months counts 4 and 5. Each 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8
--------
of these sentences will run concurrently to each other and to the sentence I have 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

passed for the conspiracy to defraud. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Thus  the  total  sentence  on  you  Nicholas  Kutner  is  one  of  13  years.  You  will  be 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

released on licence after you have served half of that term less the days you have 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been remanded in custody. Thereafter when released on licence you will be liable 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to recall if you were to be in breach of the terms of the licence to which you will 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

then be subject. 
   

 

 

 

DEREK EASTHAM 
 

 

 

I  have  to  sentence  you  for  two  offences  counts  10  and  24  to  which  you  have 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pleaded  guilty  Possessing  criminal  property  namely counterfeit currency, a  small

were  so  poor,  and  money  laundering,  namely  allowing  your  bank  account  to  be

represented the proceeds of a fraud, though you were unaware of its nature or 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

extent. 
 

 

I have had regard to the helpful note on sentencing prepared by the prosecution 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

on the appropriate levels of sentence for offences of this nature and seriousness 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and note, in particular, that as a result of your involvement, far from gaining from 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

it,  you  were  put  to  considerable  inconvenience  and  difficulty  because  the  bank 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

froze your account through which your benefits were paid leaving you for a time 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

potentially without any financial support. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

You not only pleaded guilty to these counts but you supported the prosecutions of 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Bhayani and Kutner by giving evidence which, I accept, was honest and helpful to 
 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the court. 
 

 

 

I have read your letter to the court and the pre sentence report. At times you have 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

been a person of great promise and achievement but you have also had very hard

times  to  an  extent  exacerbated  by  your  weakness  for  alcohol.  You  accept  that 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

when persuaded to commit these offences you were gullible and were duped into 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

involvement  with  something  that  was  totally  out  of  your  league.  You  have  a 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

number of previous convictions for minor offences of dishonesty and have served a

into schemes of dubious legality.

2242441,Application of the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police [2015] NSWSC 1170,"ex tempore Judgment


	
	This is an application for forfeiture under s 49(1) of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) (the Act) of a sum of over $11 million that has previously been the subject of a restraining order. There has been no attendance of the defendant today, and no representation of him. The threshold question arises whether I should permit the matter to proceed ex parte.
	
	
	In support of that proposition, the solicitor for the plaintiff read three affidavits. They establish that the plaintiff has sought to locate the defendant at both an address in Pyrmont and an address in Rockdale, each of which is derived from documents in Australia that are themselves based upon information given by the defendant at various times. Those efforts have not met with success.
	
	
	Documents have also been sent to an email address provided by the defendant. Eventually, all documents were received at that email address without the sender receiving any notification that the emails and their attachments had ""bounced"". That email address was provided by the defendant on an incoming passenger card of 4 February 2015 when he last entered Australia.
	
	
	Immigration records show that the defendant left Australia on 16 February 2015. Although it seems his destination was and place of residence is China, in truth one can by no means be certain that he remains in that vast and populous nation.
	
	
	The solicitor for the plaintiff has invited my attention to s 49(1)(e) of the Act, which speaks of the requirement that the plaintiff take “reasonable steps” to notify the defendant of this application. That phrase may be contrasted, she submitted, with the requirement that (for example) all possible steps be taken. She submitted that Parliament has mandated a test that strikes a balance of practicality.
	
	
	She also submitted that, as a matter of statutory interpretation founded upon reading the Act as a whole, s 49(1)(e) must be read in light of s 74 of the Act. She explained in short that, even if a forfeiture order were made by me today, it would not be irrevocable. In particular, pursuant to s 74(3)(a), if the defendant were able in due course to demonstrate that he had not, in truth, been effectively notified of this application, he may well be granted leave to reopen the question of forfeiture.
	
	
	Turning to my determination, I am satisfied that the plaintiff has taken reasonable steps to notify the defendant of the proceedings before me today.
	
	
	Accordingly, I consider it appropriate that the matter be heard ex parte.

      70042/03 REGINA v Rodney Ivan KERR 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 KIRBY J: Rodney Ivan Kerr was charged with the manslaughter of Christopher William Harris. Mr Harris died at the Redfern Railway Station on 27 October 2002. On 6 November 2003 a jury found Mr Kerr guilty of manslaughter. It remains for me to pass sentence. To do so I must first determine the facts relevant to the sentencing discretion. They must be determined in a manner consistent with the jury verdict. Where the facts are adverse, they must be established beyond reasonable doubt. Where they favour Mr Kerr, it is enough that they should be proved on the balance of probabilities. 
     
      
       
      The Incident 
       
      
    2 Mr Christopher Harris was in the habit of using the train. On the morning of 27 October 2002 he caught the train at Kings Cross Station. He intended to travel to Newtown. It was necessary for him to change trains at Redfern. Once at Redfern, he sat alone on the end seat of platform 7. 
     
      
    3 A train arrived on platform 7 at 12.45 pm. Mr Kerr was a passenger on that train. He alighted near Mr Harris. He was accompanied by his girlfriend, Ms Yvonne Sekope, and her friend, another young woman. Shortly after getting off the train Mr Kerr addressed Mr Harris, who remained seated. He said words to the effect: ""What the fuck are you staring at?"" As he said these words he moved towards Mr Harris. However, he was restrained by his girlfriend and the other young woman. 
     
      
    4 Mr Kerr then broke free of that restraint. Again he moved in the direction of Mr Harris. He repeated words to the effect: ""What the fuck are you staring at?"" Again he was physically restrained by the two women. 
     
      
    5 Mr Harris and Mr Kerr were perfect strangers. The attack was entirely unprovoked. Mr Harris had done nothing to excite the attention of Mr Kerr. He was sitting quietly on a suburban railway station, waiting for his train. He was wearing sunglasses. 
     
      
    6 Mr Harris did not respond to Mr Kerr's words. Rather, he got up and walked behind the railway seat and then to the edge of the platform. He looked towards the city, presumably checking that there were no trains coming from that direction. He then jumped down onto the track. 
     
      
    7 Mr Harris made his way directly across the tracks towards platform 5. As he did so, he looked back at Mr Kerr. A train was in fact approaching platform 5 from the opposite direction, that is, travelling towards the city. The driver saw Mr Harris. He sounded a long blast, termed a ""country horn"". At the same time the two women with Mr Kerr shouted out ""train"", attempting to warn Mr Harris. 
     
      
    8 Mr Harris responded by turning his body in a full circle. He then saw the train. In the agony of that moment he was called upon to make a split second decision. He ran directly across the path of the train, attempting to reach the safety of platform 5. He managed to place his hands on the platform, but was unable to pull himself up before the train was upon him. He was struck by the train and died almost at once. 
     
      
    9 The area where the incident took place was isolated. The stairs which provided an exit from the platform were at the other end. Like all suburban railway platforms, it was relatively narrow and elevated, an island surrounded by railway tracks. 
     
      
    10 Mr Kerr was, at this time, almost eighteen years old. He presented as a muscular young man. Mr Harris was forty-four years old. The jury were satisfied, as I am satisfied, that the actions of Mr Kerr were both unlawful and dangerous. They were an assault upon Mr Harris, engendering a well-founded apprehension of imminent physical violence. There was no-one nearby, apart from Mr Kerr's companions. The narrowness of the platform, its elevation and its proximity to the railway tracks added to the danger. It was reasonable and unsurprising that Mr Harris should have sought to escape. The jury, by its verdict, determined that crossing the tracks was a reasonable and proportionate response to the conduct of Mr Kerr, and the fear that it had engendered. 
     
      
    11 Nonetheless, it should be said that the incident was obviously unplanned. It was a spontaneous outburst on the part of Mr Kerr. He had no weapon. He did not actually touch Mr Harris. The closest he came to Mr Harris was about two metres. The whole episode was captured on the video surveillance maintained by the railway station. The video frames record the time. From beginning to end, that is from the time Mr Kerr got off the train, until the time the train struck Mr Harris, twenty-eight seconds elapsed. 
     
      
    12 Mr Kerr says that he personally did not foresee that Mr Harris would react in the way that he did. At the moment of the confrontation, he did not intend that Mr Harris should suffer grievous bodily harm, much less that he should be killed. He intended, by his aggression, to intimidate or frighten Mr Harris. I accept that these statements accurately represent Mr Kerr's state of mind. 
     
      
    13 At the time of this attack Mr Kerr was seriously affected by alcohol. He was also tired. He had been to a number of parties in the fifteen or so hours before the incident. He had consumed a significant quantity of alcohol, including spirits, beer and wine. The fact that Mr Kerr was drunk may be an explanation for his conduct. It plainly is not an excuse. 
     
      
    14 The incident received a good deal of publicity. Still photographs from the video surveillance appeared in a number of newspapers. There was an appeal by the police that those depicted should come forward. The female companions of Mr Kerr determined that they would do so. They spoke to Mr Kerr. He agreed to accompany them to the police. Mr Kerr was later interviewed by the police. The incident had occurred four days before his eighteenth birthday. He was still, at law, a child. The interview was therefore conducted in the presence of his father. Mr Kerr readily admitted his involvement. 
     
      
      Subjective case 
       
      
    15 Mr Kerr was born on 1 November 1984. He is now nineteen years old. Before this incident he had no involvement with the law. He has no previous convictions. At the trial and in the proceedings on sentence, a number of people spoke of his previous good character. He was not an aggressive or violent person. He was described as ""respectful to adults"". The incident occurred a few weeks after he left school. He was well regarded at school by those who knew him. He had been the captain of the school rugby league team. 
     
      
    16 Mr Kerr appears to have had a happy and stable childhood. He comes from a loving family. He still lives at home. His family has continued to support him after charges were laid. He was on bail before the trial and, indeed, that bail has continued until this day. The bail conditions included a curfew which he has observed. The conditions also required that he abstain from alcohol, which he has done with the assistance of his family. His family removed all alcohol from the house. 
     
      
    17 Mr Kerr appears to have recognised that he had a problem with alcohol and that his level of intoxication led him to display uncharacteristic aggression towards Mr Harris. 
     
      
    18 The support of his family, his conduct since being charged, and his change in attitude suggest that his prospects of rehabilitation are very good. Mr Kerr was referred to Mr W John Taylor, psychologist. Mr Taylor conducted a number of tests, investigating risk factors which may suggest the possibility of further offending behaviour. Mr Taylor concluded that there was ""a low likelihood"" of his offending again. 
     
      
    19 The same conclusion was reached by Ms Yvette Hanna, a Juvenile Justice counsellor, who prepared a helpful report. Ms Hanna said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Rodney's propensity for further offending behaviour would appear very low. Rodney has made successful changes to his alcohol consumption and there appear no other significant issues that would influence any further criminal behaviour. Rodney had not engaged in any criminal activity prior to the current offence and it is strongly believed that his ability to avoid any further offending is relatively high."" 
        
       
      
    20 I accept that Mr Kerr's prospects of rehabilitation are excellent. 
     
      
    21 Mr Kerr regrets his behaviour. He regrets that it led to the death of Mr Harris. He still has difficulty in accepting that his behaviour caused that death. He feels sorrow for the family of Mr Harris. There is therefore a measure of contrition, although by no means an acceptance of full responsibility. 
     
      
       
      The Sentence 
       
      
    22 The Crown has urged a custodial sentence in these circumstances. Manslaughter is plainly a serious crime. The maximum penalty fixed by statute is twenty five years imprisonment. The Crown drew attention to a number of cases in which young offenders affected by alcohol or drugs had been sentenced for manslaughter. The offender in each case was sentenced to a term of imprisonment. In some cases the terms imposed were quite lengthy. 
     
      
    23 Counsel for Mr Kerr drew attention to the unusual nature of the case. The behaviour of Mr Kerr was entirely out of character. Whilst he had behaved aggressively and unacceptably, such behaviour had extended over a period of twenty-eight seconds. In that short interval he had changed his life forever. Counsel drew attention to the assessment of the Juvenile Justice counsellor. Mr Kerr was considered suitable for a number of non-custodial options, including a suspended sentence, periodic detention, or community service. Counsel suggested that imprisonment, even within a juvenile detention centre, would not assist in his rehabilitation. Indeed, it is likely to retard his prospects of rehabilitation. Counsel drew attention to an important principle which the Court is required to have in mind when sentencing a young offender. The principle was expressed by Gleeson CJ in these words (see R v G D P (1991) 53 A Crim R 112 at 116): 
     
      
       
        
        "" ... in sentencing young people ... the consideration of general deterrence is not as important as it would be in the case of sentencing an adult and considerations of rehabilitation should always be regarded as very important indeed."" 
        
       
      
    24 I have given anxious consideration to each of these matters. Mr Kerr's crime involved the death of another human being. I have been furnished with a victim impact statement by Mr Ian McLaughlin, the partner of Mr Harris, and a further statement read to the Court by Ms Roseanna North, Mr Harris' sister. Both are moving documents. Both record the gentle and loving nature of Mr Harris and the anguish of those who grieve his death. I must, of course, deal with such material in a manner consistent with R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 at 85. 
     
      
    25 Limited assistance is provided by other cases, where inevitably the circumstances were different. The starting point in determining an appropriate sentence was stated by this Court (Gleeson CJ, Kirby P and Hunt CJ at CL) in R v MacDonald (unreported, CCA, 12.12.95) in these words: 
     
      
       
        
        ""In a case such as the present, it is important to bear in mind the denunciatory role of sentencing. Manslaughter involves the felonious taking of human life. This may involve a wide variety of circumstances calling for a wide variety of penal consequences. Even so, unlawful homicide, whatever form it takes, has always been recognised by the law as a most serious crime. (See  
        R v Hill 
         (1981) 3 A Crim R 397 at 402) The protection of human life and personal safety is a primary objective of the system of criminal justice. The value which the community places upon human life is reflected in its expectations of that system."" 
        
       
      
    26 Here an ordinary citizen, minding his own business, was repeatedly abused and threatened with physical violence, such that he felt constrained to take the extreme step of crossing the railway tracks to escape. In doing so he lost his life. In these circumstances I must impose a custodial sentence. The youth of the offender, the fact that he has not previously been in custody, and the enhancement of his prospects of rehabilitation make it appropriate that the sentence should be served in a Juvenile Detention Centre. I make a finding of special circumstances under s19 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. For many of the same reasons, I believe it is also appropriate to find special circumstances under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, and to vary the statutory ratio between the head sentence and the non parole period. 
     
      
    27 RODNEY IVAN KERR, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of 3 years to commence from today, 24 February 2004, and to expire on 23 February 2007, with a non parole period of 12 months. You will be released to parole on 23 February 2005.

     DALTON 
      
     JUDGMENT 
    1. SANTOW JA: I agree with Smart AJ2. HISLOP J: I agree with Smart AJ.3. SMART AJ: The Director of Public Prosecutions appeals against a sentence of 7 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years 3 months imposed upon the offender on a charge of manslaughter of the male child of his de facto to which he had pleaded guilty. The agreed basis of the plea was that the offender caused the child's death by an unlawful and dangerous act. The Director contends that the sentence is manifestly inadequate. 4. In January 2002 the offender, then aged 18, and AK, then aged 17, were living together in a flat at Casino in a de facto relationship with AK's two children, a male child born 23 January 2000 and almost two years of age, and a female baby born on 26 November 2001. The male child's natural father was serving a prison sentence in Queensland.5. The mother and the offender both lied to the police when they were interviewed on 17 January 2002, the day of the infliction of the fatal injuries and the day of the admission of the child to hospital. Eventually, on 22 July 2003, the mother told the police in detail of the events immediately leading up to the ultimately fatal injury to the child. The mother was in the laundry and heard the child screaming. She ran into his bedroom: 
     
      
       
        ""I ran in there and saw DJ [the offender] had him up on the window sill holding him by the shoulders. DJ wanted him to jump and he would let go of him. DJ said, 'I want him to jump.' I said, 'Can't you see he's scared, he's shaking.' [The child] started screaming louder and DJH grabbed his head and just pushed it into the window, just the once, he pushed him backwards into the window. I went over to grab [the child] but DJ pushed me away. When he pushed [the child's] head into the window he used two hands, he grabbed him over the ears and just thrust his head back against the window, it was just too quick. It was loud but the window didn't smash or crack. He then took him off and chucked him on the mattress. It was a forceful chuck. He chucked him on his back and his head was on the edge."" 
       
      
    6. The child lost consciousness immediately after that.7. The child was admitted to Casino Hospital just after 3.30pm on 17 January 2002. He was still unconscious. The admitting doctor concluded that the child had been ""violently assaulted and was probably going to die from his brain stem injury"". The child was transferred to Lismore Base Hospital where Dr C Gavaghan, the Director of Accident and Emergency, noted bruising on the right side of the child's face in the form of three circular bruises in a row between the right eye and the mouth which were black in colour and measured under two centimetres each. There was evidence of retinal haemorrhages in both eyes and haemorrhages behind the left and right tympanic membranes of the ears, symptomatic of accelerative brain injury. There were a number of other small older bruises over the chest wall. The child had significant bleeding in his brain. A skeletal survey revealed multiple arm fractures of different ages in the left arm and an old fracture in the right arm. There was a clearly visible fracture of the left wrist. Dr Gavaghan thought that ""the child was most likely subjected to continuous abuse over a prolonged period of time and this is evidenced in his skeletal survey and his general nutritional state.""8. The child was placed on life support in the Intensive Care Unit. He died about 10.50am on 18 January 2002.9. The post mortem examination disclosed bruises over the child's body, especially the face, chest, right forearm and right thigh, head injuries, spinal injuries and fractures of different ages. He concluded that the injuries were indicative of non-accidental injury and that the cause of death was head and possibly spinal injuries.10. Dr Kieran Moran, the Director of the Child Protection Unit, Sydney Children's Hospital, was consulted by police and reported:  ""The child died as a result of abusive head trauma and that he had been severely abused prior to the fatal incident. It is likely that he suffered a variety of severe impacts to the head during the fatal assault.""11. In his evidence in the committal proceedings on 14 February 2003 Dr Moran stated that the fatal injury could have occurred as a result of an extremely severe acceleration against a soft surface such as a mattress which included a whip-lashing movement to the head. He agreed that a male taking hold of a child and throwing it with great force and power onto a mattress on the floor could have caused the fatal injury.12. There is a considerable body of evidence that prior to 17 January 2002 the offender smacked the child excessively, dragged the child by the arm, lifted him by one arm and smacked him, hit him on the head with an open hand, on some occasions causing him to fall heavily on the ground and force-fed the child by taking hold of his mouth and forcing him to chew. The offender was not charged with any of these acts. Before the offender, the mother and the child moved into their flat he was spoken to by his mother and sister and others about his treatment of the child.13. The mother of the child said that the offender became more violent towards the child after they moved into their flat. She said that one way or the other the offender was violent towards the child every day. He threatened her that if she told DOCS about what was happening they would take the child away from her and she was scared this might happen. They would often argue. The situation became worse and despite her pregnant condition, the offender started to push the mother when she went to pick up the child, though mainly he just threatened her.14. The judge expressly reminded himself that the offender was to be sentenced for manslaughter alone and that he had not been charged with any of the other acts mentioned. The judge held that the relevance of these other acts was to demonstrate that the violence of 17 January 2002 was not isolated, it was not accidental and it was not momentary. It was the culmination of continued physical abuse. 15. The offender in his evidence, expressed his sorrow for what had happened but the judge very much doubted that this was deeply felt. The judge wondered whether his impression reflected the offender's difficulty with expressing emotion other than anger.16. Dr Brendan Lloyd, psychologist, interviewed the offender for 1 hour 37 minutes at Grafton Gaol. He also read the facts prepared for the Court and the mother's statement of 22 July 2002. The offender verified the history which he gave Dr Lloyd.17. The offender described himself as having a ""short fuse"" and easily aroused into anger. He said that he found it hard to calm down once he is aroused into anger.18. The offender experienced a disadvantaged and disruptive childhood. His natural father beat him with jug cords and fan belts. His mother was the victim of violent domestic abuse at the hands of his father. The family moved around a lot. His mother provided food and comfort for the children and cared for them. His father drank a lot and was frequently absent. His mother left his father when the offender was about five. When the offender was about eight, his mother met a man who was called ""Steve"" and lived with him. The offender said that Steve was kind to him, but it seems that there was inadequate discipline in the home. The offender's early teens were a mixture of trouble and attempts to participate in life generally.19. The offender was much affected by the death of his elder brother, Colin, after his release from Grafton Gaol in what the offender believed were suspicious circumstances and the deaths of a substantial number of other relatives.20. The offender described his mid to late teens as a time largely dedicated to marijuana and alcohol. From the time he left school around 16 to the time of his arrest on 10 September 2002, he fell into a pattern of daily use.21. Dr Lloyd recorded that the offender had a history of self-harming. In response to racial vilification, especially at school, towards himself and his sisters he was prone to run into walls with the deliberate intention of causing harm to himself. Now he is prone to punching brick walls, including those in gaol. The offender complains of arthritis in his hands as a consequence.22. Dr Lloyd reported that the offender was ""on protection"" in gaol due to the danger he faces from other prisoners. This has resulted in less opportunities for exercise and education.23. Dr Lloyd thought that the offender possessed a little higher than average intelligence. A more detailed psychometric assessment was needed to reveal the full extent of his capabilities.24. Dr Lloyd diagnosed the offender as suffering from a Borderline Personality Disorder. This is difficult to manage and requires prolonged and highly skilled treatment with at least 12 months of weekly contact. Dr Lloyd described in detail what is involved in such treatment. It is not always successful. Dr Lloyd believed, ""a mandated treatment program has a strong potential for helping Mr Dalton back into the world at large"".25. Dr Lloyd wrote that if there was progress during the period of intense treatment of 12 months, the frequency of the sessions could be reduced. He concluded, ""I would estimate that four years to follow up would be a minimum. I would hope this would translate into four years of psychotherapy and support to make a personality change in Dennis.""26. Dr Lloyd sounds this unsettling note of warning:  
     
      
       
        ""Without a therapeutic intervention, should Dennis find himself in a similar situation in the future, it is likely that within a year the pattern of abuse will be back. He might learn from this current experience and the harm he could inflict in the future may not be as lethal, but it will be nonetheless damaging physically and psychologically."" 
       
      
    27. The judge referred to the ""undoubted immaturity"" of the applicant, a fact which the judge was able to assess from hearing and seeing the offender give evidence. This advantage was also important in his forming the view ""that the offender did not realise the serious potential for grave injury that his actions caused"".28. The judge said: 
     
      
       
        ""It is important in the context of this case to give weight to the fact that the offender is Aboriginal and hence part of a marginalised community which, in his case, I think has contributed significantly to his own feelings of inadequacy and self-hatred to which Dr Lloyd has referred: see  
       R v Fernando  
       (1992) 76 A Crim R 58."" 
       
      
    29. The judge regarded the relative youth of the offender as ""a most significant factor"" and pointed to the ""great importance of rehabilitation in this particular case."" He held that ""objectively, the offence was a very serious one"" and that the offender ""was well aware that his actions were criminal assaults, quite capable of causing painful injuries, to which he was apparently angrily indifferent."" The judge added, ""I think he still feels that the child's death at his hands was accidental; this might merely be a mark of the offender's relative immaturity"".30. The judge concluded: 
     
      
       
        ""I have reluctantly concluded that the circumstances of the offender's crime are so serious that I am bound to impose a term of imprisonment which will result in the offender serving some more time in prison. Though unexpected, a small child was killed by the offender's act of deliberate cruelty, an act which he knew to be wrong and of a kind which he had been told on many occasions he should not commit."" 
       
      
    31. The judge held that the relative youth of the offender and his psychological dysfunction must qualify the application of the element of general deterrence.32. The judge stated: 
     
      
       
        ""…the offender has been in custody since 10 September 2002. He has spent most of that time in special protection and will continue to do so. Moreover, the conditions of imprisonment whilst on remand are significantly more harsh than ordinary imprisonment, so that merely to backdate the sentence is an inadequate adjustment. This is an important factor which requires an allowance to be made in the term still to be served. There are, as is obvious, special circumstances that justify a departure from the statutory calculus in s44 of the  
       Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
       , primarily to enable a lengthy period of supervision and support after the offender's release. I have taken into account the offender's expression of contrition in addition to the utilitarian discount."" 
       
      
    33. The judge granted a discount in the order of 10 per cent for the plea of guilty which came on the verge of the commencement of the offender's trial. The judge held that the utilitarian value of the plea was not great and that in addition to avoiding the expense of a trial its main virtue was that it avoided the mother having to give evidence.34. The judge was faced with a difficult sentencing exercise in a tragic case.35. The Crown's principal ground of appeal was that on the facts of this case the sentence was so inadequate as itself to bespeak error. The Crown further submitted that there were identifiable errors and I shall deal with each of these alleged errors.(a) His Honour erred in treating the mens rea requited for manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act as a mitigating feature of the case.36. I doubt if this formulation of the ground accurately reflected the Crown's contentions. The Crown submitted that the judge  
     
      
      (i) regarded the lack of an intention to kill or commit grievous bodily harm (the mens rea for murder) as a matter lessening the objective seriousness of the offence of manslaughter in this case; 
       
      (ii) qualified his assessment of the objective seriousness by reason of this fact and said he was reluctant to impose a term of imprisonment. 
       
      
    37. Manslaughter by an unlawful dangerous act does not require an intention to kill or commit grievous bodily harm. What is required is proof of an intention to commit the unlawful and dangerous act and proof that a reasonable person in the position of the accused would have realised that he was exposing the victim to an appreciable risk of serious injury.38. The Crown contended that the judge erred in treating the offender's belief that the death was accidental as a mitigating feature and in the weight he gave to this factor. The Crown relied on the offender having been warned on at least one occasion of the risk of such injury to the child by reason of one of his assaults.39. On a fair reading of the judge's remarks none of these complaints is justified. The judge at no stage said expressly or by implication that the lack of an intention to kill or commit grievous bodily harm lessened the objective seriousness of the manslaughter. The judge specifically acknowledged the seriousness of the offence.40. The judge's comment that, though unexpected, a small child was killed by the offender's act of deliberate cruelty, an act which he knew to be wrong and of a kind he had been told on many occasions he should not commit reflected the factual position. By ""unexpected"" the judge means unexpected by the offender. It is an impermissible jump to say that the judge, by the use of the words ""though unexpected"" was lessening the seriousness of the offence. Nor do I accept that the judge in referring to the offender's belief that the death was accidental treated that as a mitigating feature. In the context the judge was pointing out that the applicant did not realise the serious potential of his acts and therefore regarded what happened as accidental. In making this remark the judge probably also had in mind Dr Lloyd's report and the difficult task of rehabilitation which lay ahead.41. The Crown's submissions read too much into the judge's remarks. These submissions should be rejected.(b) His Honour Failed to Impose a Sentence That Reflected the Objective Seriousness of the offence.42. This complaint is essentially one of manifest inadequacy and is better dealt with under the principal ground.(c) The Fernando Principles43. The Crown contended that the judge misapplied the principles enunciated in R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58 in that the judge had treated the offender's aboriginality as requiring mitigation of the sentence with proof of nothing further relating his race to the commission of the offence.44. The judge was not relying solely on the offender's Aboriginality. He was relying on the offender's Aboriginality, the race vilification he experienced at school and the effect that that had had upon the offender as detailed by Dr Lloyd. That vilification followed on the childhood experiences of the offender briefly summarised earlier. In combination these factors had led, at least in part, to Borderline Personality Disorder.45. Dr Lloyd was relying on principles formulated by Dr Linehan in his published works, Skills Training for Treating Borderline Personality Disorder and Cognitive Behavioural Treatment of Borderline Personality Disorder, the Guildford Press New York. Dr Lloyd applied those principles to this case when he wrote: 
     
      
       
        ""Deemed self invalidation. Dennis' early childhood experiences were fragmented invalidating and dangerous. All through his childhood he experienced racial vilification at school."" 
       
      
    46. Dr Lloyd expressed the view that the conduct of the offender towards the child, namely, the months of physical harm, with the harm becoming lethal for the child, ""describes a set pattern of behaviour that contributes to describing Dennis' personality"". Dr Lloyd saw the racial vilification as playing a part in the onset of the Borderline Personality Disorder.47. The judge did not deal with the matter in the detail set out earlier in these reasons, but his reference to the offender's aboriginality and Dr Lloyd's assessment encompassed that.48. This is not a case of the misapplication of the Fernando principles as further explained in R v Morgan (2003) 57 NSWLR 533 and R v Newman, R v Simpson [2004] NSWCCA 102, but a development of them to meet a different factual situation. This complaint should be rejected. 
     (d) Failure to Take Into Account As An Aggravating Feature That the Offender was on a Good Behaviour Bond at the Time of the Commission of the Offence.49 .The Crown accepted that the offender was not on a bond at the time the offence was committed. This complaint fails. (e) His Honour failed to fix a non-parole period that adequately reflected the seriousness of the offence.50. The Crown pointed out that the adjustment for special circumstances involved a reduction in the non-parole period from the standard ratio of 75 per cent to 46.4 per cent of the total sentence. The Crown submitted that by so varying the statutory proportions the judge has compounded the undue leniency of the head sentence by arriving at a wholly inadequate non-parole period that does not reflect the seriousness of the offence. The Crown submitted that there had been double counting for matters already taken into account in reducing the head sentence and therefore reflected in the standard non-parole period.51. The Crown complained that the judge referred to the ""obvious"" special circumstances without identifying anything other than the desire for a lengthy period of post release supervision. The Crown conceded that the judge had earlier referred to the youth of the offender as requiring both amelioration of the sentence and a structure that would encourage rehabilitation. The Crown contended that the standard statutory ratio would have provided an adequate period of post release supervision on parole and that the non-parole period fixed did not adequately give expression to the need for general and specific deterrence.52. The Crown submissions overlook the terms of Dr Lloyd's report which the judge accepted. Dr Lloyd envisaged intensive treatment for one year and treatment extending over a further four years. The intensive and highly skilled and specialised treatment Dr Lloyd regarded as necessary may well not be available in gaol. If that is so and Dr Lloyd is correct as to the level of treatment needed, not a great deal of rehabilitation may take place in gaol. It would be surprising if the offender was able to afford the level of treatment deemed necessary by Dr Lloyd. I am not aware whether that treatment could be otherwise funded. These questions were not raised at the sentencing hearing. The prospect of the offender not receiving the treatment he needs is disturbing. Dr Lloyd's report, if substantially accepted, warranted a major extension of the period on parole and a corresponding reduction in the non-parole period.53. The ultimate question of whether the judge failed to fix a non-parole period that adequately reflected the seriousness of the offence is better dealt with under the general ground that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. (f) His Honour gave too much weight to the subjective circumstances of the offender.54. It is a fundamental rule that a sentencing judge should not permit the subjective features of a particular offender to overshadow the seriousness of the offence. The Crown complained that the judge placed too much weight on the offender's youth and immaturity and failed to appreciate sufficiently that the offender was living as an adult in a de facto relationship and was in a position of trust in respect of a small child.55. It was pointed out that the offender fled following the offence, and initially lied to police about his involvement. The Crown submitted that there was little by way of contrition to ameliorate the sentence, that the conduct culminating in the offence was deliberate and sustained, despite warnings from others.56. These are also matters better dealt with under the general ground that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. (g) His Honour failed to comply with s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999  in that he failed to firstly set out the full term of the sentence, and secondly to set a non-parole period.57. The Crown submitted that the judge had sentenced the offender in accordance with s 44 of that Act as it stood at the date of sentencing, whereas in that form s 44 applied to offences committed on and after 1 February 2003. The current form of s 44 was introduced by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Standard Minimum Sentencing) Act 2002. The Crown contended that the offender should have been sentenced in accordance with s 44 as enacted in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Under the legislation the offender fell to be sentenced under s 44 as enacted in 1999, the offence being committed in January 2002.58. Under s 44 as enacted in 1999 the Court is required to set the term of the sentence and secondly to set a non-parole period for the sentence (the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention). Under the amended s 44 the Court is first required to set a non-parole period for the sentence (the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention) and the balance of the term must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period. In each instance the Court is empowered to vary the ratio if there are special circumstances.59. Adams J said: 
     
      ""Dennis Dalton, you are sentenced to serve a minimum term of imprisonment of three years and three months from 10 September 2002 so that you will be eligible to be released on parole on 9 December 2005. The balance of the term of seven years imprisonment will expire on 9 September 2009 …"" 
    60. It does not follow that, because the judge in his formal sentence announced the minimum term first followed in the next sentence by the length of the full term of the sentence, he did not firstly set the term of the sentence. The use by the judge of the phrase ""minimum term"" rather than ""non-parole period"" was a slip and reflects the words in parenthesis in the legislation.61. This is not a point that has any practical importance. The minimum period that the offender has to spend in gaol has been specified as have the first date on which he is eligible for release on parole and the length of the full term of the sentence.62. This point is one of form and would not of itself lead to any alteration of substance to the sentence. The Principal Ground of Appeal – Manifest Inadequacy.63. The protection of children is of fundamental importance to society (R v Howard [2001] NSWCCA 309 at [18] per Wood CJ at CL. In crimes against young children heavy sentences reflecting the need for severe punishment are required: R v Ditford, unrep 17 March 1992 per Hunt CJ at CL. The law attaches great importance to the sanctity of human life. The Crown correctly contended that the sentence imposed does not reflect any of these long-established principles.64. The Crown submitted that on any test of objective seriousness this offence was in the most serious category of manslaughter as it involved sustained and gratuitous cruelty to the child. This was not a case of momentary loss of control or error of judgment.65. It was also pointed out that the non-parole period must itself appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence.66. The youth and immaturity of the offender are matters of importance as was his borderline personality disorder which was at least in part contributed to by his disrupted and disadvantaged childhood and the racial vilification endured. The offender was of not less than average intelligence. He had been warned against ill-treating this young child. Even as an immature 18 year old he was aware that his conduct was capable of severely injuring the young child, especially on the morning of 17 January 2002. Any reasonable person would have realised this. His actions were deliberate and the child was not in a position where he could effectively resist the offender's actions.67. The offender had a strong subjective case but his criminality was grave.68. Both the full sentence and the non-parole period (or minimum term) were manifestly inadequate. There is no sufficient reason why this Court should not re-sentence. I have not overlooked that the offender was sentenced in April 2004 and is due to be released in December 2005. This was a very grave crime.69. The offender is entitled to the discount in the order of 10 per cent allowed by the judge. His powerful subjective features must be and are taken into account. Any re-sentencing must be approached with the restraint which is appropriate to Crown Appeals.70. It is also important to take into account that the applicant has served and will serve his sentence on strict protection. This is more arduous. Further, the applicant's affidavit of 20 September 2004 points out the limited education facilities which are available in practice and the limited activities and amenities actually available. The offender has found it hard to get a job in strict protection. He tells of a memory loss he has suffered and the consequent trouble he has had with reading, writing and spelling. He has not seen the psychologist. It is not stated why this has occurred. The offender may need help to enlist the psychologist's services. He probably needs specialist psychological services.71. There are special circumstances. The offender is going to need skilled and extended treatment as outlined by Dr Lloyd and he will need support and supervision. I doubt if treatment of the length, regularity and quality required will be available in gaol. Rehabilitation will be long and difficult but essential for the community if the offender is to overcome or cope with his borderline personality disorder. 72. This Court should proceed under the original form of s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedures) Act when re-sentencing as the offence occurred prior to 1 February 2003.73. The offender should be sentenced to a full term of imprisonment of 9 years with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months.74. I propose the following orders: 
     
      
      1. Crown appeal against sentence allowed. 
       
       
      2. In lieu of the sentence imposed the offender (Dennis James Dalton) is sentenced to imprisonment for 9 years commencing on 10 September 2002 with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months expiring on 9 March 2007 on which day the applicant will become eligible for release on parole, which should be under the supervision and control of the Adult Probation Service.  
       
       
      3. Direct that a copy of Dr Lloyd's report accompany the warrant to the Corrective Service Authorities.

2422415,JC v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2014] NSWCA 228,"Judgment
1BEAZLEY P:  I agree with Basten JA.
2BASTEN JA:  The applicants seek to set aside a judgment of the District Court dismissing their claim for a certificate under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967 (NSW) (""the Costs Act"").
3In December 2011 four young persons (the applicants and one other) were charged with sexual offences under the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  On 19 January 2012 they appeared before the Children's Court at Parramatta.  On 31 May 2012 they were committed for a trial in the Parramatta District Court.  On 21 June 2012 they appeared before Judge Sides QC, on which occasion they were arraigned and entered pleas of not guilty to all charges.  The matter was fixed for hearing 26 November 2012.
4In late June, a ""no bill"" application was made to the Director.  On about 21 November 2012 the Director determined that the prosecution should be terminated.  When the matter came before Sides DCJ on 26 November 2012 the prosecutor advised the Court of that decision, with the result that the accused were not further arraigned before a jury panel. 
5Thereafter, the three applicants sought a certificate under the Costs Act, which would have entitled them to seek payment of their costs from consolidated revenue.  The application came before Armitage DCJ on 26 July 2013.  The application was dismissed on the basis that the Court had no jurisdiction to grant a certificate.  There is no right of appeal from such a judgment, but the applicants sought judicial review in this Court's supervisory jurisdiction, pursuant to s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW).  
Issues6The case turns on the proper construction of s 2 of the Costs Act which, in November 2012, read (as it still does): 
2 Certificate may be granted
(1) The Court or Judge or Magistrate in any proceedings relating to any offence, whether punishable summarily or upon indictment, may:
(a) where, after the commencement of a trial in the proceedings, a defendant is acquitted or discharged in relation to the offence concerned, or a direction is given by the Director of Public Prosecutions that no further proceedings be taken, or(b) where, on appeal, the conviction of the defendant is quashed and:
(i) the defendant is discharged as to the indictment upon which he or she was convicted, or(ii) the information or complaint upon which the defendant was convicted is dismissed,
grant to that defendant a certificate under this Act, specifying the matters referred to in section 3 and relating to those proceedings.
(2) For the avoidance of doubt, a certificate may be granted in accordance with subsection (1)(a) following an acquittal or discharge of a defendant at any time during a trial, whether a hearing on the merits of the proceedings has occurred or not.
(3) In this section, trial, in relation to proceedings, includes a special hearing conducted under section 19 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 and also includes preliminary proceedings that form part of the trial, for example, a voir dire.
7The short point raised by the present application is whether the decision by the Director that no further proceedings be taken was made ""after the commencement of a trial in the proceedings"".  
8The Director submitted that the word ""trial"" had an ordinary meaning with respect to a criminal offence tried on an indictment, namely the hearing at which a jury was empanelled and witnesses called.  That was said to accord with the common law, in the absence of any relevant statutory provision: Donaldson v State of Western Australia [2005] WASCA 196; 31 WAR 122 at [41] (Roberts-Smith JA).  However, as the cases discussed in Donaldson at [42]-[60] demonstrate, the question rarely arose under the common law, at least in modern times, but rather has involved the application of legislation.  Thus, the question has arisen with respect to legislation permitting majority verdicts, abolishing the right of an accused to give unsworn evidence and changing the rules with respect to jury directions. 
9The applicants, on the other hand, contended that a trial commenced when a person committed for trial, with respect to whom an indictment had been presented, was arraigned and pleaded not guilty.  This conclusion flowed, it was submitted, from the statutory scheme of the Costs Act, read in the context provided by the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). 
10The applicants and the Director were on common ground in two respects.  First, each accepted that the question was ultimately one of statutory construction; secondly, there was no authoritative decision of this Court (or the High Court) resolving the issue.
11The present language of the Costs Act owes much to its legislative history, in the course of which amendments have been made for specific purposes and in language which has not always been chosen with attention to the scope of the provision, but rather with an eye firmly fixed on a specific problem to be resolved.  Nevertheless, it is preferable to start with the current form of s 2 before turning to its predecessors.  Further, before turning to the elements in s 2 central for present purposes, it is convenient to identify the purpose of the overall statutory scheme.  The proper approach was recently identified in the joint reasons of Crennan, Bell, Gageler and Keane JJ in Plaintiff S297-2013 v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [2014] HCA 24 at [25] (albeit in relation to provisions in the Migration Act 1958 (Cth)):
""The numerous amendments that have been made to the Act form part of its legislative history and bear legitimately on its construction.  They are to be construed as part of the Act, so as to be read together 'as a combined statement of the will of the legislature'.  The timing of amendments might assist in determining the 'hierarchy' of apparently conflicting provisions of the Act as amended, but notions of 'implied repeal' have no place.""
The statutory scheme12There are provisions in the Criminal Procedure Act which allow for an award of costs in criminal proceedings.  Such orders are made against the unsuccessful party.  The grant of a certificate under the Costs Act is different: it involves the expression of an opinion by a judge or magistrate, on the basis of which the Director-General may, on application, make a payment out of consolidated revenue with respect to costs incurred in the proceedings by the party to whom the certificate was granted: s 4(1).  The opinion to be expressed in the certificate is two-fold, as provided in s 3:
3 Form of certificate
(1) A certificate granted under this Act shall specify that, in the opinion of the Court or Judge or Magistrate granting the certificate:
(a) if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, been in possession of evidence of all the relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings, and(b) that any act or omission of the defendant that contributed, or might have contributed, to the institution or continuation of the proceedings was reasonable in the circumstances.
13Turning to the language of s 2, the applicants relied on two related aspects of subss (2) and (3).  First, they noted that in subs (2) a certificate could be granted following an acquittal or discharge at any time during a trial, ""whether a hearing on the merits of the proceedings has occurred or not.""  Further, they noted that the inclusive definition of ""trial"" in subs (3) included ""preliminary proceedings that form part of the trial, for example, a voir dire.""
14In the applicants' submission, in order to comprehend the scope of this legislative scheme, it was important to note the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act which permitted ""preliminary proceedings"", such as a voir dire, to occur after the person charged was first arraigned and before a jury was empanelled.  
15For this purpose, one aspect of the general law should be noted.  In Jago v District Court of New South Wales [1989] HCA 46; 168 CLR 23 (a case involving the power of a trial court to stay proceedings for delay) Brennan J noted at 36:
""Absent any special statutory investiture, the District Court has no jurisdiction in a criminal matter prior to the presentation of an indictment.""
16As the Court of Criminal Appeal noted in KS v Veitch [2012] NSWCCA 186; 300 ALR 181 at [17], an indictment is presented by filing it with the Registrar of the Court: Criminal Procedure Act, s 127; District Court Rules 1973 (NSW), Pt 53, r 10D.  Practices have varied with respect to the point at which an accused named in an indictment is arraigned: see R v Howard (1992) 29 NSWLR 242 at 247 (Gleeson CJ, Sheller JA and Lee AJ).  However, arraignment involves a court proceeding in which an indictment is read to the accused and he or she is asked to plead guilty or not guilty.  The effect of a not guilty plea is provided in s 154 of the Criminal Procedure Act:
154 Plea of ""not guilty""
If an accused person arraigned on an indictment pleads ""not guilty"", the accused person is taken to have put himself or herself on the country for trial, and the court is to order a jury for trial accordingly.
17In R v Nicolaidis (1994) 33 NSWLR 364 at 367, Gleeson CJ, after setting out the terms of s 395 of the Crimes Act (the predecessor to s 154 of the Criminal Procedure Act), stated:
""The arraignment marks the commencement of a trial by jury.  Persons who are tried in the District Court for indictable offences are formally arraigned, in the presence of the jurors in waiting, and immediately before the jury is empanelled. Of course, a jury will only be empanelled if the plea is one of not guilty.
Notwithstanding the procedure of arraignment that takes place at the commencement of a trial, it is ... the practice in the District Court for persons charged with indictable offences to be arraigned within a relatively short time after having been committed for trial and sometimes many weeks or even months in advance of the hearing date of the trial.  In such cases, assuming the accused adhered to a plea of not guilty, there would be at least two, and perhaps more, arraignments, the last being at the commencement of the trial. ...  No doubt one of the reasons for the procedure of early arraignment after committal is to permit the District Court to take early control of cases for the purpose of pre-trial management: cf Jago v District Court of New South Wales ... at 37 and note the provisions of Pt 53 of the District Court Rules 1973.""
(Nicolaidis involved the operation of s 53 of the Criminal Procedure Act, as in force in 1992, which provided for a ""sentence indication hearing"" which could be sought by an accused ""before or at arraignment"": the reference was held to be to the first arraignment.)
18In TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124 the appellant attempted to establish that a miscarriage of justice had occurred because trial counsel for the accused had failed to obtain ""an advance ruling"" from the trial judge as to the effect of leading character evidence in the defence case.  Reliance was placed upon Pt 53, rr 10 and 11 of the District Court Rules to support the availability of such a procedure.  Rule 10 empowered the court to make interlocutory orders prior to ""the day appointed for the hearing"" and further provided that, where practicable, application for such  orders should be made before that day.  TKWJ was understood to cast doubt on the power of the court to make 'advance rulings' binding on the trial judge. 
19The jurisdiction and powers of the court after presentation of an indictment are now found in s 130 of the Criminal Procedure Act, in the following terms:
130 Trial proceedings after presentation of indictment and before empanelment of jury
(1) In this section, court means the Supreme Court or District Court.
(2) The court has jurisdiction with respect to the conduct of proceedings on indictment as soon as the indictment is presented and the accused person is arraigned, and any orders that may be made by the court for the purposes of the trial in the absence of a jury may be made before a jury is empanelled for the trial.
(3) If proceedings are held for the purpose of making any such orders after the indictment is presented to commence the trial and before the jury is empanelled:
(a) the proceedings are part of the trial of the accused person, and(b) the accused person is to be arraigned again on the indictment when the jury is empanelled for the continuation of the trial.
20Section 130 began as s 19 of the Criminal Procedure Act, with effect from 4 January 1998: Crimes Legislation Amendment (Procedure) Act 1997 (NSW), Sch 2 [2]; Government Gazette, No 1, 2 January 1998, p 3.  The precise scope and operation of the provision may not have been fully considered at the trial (in May 1998) of the matter which came to the High Court as TKWJ.  There was no reference to that provision in the appeal judgments.  In any event, a new provision, s 130A, was inserted in the Criminal Procedure Act commencing on 1 December 2005, providing that in respect of prescribed sexual offences a ""pre-trial order"" made by a judge is binding on the trial judge unless the latter forms the opinion that it would not be in the interests of justice for the order to be binding: Criminal Procedure Amendment (Sexual Offence Case Management) Act 2005 (NSW), Sch 1 [1].  Commencing on 1 February 2010, s 130A was amended to make it generally applicable in criminal proceedings: Criminal Procedure Amendment (Case Management) Act 2009 (NSW), Sch 1 [3].  (See also new s 192A of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), introduced by the Evidence Amendment Act 2007 (NSW), Sch 1 [77].)
Commencement of trial on indictment21Arraignment for the purpose of taking a plea will determine whether the accused is to go to trial.  The effect of a 'not guilty' plea is thus to require an order for a jury trial: s 154.  That trial will be before a jury, absent a specific order for a trial by judge alone: Criminal Procedure Act, ss 131 and 132.  On one view, absent statutory provision to the contrary, the trial would not be thought to commence at that point, although there are statements in the cases to the effect that arraignment will mark the start of a trial on the charges alleged in the indictment: see, eg, PM v The Queen [2007] HCA 49; 232 CLR 370 at [38].  However, that statement was made with respect to an indictment to which a plea was taken immediately preceding the empanelling of a jury: at [13].  It is thus not decisive on the effect of an earlier arraignment.
22On the other hand, there is long standing authority for the proposition that a trial may commence on the date of an accused's first arraignment before the court: Newell v The King [1936] HCA 50; 55 CLR 707 at 712 (Latham CJ and Dixon J), 713 (Evatt J).  It is true that the Criminal Code (Tas) in issue in that case contained a provision that ""[t]he trial shall be deemed to begin when the accused is called upon to plead"": s 351(6), set out in precise terms in Director of Public Prosecutions (SA) v B [1998] HCA 45; 194 CLR 566 at [16] (Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ).  The joint reasons in B then noted that there was ""no equivalent provision in South Australia.""  A footnote to the Tasmanian provision read, ""cf Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 395"".  The footnote also referred to equivalent provisions in Victoria and Queensland and to cases in those States and in Western Australia: there is little to be gained from a review of the legislative schemes in different jurisdictions.  That point is made by the joint reasons in B which, dealing with South Australian legislation, noted the statement by King CJ in Attorney-General's Reference No 1 of 1988 (1988) 49 SASR 1 at 5-6, that:
""In this State, therefore, the trial commences when the accused having been arraigned before the judge who is try him, that judge embarks upon the hearing and determination of any preliminary questions or upon the empanelling of the jury.""
23Having set out that passage at [15], the joint reasons then stated at [17]:
""It may be that the answer to the question - when does the trial begin - requires consideration of the context within which that question arises and does not admit of an answer of the generality given in Attorney-General's Reference No 1 of 1988.""
24Even the Tasmanian provision contained a latent ambiguity because an accused might be arraigned on more than one occasion and, at least in modern times, frequently is.  However, the question in Newell was whether a statutory amendment permitting majority verdicts applied to Mr Newell's trial in circumstances where he had entered his plea prior to the commencement of the legislation.  The Court held that, whether to be described as a procedural amendment or not, such a provision should not be given retrospective effect to vary a central feature of a criminal trial which had already begun.  The context thus provides a ready explanation of the decision.
25The submissions in this Court focused on the effect of s 130(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act.  That too, read in isolation, might be considered ambiguous.  Referring to orders made ""after the indictment is presented to commence the trial and before the jury is empanelled"" might refer only to the last arraignment immediately preceding the process of empanelling the jury.  However, it seems clear from subs (2) that orders may be made by the court ""for the purposes of the trial"" as soon as the indictment has been presented and the accused is arraigned (for the first time).  The phrase ""as soon as"", taken with the requirement that an indictment be presented within four weeks of committal for trial (s 129(2)) indicates that the making of orders referred to in s 130(2) is not limited to those immediately preceding the empanelling of a jury.  That purpose is reflected in the period identified in subs (3) which commences ""after the indictment is presented"" and by the reference back implicit in the phrase ""such orders"".  Accordingly, the statement that such proceedings form ""part of the trial"" indicates that the trial must commence prior to the arraignment before a jury, or before a pool of jurors waiting to be empanelled.
26The Director accepted this last conclusion, but submitted that it did not avail the applicants in the present case: there were no orders made by the Court for the purposes of the trial prior to the date fixed for hearing.  The position might have been different, the Director accepted, if there had been a voir dire or some other advance ruling, for example, pursuant to s 192A of the Evidence Act, as to the admissibility of evidence proposed to be adduced.  There was none, he submitted, in the present case.
27This submission should not be accepted, for two reasons.  First, the primary purpose of s 130(2) is to declare the point from which the court has jurisdiction with respect to ""the conduct of proceedings on indictment"".  As appeared from the reasoning of Brennan J in Jago, the point at which the Court has jurisdiction may be a matter of importance.  Thus in Jago (in 1989) Brennan J held that ""[t]he Criminal Procedure Act confers no power on the District Court to regulate any aspect of the exercise of the powers of prosecution before an indictment is presented"": at 37.  Indeed, he doubted the legal effect of listing a matter before presentation of the indictment.  According to that reasoning, absent presentation of an indictment and, in the terms of s 130, arraignment of the accused, the court may have no power to make an order fixing a date for trial.  One effect of such an order is to require that the accused, if on bail, attend at court on the day fixed.  Accordingly, s 130 should not be read in a restricted fashion as limited to orders relating to evidence or otherwise dealing with matters which could be dealt with in the course of a hearing, albeit in the absence of the jury.
28Secondly, if that is so, both taking a plea and fixing a date for trial involve proceedings and, in the latter case an order, falling within the scope of s 130.  Both steps were taken in the present case on 21 June 2012.  It follows that the proceedings on that date constituted ""part of the trial of the accused person"", pursuant to s 130(3).  
Operation of Costs Act, s 229That suggests that the applicants are entitled to succeed.  However, before reaching that conclusion it is necessary to address two further matters of construction.  First, as was accepted by the applicant, there are a number of provisions in the Criminal Procedure Act which use the term ""trial"" in a more limited sense and in contrast to ""pre-trial"" proceedings.  For example, s 130A refers to a ""pre-trial order"" that is ""binding on the trial judge"", subject to certain conditions.  A pre-trial order is defined to mean ""any order made after the indictment is first presented but before the empanelment of a jury for a trial"": s 130A(4).  Many case management provisions use similar terminology: see Ch 3, Pt 3, Div 3.  
30Secondly, it is necessary to consider the history of the Costs Act in order to determine whether some more limited reading should be given to the phrase ""the commencement of a trial"" in s 2(1)(a).  (It is convenient to consider the relevance of the provisions of the further Criminal Procedure Act after addressing this issue.)
31Since its enactment in 1967, the Costs Act has had two consistent elements, relevantly for present purposes.  First, it has applied to offences whether punishable summarily or upon indictment; secondly, it has applied where there is a successful outcome for the person charged, whether at trial or as a result of an appeal.  The first factor is of more significance for present purposes, because it requires that the language now found in s 2(1)(a) apply to summary proceedings, whether in the Local Court or the Supreme Court, and to proceedings dealt with on indictment, whether before a judge and jury or judge alone.
32As first enacted, the trial limb of s 2 applied where a defendant ""after a hearing on the merits, is acquitted or discharged as to the information then under inquiry"".  That language had two features which have changed.  First, it only operated where there had been a hearing on the merits; secondly, the language of discharge following an inquiry was apt to cover committal proceedings as well as trials.  The current language has been held not to apply to a committal proceeding: Director of Public Prosecutions v Howard [2005] NSWSC 987; 64 NSWLR 139 (Hoeben J).  
33In 2002, s 2 of the Costs Act was amended by the Courts Legislation Amendment Act 2001 (NSW), which commenced on 18 January 2002.  The existing s 2 became s 2(1) and two further subsections were added.  It is convenient to set out the relevant parts in full:
2 Certificate may be granted
(1) The Court or Judge or Justice or Justices in any proceedings relating to any offence, whether punishable summarily or upon indictment, may:
(a) where, after the commencement of a trial in the proceedings, a defendant is acquitted or discharged in relation to the offence concerned ...
grant to that defendant a certificate under this Act ....
(2) For the avoidance of doubt, a certificate may be granted in accordance with subsection (1)(a) following an acquittal or discharge of a defendant at any time during a trial, whether a hearing on the merits of the proceedings has occurred or not.
(3) In this section, trial, in relation to proceedings, includes preliminary proceedings that form part of the trial, for example, a voir dire.
34The scope of the power to grant a certificate was thus significantly expanded so that the relevant precondition was not the completion of a hearing on the merits, but rather the commencement of a trial in the proceedings, an important element of the current language.  The amendment, however, did not bring the relevant point in time back to the commencement of the proceedings.  This was clearly deliberate, as in s 3, since 1967, the opinion required to be specified in the certificate related to the reasonableness of instituting the proceedings if, ""before the proceedings were instituted"", the prosecution had had certain information.
35Accepting that the use of the term ""trial"" and the reference to ""proceedings ... in relation to the offence"" (in place of ""a hearing ... as to the information then under inquiry"") was designed to remove a power to grant a certificate with respect to committal proceedings, then the reference in subs (3) to ""preliminary proceedings that form part of the trial, for example, a voir dire"" would, consistently, exclude committal proceedings which do not form part of the trial on any view of that term.  The question remains as to what proceedings might properly fall within the description of ""preliminary proceedings that form part of the trial"".  
36The Costs Act cannot properly be construed without reference to the legislative scheme for the conduct of trials, both summary and on indictment: Sweeney v Fitzhardinge [1906] HCA 73; 4 CLR 716 at 726 (Griffith CJ); Certain Lloyd's Underwriters v Cross [2012] HCA 56; 248 CLR 378 at [96]-[97] (Kiefel J); State of New South Wales v Williamson [2012] HCA 57; 248 CLR 417 at [28]-[29] (French CJ and Hayne J).  Such cognate legislation was primarily the Criminal Procedure Act.
37It is not necessary to consider whether amendments to the Criminal Procedure Act which occurred after the introduction of the critical language in s 2 of the Costs Act might be relevant, on the basis that the Costs Act should be given an ambulatory effect, thus picking up variations in criminal procedure adopted after its enactment.  At the relevant date, the Criminal Procedure Act contained language which readily fitted within the terms of ss 2(2) and 2(3) of the Costs Act.  At that date s 130 (then s 19) of the Criminal Procedure Act dealt with proceedings which could clearly be described as ""preliminary proceedings"" and stated that those proceedings ""are part of the trial of the accused"": s 19(3)(a), now s 130(3)(a).
38A further amendment (the final amendment relevant for present purposes) was introduced by the Courts Legislation Miscellaneous Amendments Act 2002 (NSW), which commenced on 20 December 2002.  That amendment introduced a second limb in s 2(1)(a), by adding the words ""or a direction is given by the Director of Public Prosecutions that no further proceedings be taken"".  The purpose of this provision is evidently to permit a certificate to be granted where a prosecution does not proceed because the Director has made a decision that no further proceedings be taken.  (There may be uncertainty as to whether the decision relates to the offence charged, or the conduct the subject of the charge, but that is not presently in issue.)  
39The submissions of the parties proceeded on the basis that the second limb was in the alternative to the defendant being acquitted or discharged and thus was subject to the temporal requirement as to the commencement of a trial.  On that reading, the new words may have been by way of clarification rather than expansion: at least with respect to an indictable offence, the trial does not commence until the accused has been arraigned, after which, if the prosecution does not proceed, there must be a step involving the acquittal or discharge of the accused.  In any event, subject to the temporal condition, that language is apt to cover a decision taken by the Director not to prosecute, as occurred in the present case.  Accordingly, neither this amendment (nor any of the subsequent amendments) requires any variation of the conclusion that the definition of ""trial"" in s 2(3) was consistent with the language of what is now s 130(3) and thus s 2 applies with respect to the post-arraignment proceedings in the present case.
40Because it is the express language of s 130 which is to be found in the Costs Act, the fact that other provisions in the Criminal Procedure Act distinguish trial and pre-trial processes is not significant.  Indeed, it is the purpose (as the Director accepted) of s 130(3) to pick up such pre-trial orders as ""part of the trial"".  There is no reason to conclude that the language of the Costs Act, relevantly enacted after the introduction of s 130(3), was not intended to adopt the scheme of criminal proceedings then reflected in s 130.
Conclusions41It follows that the primary judge was in error in determining that he had no jurisdiction to grant a certificate under the Costs Act.  The applicants sought an order quashing that determination: that order should be made.  The applicants also sought an order in the nature of mandamus directing that the District Court, constituted by the primary judge, determine the application for a certificate.  There is no need for an order in that form as there is no reason to doubt that the application, which remains outstanding, will be dealt with by the District Court.  No doubt the applicants would favour a return of the matter to Judge Armitage on the basis that he is familiar with the circumstances of their cases and has indicated a tentative view in favour of granting a certificate had he the power to do so.
42Where there has been a hearing on the merits, it will often be desirable that an application under the Costs Act be dealt with by the judge before whom the matter was heard.  That consideration does not arise in the present case.  Nor were the circumstances of the hearing of the costs application such as to make it essential, or even desirable, for the efficient administration of justice, that the matter return to the primary judge.  Even were that circumstance established, the listing of the application in the District Court would properly be a matter for that Court and not for direction by this Court.  Further, the expression of preliminary views by the primary judge is not of itself a reason to refer the matter back to him: cf Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Wang [2003] HCA 11; 215 CLR 518 at [17] (Gleeson CJ), [39] (McHugh J) and [61] (Gummow and Hayne JJ).
43Perhaps because the subject matter of the proceedings in the District Court related to a criminal indictment, the applicants did not seek costs in this Court.  Accordingly no order should be made.  However, in the normal course, they would have been entitled to an award of costs of the proceedings in this Court: AB v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2014] NSWCA 122 at [31]-[32].  If any such order is sought, and it cannot be dealt with by consent, the applicants can make application to vary this judgment within 14 days, in accordance with the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW), r 36.16(3A).
44The Court should make the following orders:
(1) Set aside the judgment of the District Court delivered on 26 July 2013 dismissing an application for a certificate under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967 (NSW).  
(2) Declare that, in the circumstances of the case, the Court had power to grant a certificate pursuant to s 2 of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act.  
(3) Remit the matter to the District Court to be determined in accordance with the declaration of this Court.
45WARD JA:  I agree with Basten JA.

Dudemaine v. Coutu, [1943] S.C.R. 464

Date: 1943-06-29

Albert Dudemaine
(Plaintiff) Appellant;

and

Roland Coutu and
Carriere Lumber Company, Limited (Defendant) Respondents.

1943: May 25; 1943: June 29.

Present: Duff C.J. and Davis, Kerwin, Hudson
and Taschereau JJ.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH,
APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC

Jury trial—Practice and procedure—Option
made after expiration of delay—Consent of parties to extend delay—Right to jury
trial forfeited and cannot be revived—Rule not one of mere procedure—Conditions
prescribed for jury trial are imperative—Jurisdiction of jury extinguished
after expiration of delay—Article 442 C.C.P.

The appellant brought an action against the
respondents for damages caused to him through the death of his son, killed by
the respondent company's truck driven by the other respondent, and made option
in his statement of claim for a trial by jury. On the 12th of December, 1941,
the trial resulted in a disagreement. On the 7th of February, 1942, counsel for
the appellant prepared a motion to call a new jury and to fix the date of the
second trial, and counsel for the respondents agreed in writing to the motion.
But, on the day fixed for the trial, objection was entered by counsel for the respondents
against the hearing of the case by a jury, on the ground that the consent given
by him was not valid. The trial judge overruled the objection, and, after
verdict by a jury, awarded $3,199.60 to the appellant. The appellate court
reversed this judgment on the sole ground that the appellant had forfeited his
right to a jury trial, and the record was sent back to the Superior Court for
trial before a judge without a jury.

Held that the
appeal to this Court should be dismissed.

Per Kerwin,
Hudson and Taschereau JJ. When both parties to an action have forfeited their
right to a jury trial through the expiration of the delay prescribe by article
442 C.C.P., either of them
cannot, even with the consent of the other, revive such right, no more than
they could give a valid consent to a jury trial when the law does not grant
right to it. The obligation, imposed by that article and drawn up in imperative
terms, is more than an ordinary rule of procedure prescribing a delay, which
rule the parties would at liberty follow or extend. The right to a jury trial
is subordinate to the conditions which are intimately connected with it. The
law has not only granted a right to the litigants, but it has also conferred
jurisdiction to twelve persons to hear the case and has imposed upon them the
obligation to perform their duties, when the request has been made to the court
within the prescribed delay. Consequently, when the delay has expired, a
conditional right has been lost because the condition has not been fulfilled;
and the jurisdiction of the jury has passed away and cannot be re-established,
even with the consent of the parties.

APPEALS from the judgments of the Court of
King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the ; judgment of the
Superior Court, Savard J. and referring the case back to that Court for a new
trial.

The appellant, on the 9th of October, 1941,
brought an action against both respondents claiming damages for an amount of
$5,199.79 and making option for a trial by jury. On the 23rd of December, 1940,
the truck of the respondent company, driven by the respondent Coutu, had struck
and killed the appellant's son. A few days before the trial, the appellant
filed an incidental demand for seizure before judgment of the respondent company's
truck. A first trial before jury took place in December, 1941, but the jury
disagreed. Following the mistrial, it is contended by the appellant that
pourparlers of settlement had been in order within the thirty days' period
after the date of the first judgment; and both parties admitted that, on the
8th of January, 1942, a letter was written by the respondents' counsel offering
$500 in full settlement of the claim, which offer was refused on the 15th of
January, 1942. On the 7th of February, 1942, counsel for the appellant prepared
a motion to call a new jury and to fix the date of the trial; and counsel for
the respondents agreed in writing to the motion. But, on the day fixed, counsel
for the respondents objected to the trial and moved to strike the panel on the
ground that the consent given was not valid and that more than thirty days had
elapsed from the date of the first judgment to the date of the motion for a new
trial. The trial judge overruled the objection and ordered the parties to
proceed with the trial. The respondents were condemned, after verdict by a
jury, to pay to the appellant $3,199.79 for damages, and the incidental demand
respecting the seizure of the truck was also maintained. The appellate court,
without considering the other grounds of appeal, reversed that judgment,
holding that the appellant had lost his right to a jury trial by failing to
proceed within the delay prescribed by article 442 C.C.P.; consequently, the
verdict was quashed and the case was referred to the Superior Court to be heard
before a judge without jury. The appellant appealed to this Court.

Louis Morin K.C. for the appellant.

J. A. Gagné K.C. and W. Desjardins K.C. for
the respondents.

The judgment of the Chief Justice and Davis J.
was delivered by

The Chief
Justice.—I concur in the judgment dismissing the appeal
with costs.

The judgment of Kerwin, Hudson and Taschereau
JJ. was delivered by

Taschereau J.—Le fils du demandeur a été frappé par
l'automobile de la Carrière Lumber Company, conduite par un nommé Roland Coutu, qui à ce moment était dans
l'exercice de ses fonctions d'employé. Il est décédé quelques heures après
l'accident, et l'appelant a réclamé des dommages au montant de $5,199.79.

L'action a été instituée le 19 octobre 1941, et le 22 novembre de la
même année, par voie de demande incidente, le demandeur a fait saisir avant
jugement le camion de la défenderesse.

La cause a été entendue une première fois devant un
jury à Amos le 12 décembre 1941, mais par suite d'un désaccord un nouveau
procès s'instruisit le 10 mars 1942. Cette fois, le jury rendit un verdict
accordant au demandeur la somme de $3,199.60, et, par jugement en date du 12 mars, M. le juge Savard confirma ce verdict.

En cours du Banc du Roi, les défendeurs ont attaqué
ce jugement en invoquant les raisons suivantes:—

1. Absence de
responsabilité.

2. Faute contributoire du jeune Dudemaine.

3. Dommages excessifs.

4. Le demandeur avait perdu
son droit à un procès par jury lors du second procès, n'ayant pas fait les
procédures voulues dans les trente jours tel que l'exige l'article 442 du Code de Procédure Civile.

A l'exception de M. le juge St-Germain qui
enregistra sa dissidence après avoir examiné tous les points soulevés par les
défendeurs, la Cour du Banc du Roi ne considéra que le dernier argument, et en
vint à la conclusion que le demandeur était bien déchu de son droit au procès
par jury et que le dossier devait être retourné à la Cour Supérieure pour qu'il
en soit disposé de la manière ordinaire devant un juge. Et comme conséquence de
ce premier

[Page 467]

jugement, la Cour du Banc du Roi a maintenu aussi
le second appel des défendeurs se rapportant à la demande incidente, et a rendu
la même ordonnance.

C'est l'article 442 du Code de Procédure Civile qui doit déterminer les droits respectifs
des parties; il se lit ainsi:

442. A défaut par la
partie qui a demandé le procès par jury de procéder sur cette demande dans les
trente jours qui suivent celui où la cause est mûre pour le procès ou pour un
nouveau procès, elle est de plein droit déchue de là faculté de le faire; mais
le juge peut, sur demande faite dans l'intervalle, lui accorder un délai
additionnel pour raison valable.

L'autre partie peut, dans les quinze jours
après l'expiration de ce délai, procéder au procès par jury.

A défaut de le faire dans aucun de ces cas, la
cause peut être instruite pour enquête et audition en la manière ordinaire.

L'appelant admet évidemment que son application
pour un second procès par jury était tardive, car elle n'a été faite que le 7 février 1942, quand le premier verdict avait été rendu le 12 décembre 1941. Les délais
étaient clairement expirés, mais, l'appelant invoque un consentement signé par
les parties à ce qu'il soit procédé à la formation du rôle des jurés le 11 février 1942. Mais, il est bon de noter que, malgré le consentement donné, le
procureur des défendeurs s'est objecté à la formation du rôle, parce que les
délais étaient expirés et que le consentement était invalide. C'est cette
prétention que la Cour du Banc du Roi a maintenue, et elle en est venue à la
conclusion que le délai de trente jours est de rigueur, que les parties avaient
perdu leurs droits respectifs au procès par jury, et que le consentement ne
pouvait les faire revivre.

Il est certain, et la Cour du Banc du Roi admet ce
principe, que lorsqu'il s'agit d'une simple question de procédure, les
tribunaux doivent donner effet aux consentements donnés par les parties. Mais,
la question qui se pose ici a-t-elle le même caractère? Quand un droit
exceptionnel est donné à condition qu'il soit exercé dans un certain délai,
peut-on faire revivre par consentement ce délai expiré? Car, il est
indiscutable que dans la province de Québec, le cours normal de la procédure
est que tout procès doit s'instruire devant un juge sans jury. C'est par
exception qu'en certains cas, déterminés par le code, il y a lieu au procès par
jury. Mais, lorsque le demandeur désire exercer ce droit restreint, il doit
procéder sur cette demande dans les trente jours qui suivent celui où la cause
est mûre pour le

[Page 468]

procès, et à défaut de le faire, il est déchu
de son droit. Le défendeur peut, dans les quinze jours qui suivent, faire la
même demande, mais il est lui aussi frappé de la même déchéance s'il néglige
d'exercer ce privilège. Même le juge ne peut accorder de prolongation quand les
délais sont expirés.

Cette obligation, imposée par l'article 442 du C.P.C. et rédigée dans des termes
impératifs, me semble être plus qu'une simple règle de procédure déterminant un
délai que les parties peuvent respecter ou prolonger à volonté.

Le droit au procès par jury est subordonné à des
conditions qui y sont intimement liées, et qui pour ainsi dire en font partie.
On ne peut choisir un procès par jury sans accepter toutes les obligations qui
en découlent. Le code, en décrétant en quels cas il y aura lieu à ce mode de
procès, a non seulement accordé un droit aux plaideurs, mais il a aussi conféré
une juridiction à douze hommes d'entendre ce litige, et leur a imposé
l'obligation de servir, quand la demande est faite au tribunal dans les délais
voulus.

La Cour du Banc du Roi a décidé que les deux
parties, déchues de leur droit, ne pouvaient faire revivre ce droit expiré, pas
plus qu'elles ne pourraient donner un consentement valide à un procès par jury,
quand le code ne l'accorde pas. Un droit conditionnel a été perdu, faute de la
réalisation de la condition. La juridiction est maintenant disparue; et
celle-ci ne peut être rétablie par un consentement.

Les tribunaux de la province de Québec ont toujours
interprété sévèrement cette disposition de l'article 442
C.P.C, qui détermine dans quel délai doit agir celui qui
veut conserver son droit au procès par jury. Ainsi, en 1902,
Sir Alexandre Lacoste, parlant pour la Cour du Banc du
Roi, disait dans Canadian Pacific Railway v. Foster[1],

Le droit au procès par jury est un droit
d'exception et il faut strictement se conformer aux exigences de la loi pour
pouvoir en réclamer le bénéfice.

Le même principe a été réaffirmé en 1940 par la Cour du Banc du Roi dans Consolidated Theatres Limited v. Nihon[2]:—

[Page 469]

La demande pour le choix et l'assignation du
jury et pour la fixation des dates doit être faite dans les trente jours de la
définition des faits. La demande pour la définition des faits doit être faite
dans les trente jours qui suivent celui où la cause est mûre pour le procès.
Faute d'observer ces délais, le demandeur perd tous ses droits au procès par
jury.

Et, plus récemment encore, dans Wise v. Boxenbaum[3]:—

Le droit au procès par jury est un droit
d'exception; pour en pouvoir réclamer le bénéfice, il faut se conformer
strictement aux exigences de la loi. Il ne suffit pas d'avoir opté pour cette
forme de procès et par là d'avoir acquis le droit de s'en prévaloir; il faut
encore conserver ce droit en observant les délais prescrits. Ainsi la
définition des faits doit être demandée dans les trente jours qui
suivent celui où la cause est mûre pour le procès; et la cause est mûre pour le
procès quand la contestation est liée, ou à l'expiration du délai dans lequel
elle devait l'être. Faute d'observer ces délais, la partie perd tous ses droits
au procès par jury.

Je ne crois pas pouvoir, malgré les inconvénients
pratiques qui peuvent en résulter, entretenir une opinion différente de celle
exprimée dans le jugement dont il y a appel, et je le confirmerais.

L'appelant a cité le précédent de Lord v. La
Reine[4]. Dans cette cause, il s'agissait de savoir si
les articles 1020 et 1209 du Code de Procédure Civile de la province
de Québec, qui limitent le temps pour présenter une inscription devant la Cour
du Banc du Roi, imposent des conditions impératives sans lesquelles la cour d'appel n'a pas juridiction, et si les parties
peuvent de consentement prolonger ces délais. La Cour en est venue à la
conclusion qu'il s'agissait d'une question de procédure, où les parties
pouvaient donner un consentement valide. Je ne crois pas, cependant, que cette
décision puisse être interprétée comme voulant dire que les parties peuvent
consentir à soumettre leur litige à un jury quand ce dernier n'a plus juridiction
pour l'entendre.

Quant à l'autre précédent de cette Cour, The Montreal Tramways v. Séguin[5], je crois qu'il n'a aucune application dans
l'espèce. Dans cette cause, on s'est demandé si les parties avaient oui ou non
droit à un procès par jury; mais la demande avait été faite dans les délais
prévus au code. Personne ne s'y était objecté, et cette Cour a décidé, en
conséquence, qu'il y avait acquiescement et chose jugée sur ce point, et qu'on
ne pouvait pas invoquer ce moyen devant un tribunal d'appel. Dans le cas
actuel, lorsque le

[Page 470]

jury a été convoqué, l'intimé s'est objecté à cette
convocation vu l'expiration des délais, et on ne peut en conséquence lui
reprocher un acquiescement ou invoquer contre lui l'autorité de la chose jugée.

Pour les motifs ci-dessus, je suis d'opinion que
les deux appels de l'appelant doivent être rejetés avec dépens et vu la
conclusion à laquelle j'arrive, il est inutile de discuter les autres moyens
soulevés par l'appelant.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Bribery—Municipal
officials—Charge of attempt—Directed verdict of
acquittal—Evidence—Misdirection—Appeal against order granting new
trial—Criminal Code , 1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, ss. 104(1)(b), (e), 584.

The accused H was reeve of the Township of
York and L was a councillor. They were jointly charged under s. 104(1)  of the
Criminal Code  for offering to accept a sum of money to aid in procuring the
passing of a measure, motion or resolution concerning the issue of a building
permit. A second count of indictment contained a separate charge against L of
accepting a sum of money for the same purpose. The evidence related to certain
conversations by M, president of a company, and P, a building contractor, with
the accused. The trial judge directed the jury to acquit on the ground that all
preparations had been made for the issue of the permit before the alleged
conversations had taken place, or before any money had been paid over to L. The
Court of Appeal ordered a new trial. The accused appealed to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

It is true that the permit was issued before
the passing of the bylaw but on the evidence it was issued after the
conversations had taken place and it was followed by the passing of the bylaw.
Although there was

[Page 466]

no express mention in the evidence of the
payment of money for the purpose of procuring a vote for the adoption of the
bylaw, the jury was entitled to look at the evidence as a whole—the preliminary
conversations, the issue of the permit and the subsequent passing of the bylaw
with the two accused voting for it. It was an error to isolate the vote from
the issue of the permit and there was, in these circumstances, evidence to go
to the jury on both counts.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario, setting aside the verdict of acquittal and directing a new trial.
Appeal dismissed.

Joseph Sedgwick, Q.C., for the appellant
Linden.

E. Arthur Martin, Q.C., for the appellant
Hall.

W.C. Bowman, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

JUDSON J.:—In the year 1956 the two appellants
were municipal officials of the Township of York, Frederick W. Hall being the
reeve and Harold D. Linden one of the councillors. They were jointly indicted
under s. 104(1)  of the Criminal Code  for offering to accept a sum of
money from one Neil J. May to aid in procuring the adoption of a measure,
motion or resolution concerning the issue of a building permit to him. The
second count of the indictment contains a separate charge against Harold D.
Linden of accepting from one Harry D. Payne a sum of money for the same
purpose. At the conclusion of the case for the Crown, on the motion of counsel
for the defence, the learned trial judge directed the jury to return a verdict
of not guilty on both counts. The Court of Appeal held that there was error in
so directing the jury, being unanimously of the opinion that there was some
evidence fit for submission to the jury on both counts. The two accused now
appeal to this Court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal setting aside the
verdict of acquittal and directing a new trial.

The evidence on which the Court of Appeal acted
is set out in full in its reasons. I do not propose to repeat more than the
following brief summary.

Early in 1956 Neil J. May, the president and
sole shareholder of Carbide Tool Company Limited, decided to extend his factory
building in the Township of York. He first discussed a building permit with the
Township Engineer and, on March 6, 1956, he completed the filing of the
necessary

[Page 467]

documents for the issue of the permit. On March
8, he entered into a building contract with Harry D. Payne for the construction
of the building.

On March 12, at a meeting of the Committee of
General Purposes of the township, May’s application for the permit was approved
subject to a ten-foot set-back of the north wall of the proposed building from
the neighbouring lands. On March 19, the next meeting of the Committee of
General Purposes took place. In the meantime May secured the consent of the
owners of the neighbouring lands to the erection of the building as shown on
the original plans. At this meeting of the Committee the application was
approved unanimously.

The general building by-law of the township provides as follows:

S. 4 A permit shall be obtained from the
Building Inspector by the owner or the legally authorized agent of the owner,
for the erection, alterations, reconstruction, removal or wrecking of, or
repairs to any (or part of any) building or structure.

S. 84 (aa) Notwithstanding anything in this
By-law contained, the Building Inspector shall not grant a permit for nor shall
any person erect, construct or alter, a building or structure within the
Township of York to be used for the purpose of a factory,…unless and until the
plans and specifications have been first submitted to and been approved by
Council after a report thereon has been submitted to Council by the Building
Inspector and by the Chief of the Fire Department.

Evidence was given by the township solicitor
that the usual practice was to issue a building permit without waiting for the
passing of the by-law approving the minutes of the meeting of the Committee for
General Purposes, and that the passing of the by-law authorizing the permit was
regarded as a mere formality. The township engineer gave evidence to the same
effect.

On March 20, 1956, May applied to the township
office for his building permit and was told that it was not ready. On March 21,
May had a meeting with Hall in the latter’s office, having made the appointment
by telephone the day before. May says that at this meeting Hall solicited a
bribe and sent him on to see Linden, who also made the same suggestion. May
also says that Linden called Hall in his presence and discussed the issue of
the permit and stated that May understood what the position was. Following this
conversation, May spoke to his lawyer before he returned to

[Page 468]

speak to Hall. On the second interview with Hall
the township engineer was called in. He said that everything in connection with
the permit was in order. After the engineer had left Hall referred to the
arrangement which May had made with Linden and suggested that the money could
be left in the glove compartment of his car. He pointed out where the car was
parked. May also says that Hall, after a telephone conversation with the
building department, told him that the permit was ready and to go down to the
building department. May says that he did go down to the building department
but the permit was not ready and that he was told to pick it up the following
day. He did attend on the following day at the building inspector’s department
and the permit was delivered to him. May says that he did not give any money
either to Linden or to Hall. He had already spoken to a solicitor and
afterwards he and his solicitor interviewed the Assistant Crown Attorney.

Payne says that he did give the sum of $100 to
Linden for the issue of a permit.

Up to this time, of course, the authorizing
by-law had not been passed. There was nothing except the minute of the General
Purposes Committee and what was referred to as the general practice to support
the issue of the permit.

The grounds on which the learned trial judge directed
the jury to acquit both accused were as follows:

The evidence clearly indicates that
everything had been done as far as finalizing the preparation for the issuing
of the building permit or the authorizing of the issuing of the building
permit, before these alleged conversations took place with the two accused men,
or before any money was paid over to Linden, as is alleged.

So it could not have been paid or could not
have been promised for the purpose alleged against them, because the thing had
already been done, it could not have been agreed to be paid or paid for the
purpose of procuring the passage of a measure authorizing it.

The case for the prosecution is that it is open
to the jury to infer from the evidence that the two appellants made an offer to
accept money for assistance in obtaining a valid building permit and that this
necessarily involved the passing of a by-law upon which each was entitled to
vote and subsequently did in fact vote. I have outlined above the chronology of
the evidence until the building by-law was passed. May, as an applicant, was in
no position to demand of the building inspector that he issue a permit. It is
true that the permit was issued before the passing of the

[Page 469]

by-law but on this evidence it was issued after
the conversations between May and Hall and Linden and between Payne and Linden
had taken place and it was followed by the passing of the by-law. Although
there is no express mention in the evidence of the payment of money for the
purpose of procuring a vote for the adoption of the by-law, the jury is
entitled to look at the evidence as a whole—the preliminary conversations, the
issue of the permit and the subsequent passing of the by-law with the two
accused voting for it. It was error to isolate the vote from the issue of the
permit and there is, in these circumstances, evidence to go to the jury on both
counts.

I would dismiss the appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
MANITOBA

Criminal law—Narcotics—Trafficking—Drug sold
to undercover agent—Accused taking money—Delivery by another person—Criminal
Code , 21—Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N-1, s. 4(1).

Criminal law—Appeal—Question of law alone.

A, an undercover agent, told L that he would
love to have some hashish. L introduced A to the accused who said that he was
on his way to get some and that the price was $8 a gram. A gave the accused the
money for two grams and L said that he would go with the accused and return
with the drug. Some twenty minutes later L met A in the washroom of a beverage
room and delivered the hashish. The accused was charged with trafficking
contrary to s. 4 (1) of the Narcotic Control Act. The trial judge
acquitted the accused on the ground that the evidence was as consistent with
the fact that the accused was acting for A alone as it was consistent with the
fact he was delivering or selling or trading in drugs or offering to do so. By
a majority judgment, the Court of Appeal set aside the verdict of acquittal and
registered a conviction. The accused appealed to this Court.

Held (Laskin
J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Judson, Ritchie and Dickson JJ.: The civil law of “agency” cannot be applied in
this context. “Agency” does not serve to make non-criminal an act which would
otherwise be attended by criminal consequences. Even if the appellant could be
said to be the agent of A for the purposes of civil responsibility, his acts
may, none the less, amount to trafficking in narcotics or aiding in such
trafficking. If the evidence was consistent with the accused delivering or
selling or trading in drugs or offering to do so, the fact that he may have
been acting as an agent for A would not exculpate him. An alternative view is
that the appellant aided and abetted an un-identified

[Page 650]

vendor in selling, and L in delivering the
narcotic to A.

Per Laskin J.,
dissenting: One who buys a narcotic does not by that act engage in
trafficking, and, similarly, one who assists in a purchase is not guilty of
trafficking through the effect of s. 21 of the Code. The evidence supports
no other purpose than that of aiding in a purchase. It was L and the unknown
seller who were the traffickers.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
of Manitoba[1],
setting aside the acquittal of the appellant and registering a conviction.
Appeal dismissed, Laskin J. dissenting.

G. Brodsky, for the appellant.

S.F. Sommerfeld, Q.C., and J.E. Hodges,
for the respondent.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie and
Dickson JJ. was delivered by

DICKSON J.—In May 1970 an undercover agent with
the R.C.M.P. Drug Squad, Constable Arsenault, assumed the role of singer with a
rock band known as the Prodigal Son. The band played in the beverage room of
the Westminster Hotel in Winnipeg. One afternoon in the beverage room Arsenault
said to one Little, “I would really love to get my hands on some good hash. I
feel like really getting stoned”. Shortly after, Little, followed by Arsenault,
left the hotel in search of the accused, known as the Beast, whom they located
on the street not far from the hotel. Arsenault was introduced to the accused
and the following dialogue ensued:

Little (to the accused): We were wondering
if you had any hash?

The accused: No, I was just on my way to
the Diggers (the name of a house in the vicinity) to get some.

The accused (to Arsenault): How much do you
want?

Arsenault: Two grams will be plenty.

[Page 651]

The accused: They are going for $8.00 a
gram.

Arsenault: Do you have change for twenty?

Arsenault’s twenty dollar bill was changed at a
drug store located in the Westminster Hotel and $16.00 handed by him to the
accused. Arsenault had to return to the beverage room to sing and asked the
accused when he might expect the accused to arrive with the hashish. Little
interrupted and said he was going to accompany the accused to the Diggers and
would be returning with the hashish. Arsenault went back to the beverage room.
Some twenty minutes later Little met Arsenault in the wash room area of the
beverage room, and delivered the hashish.

The accused was charged with unlawfully
trafficking in hashish (Cannabis Resin) contrary to the provisions of the Narcotic
Control Act and amendments thereto. Hashish is a narcotic. The definition
of “trafficking” is found in s. 2 of the Act:

(a) to manufacture, sell, give,
administer, transport, send, deliver or distribute, or

(b) to offer to do anything
mentioned in paragraph (a);

otherwise than under the authority of the
Act or the regulations.

Section 21(1)  of the Criminal Code  provides
that anyone who does or omits to do anything for the purpose of aiding any
person to commit an offence or abets any person in committing it is a party to
the offence. It follows that anyone who sells or delivers hashish or offers to
do so, or does anything for the purpose of aiding another person to do so, is
guilty of an offence.

At the conclusion of the trial of the accused in
County Court Judges’ Criminal Court, Thompson C.C.J. said:

I find that the facts in evidence which
have been placed before the Court have not established trafficking as defined
in the Narcotics Control Act, beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence indicates
it is as consistent with the fact that this accused was acting for Arsenault
alone as it is consistent with the fact he was delivering or selling or trading
in drugs or offering to do so.

[Page 652]

It seems to me that there is not a clear
case here of proof of trafficking, and I am finding the accused not guilty.

It seems manifest that Thompson C.C.J. relied on
what was said by Jessup J.A. in Regina v. Madigan[2]:

It is not an offence under the statute to
purchase controlled drugs. Accordingly, no criminal liability would attach to
the acts of the accused if he had been the purchaser. It follows that similarly
no criminal liability attaches to such acts if they were on behalf of the
purchaser as his agent. In my opinion, on the peculiar facts of this case, it
cannot be said they are consistent only with the accused acting as an agent
either for the vendor or for both the vendor and the purchaser; they are
equally consistent with him acting as an agent for the purchaser alone.

An appeal from the judgment of Thompson C.C.J.
was taken to the Court of Appeal of Manitoba[3]
and that Court by a majority, Freedman C.J.M. dissenting, allowed the appeal,
set aside the verdict of acquittal and registered a conviction against the
accused. Freedman C.J.M. held that the judgment did not involve a question of
law alone and, therefore, the appeal failed for lack of jurisdiction.

As I read the judgment of Thompson C.C.J., he
found the evidence placed before him to be consistent with the fact that the
accused was acting as an agent for Arsenault in the purchase, and consistent
with the fact that the accused was delivering or selling drugs or offering to
do so. Then, seemingly applying the rule in Hodge’s case, and finding
the evidence equally consistent with two alternative theories, the one pointing
to innocence and the other to guilt, he acquitted the appellant. The fallacy,
if I may say so, in this reasoning lies in the fact that even if the appellant
can be considered to have been “acting for” Constable Arsenault, it does not

[Page 653]

follow that he could not also have done one or
more of the acts which constitute “trafficking” under the Narcotic Control
Act. It was argued on behalf of the appellant that the words “to buy” do
not appear in the definition of “trafficking” under the Narcotic Control
Act; therefore a mere purchaser does not traffic and an agent for the
purchaser comes under the same protective umbrella. I do not agree. One cannot
apply the civil law of “agency” in this context. “Agency” does not serve to
make non-criminal an act which would otherwise be attended by criminal
consequences. Even if the appellant could be said to be the “agent” of
Constable Arsenault for the purposes of civil responsibility, his acts may,
none the less, amount to trafficking in narcotics or aiding in such
trafficking. If, as the trial judge would seem to have found, the evidence was
consistent with the accused delivering or selling or trading in drugs or
offering to do so, the fact that he may have been acting as an agent for
Arsenault would not exculpate him.

I am further of the opinion that the question
before the Court of Appeal of Manitoba, and before this Court is a question of
law, and law alone. It can be identified readily in the judgment of Thompson
C.C.J., namely, does the fact that an accused is acting as an agent for a
purchaser of narcotics afford a good defence. This question can be asked, and
answered, without reference to the detail of the particular case.

In The Queen v. Lemire[4], Martland J., for the majority of the
Court, said:

In my opinion, the guilt of the respondent
in the present appeal depends upon the legal effect of facts found, or
inferred, in the Court below. This raises questions of law in respect of which,
for the reasons already stated, I think there was error. There is no ground not
involving such questions upon which Lemire’s appeal could have been allowed.
There was,

[Page 654]

therefore, a right of appeal to this Court
and the appeal should succeed.

I would only add this. On the evidence, it was
undoubtedly open to the judge to find that there were present the three
essential elements of any sale: the agreement or bargain, the payment of the
price and, through the aid of Little, the delivery or conveyance of the
property. An alternative view is that the accused aided and abetted an
unidentified vendor in selling, and Little in delivering the narcotic to
Constable Arsenault. Whichever view one takes, the appellant did unlawfully
traffic in a narcotic contrary to the provisions of the Narcotic Control
Act.

I would dismiss the appeal.

LASKIN J. (dissenting)—I have had the
advantage of reading the reasons of Dickson J. before preparing my own. He has
accurately recited the facts upon which the accused was acquitted at trial but
convicted on appeal, Freedman C.J.M. dissenting, on a charge of unlawful
trafficking in hashish contrary to s. 4(1) of the Narcotic Control Act,
R.S.C. 1970, c.N‑1. In my opinion, the trial judge came to the
correct result which I support for different reasons.

Trafficking under s. 4(1) and possession
for the purpose of trafficking under s. 4(2) are serious offences, life
imprisonment being the ultimate penalty in each case. By contrast, mere
possession of a narcotic, an offence under s. 3, is punishable on summary
conviction (by fine or imprisonment or both, the term of imprisonment being six
months for a first offence and one year for a subsequent offence) or on
indictment by imprisonment up to seven years. Trafficking is defined in
s. 2 of the Act as follows:

(a) to manufacture, sell, give,
administer, transport, send, deliver or distribute, or

[Page 655]

(b) to offer to do anything
mentioned in paragraph (a);

otherwise than under the authority of the
Act or the regulations.

It is to be noted that one who buys a narcotic
does not by that act engage in trafficking, and, similarly, one who assists in
a purchase is not guilty of trafficking through the effect of s. 21  of the
Criminal Code . Section 21  makes a person a party to an offence if he
does or omits to do anything for the purpose of aiding any person to commit it.
In a broad sense, every purchaser by reason of the purchase may be said to be
aiding in a sale of a narcotic, and if this is enough to make him guilty of
trafficking then on this reasoning every person who aids a purchaser would
likewise be guilty unless excused by the Regulations. This broad sense of the
matter fails to take account of the words in s. 21  “for the purpose of
aiding”. Moreover, since possession of a narcotic is an offence, and there is
an onus on an accused who pleads not guilty to a charge under s. 4(2)  to
establish that his possession was not for the purpose of trafficking (see
s. 8 of the Act), it would, in my opinion, be incongruous to turn a mere
purchaser into a trafficker by using s. 21  of the Criminal Code  to
supply the want of definition. I did not understand that there was any dispute
with this view in the present case.

The question becomes therefore whether what the
accused did should be viewed as done for the purpose of aiding an unknown
seller to make a sale. There is no evidence that the accused himself sold the
hashish or that he transported it, sent it or delivered it or distributed it.
The evidence shows that the accused went away with Little, that it was Little
who said he would be returning with the hashish and that it was Little who
delivered it to Arsenault. There is no evidence that the accused returned to
the place of delivery with Little, and it is clear he was not with Little when
the latter made the delivery. All there is to connect the accused with the
hashish is the fact that Arsenault gave

[Page 656]

him $16 which the accused said was the price of
two grams and that he went off with Little.

If, on the facts of this case, one had to decide
if the accused was party to a contract for the sale and purchase of hashish it
would be an extravagant conclusion so to find. It would, however, be open to
find, as a matter of the civil law, that he had agreed to obtain or assist in
obtaining hashish for Arsenault. Such a finding would be equally open as a
matter of the criminal law if it was an offence to purchase a narcotic substance.
Since it is not, this Court is being asked to conclude that the accused was
acting for the purpose of aiding an undisclosed seller to supply hashish for
Arsenault. Having regard to the burden of proof on the Crown, it would, in my
opinion, be conjecture to come to that conclusion just as it would be
conjecture to conclude that the accused was himself the seller.

I agree with my brother Dickson that doctrines
of agency are apt to mislead if one should seek to apply them in the criminal
law in their full civil law significance. As he says, the accused could be
agent for Arsenault and still be guilty of trafficking if he delivered the
hashish to his principal. That does not mean, however, that an agent for a
purchaser who does not engage in any of the acts enumerated in s. 2 may
none the less be guilty of trafficking. We come full circle here if, apart from
involvement in any such acts, s. 21  of the Criminal Code  is invoked
to implicate such an agent.

What is left then to implicate the accused is
that he may have directed Little to a seller, having received $16 from
Arsenault. There is no evidence to show that the accused kept the money or
whether he did not give it to Little or who paid it to the seller or even if it
was so paid. Little gave no evidence, although he was associated with Arsenault
and was the person who had agreed to bring the hashish to Arsenault. In my
opinion, the accused was not,

[Page 657]

in what he did, acting for the purpose of aiding
in the sale or delivery or distribution of a narcotic unless it can be said, as
a matter of law, that by taking Little to a source of supply, if that is what
happened, he did so for the purpose of aiding in the sale or delivery of the
hashish to Arsenault.

In my opinion, the evidence supports no other
purpose than that of aiding in a purchase. It was Little and the unknown seller
who were the traffickers. The incidental effect of what the accused did was to
aid indirectly in a sale or transportation or delivery of a narcotic drug, but,
again, thus cannot be brought within s. 21  of the Criminal Code  when
the definition of “trafficking” in s. 2  excludes purchase.

I would accordingly allow the appeal, set aside
the conviction and restore the acquittal of the accused. I would add that I
also agree with Freedman C.J.M. that the appeal to the Manitoba Court of Appeal
from the decision of the trial judge was not upon a question of law alone.
Whether the Crown has proved guilt beyond a reasonable doubt does not raise a
question of law alone; and, in finding as he did that the burden of proof had
not been met, the trial judge weighed the evidence and found it wanting. What
he said on the aspect of consistency of the evidence with guilt or no guilt
does not afford any basis upon which to charge him with having erred in law
alone; it was again simply an assessment of the evidence.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT FOR APPEAL FOR ALBERTA

Criminal
law—Murder—Defences—Justification—Whether or not “qualified” defence of use of
excessive force in preventing commission of indictable offence a recognized
defence—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 27, 34.

Criminal law—Charge to jury—Whether or not
errors made in charge warranting retrial.

Respondent was charged with second degree
murder. The defence maintained that the victim had assaulted one of
respondent’s associates and that respondent and his co-accused killed the
victim while trying to prevent that offence. The question arose in respect of
s. 27  of the Criminal Code  as to whether there exists in Canada a “qualified” defence of use of
excessive force in preventing the commission of an offence which would have the
effect of reducing what would otherwise be murder to manslaughter.

Held (Martland,
Ritchie and Estey JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Dickson,
Beetz, Chouinard and Lamer JJ.: In Canada there is no “qualified” defence of
use of excessive force in the prevention of the commission of an offence which
would have the effect of reducing what would otherwise be murder to
manslaughter. The effect of s. 27  is to justify the accused in committing
what would otherwise be an unlawful act. If in the opinion of the jury the
force used in preventing the commission of an offence was reasonable in all the
circumstances, the accused is entitled to an acquittal. If the s. 27 
defence fails, the jury should render the verdict which would have been
rendered, absent s. 27 . That will be murder if the accused had the
required intent. The proper verdict may be manslaughter not because of a
partial justification under s. 27  but because the special mental element
required for guilt of murder has not been proven. The

[Page 287]

half-way house is not to be found in
s. 27  but, if at all, in s. 212.

The trial judge’s charge to the jury was in
error. Firstly, the judge erred by charging the jury on self-defence under
s. 34 when there was no evidence from which a jury could reasonably infer
that the accused assisted in killing the victim under a reasonable apprehension
of death or grievous bodily harm. The judge charged the jury that if the
accused used more force than was reasonably necessary for self-defence, they
must find the accused not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. In
devoting so much attention to self-defence the judge failed to direct attention
to the only possible ground of justification, namely s. 27  and the use of
force to prevent the commission of an offence.

Secondly, the charge on s. 27  was
inadequate. The judge failed to make clear that if justification under
s. 27  did not succeed, the verdict would be murder or manslaughter
depending upon the presence or absence of intent. There was evidence which put
the question of intent and the possibility of a manslaughter verdict in issue.

The jury were confused as to the distinction
between murder and manslaughter, twice asking for redirection. Only in the
second redirection did the judge state that “the difference between murder and
manslaughter is one of intent”. It is not clear that at this point in the
deliberations this statement was sufficient to overcome the confusion caused by
the other deficiencies in the charge.

Per Laskin
C.J. and McIntyre J.: The potential for confusion in the charge to the jury
warranted an order for a new trial. The trial judge erred in charging the jury
on s. 34 of the Code for the facts did not support the defence of self-defence.
The charge did not adequately deal with the s. 27  defence and did not
leave it clearly open to the jury that the verdict of manslaughter could be
returned in the absence of an intent to kill, despite the use of excessive
force.

Per Martland, Ritchie
and Estey JJ., dissenting: There is no “qualified” defence of the use of
excessive force in the prevention of an offence having the effect of reducing
what would otherwise be murder to man-

[Page 288]

slaughter. The charge to the jury contained
no errors sufficient to warrant the granting of a new trial. The respondent
could not properly complain of placing the issue of self-defence before the
jury for it was not prejudicial to him. The trial judge properly dealt with the
application of s. 27  for the factual background of the case did not
require the jury to be charged with respect to s. 21(b). The charge
adequately explained the difference between murder and manslaughter.

[R. v. McKay, [1957] V.R. 560; Brisson

APPEAL from a judgment of the Alberta Court
of Appeal (1980), 55 C.C.C. (2d) 525, 19 C.R. (3d) 222, 26 A.R. 212, allowing
respondent’s appeal from his conviction for murder and ordering a new trial.
Appeal dismissed, Martland, Ritchie and Estey JJ. dissenting.

B.R. Fraser, for the appellant.

Noel O’Brien, for the respondent.

The reasons of Laskin C.J. and McIntyre J. were
delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—This is a Crown appeal by
leave against a unanimous judgment of the Alberta Court of Appeal, setting
aside but for different reasons in that Court, a conviction of murder. The
grounds of appeal advanced by the Crown are set out in the reasons herein
delivered by Dickson J. and I need not repeat them but to say only that they
relate to errors of the trial judge in directing the jury that excessive force
in preventing the commission of a crime against another will reduce a charge of
murder against an accused to manslaughter and that honest but mistaken belief
that no more force is being used than is necessary will likewise reduce murder
to manslaughter. Although there were other issues raised by the Crown
respecting self-defence, I am in agreement with Dickson J. that there was no
basis for self-defence and hence error of the trial judge in charging the jury
on Criminal Code , s. 34  which applies only where self-defence is an
issue.

[Page 289]

The members of the Alberta Court of Appeal,
McDermid, Moir and Prowse JJ.A., based themselves wholly on the issues noted
above respecting the reduction of murder to manslaughter and on justification
as it arises under Criminal Code , s. 27 . Error of the trial judge in
some of those respects was held to be sufficient to support an order for a new
trial. In view of the positions taken by the respondent in the appeal here, I
find it unnecessary to explore the different views upon which the members of
the Court of Appeal proceeded.

It is a well-established principle of our
criminal law that a respondent to an appeal here is entitled to hold a judgment
in his favour on any grounds available to that respondent which were raised
below and are accepted by this Court, notwithstanding that those grounds were
not supported below and the appellant has based the appeal here on completely
different grounds.

In the appeal to this Court, the respondent
relied on the trial judge’s failure to direct the jury properly on
justification, an issue which apparently influenced the order of the Alberta
Court of Appeal for a new trial.

More telling, however, for the accused
respondent was the error of the trial judge in charging on self-defence, which
was a non-issue, and in failing to deal adequately with the defence under
s. 27 of the Code, which was the only defence open to the accused.
She did not leave it clearly open to the jury that a manslaughter verdict could
be returned, even where excessive force had been used, if the jury doubted the
existence of an intent to kill. This omission, coupled with the misplaced
emphasis on self-defence under s. 34 of the Code, created
confusion, and I agree with Mr. Justice Dickson that, cumulatively, as a
result of the errors, there was such a potential for confusion as to warrant
the order for a new trial. In the result, I would dismiss the appeal.

[Page 290]

The reasons of Martland, Ritchie and Estey JJ.
were delivered by

MARTLAND J. (dissenting)—I am in
agreement with the opinion expressed by Mr. Justice Dickson that, in
relation to s. 27  of the Criminal Code , there does not exist a
“qualified” defence of the use of excessive force in the prevention of the commission
of an offence which would have the effect of reducing what would otherwise be
murder to manslaughter. I do not agree that, accepting that view of the law,
there were errors in the charge to the jury sufficient to warrant the granting
of a new trial.

It is said that there was error on the part of
the trial judge in charging the jury with respect to self-defence under
s. 34 of the Code. I agree that there was no evidence from which
the jury could reasonably infer that the respondent, when he assisted in
killing Powley, did so under a reasonable apprehension of death or grievous
bodily harm, or that he reasonably believed he could not otherwise save himself
from bodily injury. However, the issue of self-defence was raised when it was
suggested that the respondent acted after Powley had lunged at him with a
broken bottle. The trial judge felt that the respondent was entitled to have
that defence put before the jury.

The charge in relation to s. 34  was not
prejudicial to the respondent and it was favourable to him in that the jury was
directed that if more force was used than was reasonably necessary for the
respondent to defend himself, the jury should find the accused not guilty of
murder, but guilty of manslaughter. In my opinion the placing before the jury
of the issue of self-defence was not something about which the respondent can
properly complain and it was not an error which should result in a new trial.

The only defence upon which the respondent
sought to rely which has real substance is that which is provided in s. 27
of the Code:

27. Every
one is justified in using as much force as is reasonably necessary

(a) to prevent the commission
of an offence

[Page 291]

(i) for which, if it were committed, the
person who committed it might be arrested without warrant, and

(ii) that would be likely to cause
immediate and serious injury to the person or property of anyone; or

(b) to prevent anything being
done that, on reasonable and probable grounds he believes would, if it were
done be an offence mentioned in paragraph (a).

In my opinion this defence was properly placed
before the jury in the charge. The trial judge said:

The second defence of justification raised
by the accused is that of preventing the commission of an offence. The Criminal
Code  provides that “Everyone is justified in using as much force as is
reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence for which, if it
were committed, the person who committed it might be arrested without warrant
and that would be likely to cause immediate and serious injury to the person or
property of anyone”. The offence of assault causing bodily harm is one for
which a person may be arrested without a warrant, so that you need not concern
yourselves with this aspect of the defence. You must consider whether the
accused acted to prevent the commission of an offence, the offence of assault
causing bodily harm, and whether this offence was likely to cause immediate and
serious injury to the person of Paul Racz. If you are satisfied that they did
not, then, you should reject this defence. If you are satisfied or if you have
a reasonable doubt that the accused acted in this manner, then, you must
consider whether they used no more force than was reasonably necessary under
the circumstances.

The evidence in the statements of the
accused and in the testimony of the accused Gee indicates that when the fight
broke out initially they ran. When they returned to the bedroom, they found
Racz and Powley in the struggle that you have heard described and both were
covered with blood. They have indicated repeatedly,—I don’t think I need to
review the evidence in this regard. It runs throughout the statements and
through the evidence of Gee and you will have the statements with you so that
you can examine them. The theme runs throughout the statements and in the
evidence of the accused Gee that they were afraid that Powley was

[Page 292]

going to cause serious harm to Racz or to
kill him. Again, you should consider that they had some knowledge of Powley’s
background with respect to sadism. You should consider the circumstances in
which they found themselves and their mental condition. Under all of these
circumstances, you must consider whether they acted to prevent Powley from
causing bodily harm by assaulting Racz. You must then consider whether the
force that they used was reasonably necessary.

If you are satisfied that this defence has
been established or if you have a reasonable doubt with respect to it, you must
find the accused not guilty of murder.

The factual background of this case did not
require the trial judge to charge the jury in respect of para. (b)
of s. 27 . The evidence submitted on behalf of the defence was that the
respondent, and his co-accused Susan Fife, inflicted repeated blows on the
deceased, Powley, in order to assist and protect their friend, Racz, with whom
Powley was fighting. Their efforts, according to this evidence, were directed
toward preventing the continuation of an assault by Powley, who was armed with
a broken bottle.

This evidence relates to the prevention of a
crime under para. (a). It relates to the prevention of a
continuing assault on Powley. It does not relate to the prevention of an
assault, which is the situation contemplated by para. (b).

In her recharge to the jury, the trial judge said:

Ladies and gentlemen, I have received a
question from you indicating that you wish described in clear and defined in
clear and concise terms culpable homicide, second degree murder and
manslaughter.

With respect to culpable homicide, a person
commits culpable homicide when he causes the death of a human being by means of
an unlawful act. With respect to murder, culpable homicide is murder—and I
think I advised you previously that you can disregard the phrase second degree,
it is not of significance with respect to your deliberations. Culpable homicide
is murder where the person who causes the death of a human being means to cause
his death or means to cause him bodily harm that he knows is likely to cause
his death and is reckless whether death ensues or not. With respect to
manslaughter, culpable homicide that is not murder is

[Page 293]

manslaughter. Perhaps, I can assist you
further. There are four circumstances under which you must find the accused not
guilty of murder period. If you have even a reasonable doubt that the accused
committed culpable homicide, you must find them not guilty of murder. If you
have even a reasonable doubt with respect to the defence of self-defence, you
must find them not guilty of murder. If you have even a reasonable doubt with
respect to the defence of acting to prevent the commission of an offence, you
should find them not guilty of murder. If you have even a reasonable doubt with
respect to the defence of necessity, you must find them not guilty of murder.

There are three circumstances under which
you must find the accused not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. If
you have a reasonable doubt with respect to the defence of self-defence, but
are satisfied that more force was used than was necessary, you must find the
accused not guilty of murder and guilty of manslaughter. If you have even a
reasonable doubt with respect to the defence of provocation, you must find the
accused not guilty of murder and guilty of manslaughter. If you are satisfied
that the accused committed culpable homicide, but have a reasonable doubt with
respect to whether they committed murder, then you must find the accused not
guilty of murder and guilty of manslaughter.

It is put against the trial judge that, in the
second paragraph of this passage she did not refer to s. 27 . The reason
for this is that, in the first paragraph of the passage, the trial judge lists
four circumstances in which, as she puts it, “you must find the accused not
guilty of murder period”. One of these circumstances was the s. 27  defence
“If you have even a reasonable doubt with respect to the defence of acting to
prevent the commission of an offence, you should find them not guilty of
murder”.

The second paragraph deals with those situations
in which the jury may find the accused not guilty of murder, but guilty of
manslaughter. The defence under s. 27  does not appear here because the
trial judge was of the view, which I share, that

[Page 294]

there is no qualified defence of the use of
excessive force to prevent the commission of a crime which would have the
effect of reducing what would otherwise be murder to manslaughter.

The trial judge had already dealt, and in my
opinion properly, with the necessity for proof of intent in order to establish
a charge of murder. In the first paragraph of the passage above quoted she
said: “Culpable homicide is murder where the person who causes the death of a
human being means to cause his death or means to cause him bodily harm that he
knows is likely to cause death and is reckless whether death ensues or not.
With respect to manslaughter, culpable homicide that is not murder is
manslaughter”.

In a further recharge she said:

Murder can be committed in two ways. First,
a person commits murder when he causes the death of a human being by means of
an unlawful act and means to cause his death. Secondly, a person commits murder
when he causes the death of a human being by means of an unlawful act and means
to cause him bodily harm that he knows is likely to cause his death and is
reckless whether death ensues or not. I will repeat that. A person commits
murder when he causes the death of a human being by means of an unlawful act
and means to cause him bodily harm that he knows is likely to cause his death
and is reckless whether death ensues or not. A person commits manslaughter when
he causes the death of a human being by means of an unlawful act. The
difference between murder and manslaughter is one of intent. I can repeat for
you what I said with respect to manslaughter. A person commits manslaughter
when he causes the death of a human being by means of an unlawful act.

In my opinion the trial judge in her charge
dealt properly with the application of s. 27  and with the difference
between murder and manslaughter. Section 27  provides, where applicable, an
absolute defence. If unreasonable force is used to prevent the commission of a
crime, s. 27  is inapplicable

[Page 295]

and, in such a case, the section does not
operate to reduce the crime of murder to manslaughter. On the facts of the
present case the only way in which a verdict of manslaughter could have been
rendered would have been on the basis of lack of intent to commit murder or on
the basis of provocation. Both of those possibilities were, in my opinion,
properly submitted to the jury.

In the result, it is my opinion that there were
no errors in the charge to the jury which were prejudicial to the accused. The
appeal should be allowed, the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be set
aside and the verdict at trial should be restored.

The judgment of Dickson, Beetz, Chouinard and
Lamer JJ. was delivered by

DICKSON J.—The question in this case is whether
there exists in Canada a “qualified” defence of use of excessive force in
preventing the commission of an offence which would have the effect of reducing
what would otherwise be murder to manslaughter. The question arises in respect
of s. 27  of the Criminal Code  which reads:

27. Every
one is justified in using as much force as is reasonably necessary

(a) to prevent the commission of an
offence

(i) for which, if it were committed, the
person who committed it might be arrested without warrant, and

(ii) that would be likely to cause
immediate and serious injury to the person or property of anyone; or

(b) to prevent anything being
done that, on reasonable and probable grounds he believes would, if it were
done, be an offence mentioned in paragraph (a).

I

The Facts

The respondent Gee and one Susan Fife were
charged that they did unlawfully kill David Powley and thereby commit second
degree murder contrary to the Criminal Code . They were tried before a
jury, convicted as charged and sentenced to life

[Page 296]

imprisonment without eligibility for parole for
ten years.

On the evening of November 15, 1978, Gee, a male
prostitute and female impersonator, Fife, a prostitute, and one Paul Racz met
at Gee’s house for drinks before going into the street for the purposes of
prostitution. As the weather was inclement the respondent made arrangements for
the three of them to go to the home of the deceased, David Powley, who was
known to the respondent and described by him as a “kinky trick who had lots of
money”. When they arrived they had some more drinks at the bar and then
proceeded to an upstairs bedroom. What happened thereafter is described in a
statement given by the respondent to the police, a short resumé of which is as
follows. Powley suggested that Racz dress up in women’s lingerie which Racz
hesitatingly agreed to do. Gee and Fife looked for other lingerie. The
statement continues: “The next thing I knew, I heard a smash and we turned
around and David and Paul were wrestling. I think Paul tried to knock him out
by hitting him over the head with a bottle”. Gee and Fife struck Powley over
the head numerous times with objects, including bottles, a frying pan and a
lamp. When they ceased Powley was dead. The theory of the Crown was that the
killing was the result of a planned robbery which Powley had resisted. The
theory of the defence was that Powley attacked Racz and was committing an
assault upon him; the respondent and Fife were attempting to prevent the
commission of that offence and killed Powley in the process.

II

The Alberta Court of Appeal

All three judges of the Alberta Court of Appeal,
for reasons which were by no means concordant, allowed the respondent’s appeal
and directed a new trial. McDermid J.A. accepted the law in Canada to be as in
Australia and that the honest although mistaken belief that no more force is
being used than is necessary is a defence that reduces what would otherwise be murder
to manslaughter and that such defence is applicable by virtue of s. 7(3) 
of the Criminal Code  to the

[Page 297]

defence of self-defence. Mr. Justice
McDermid held that this reduction from murder to manslaughter is applicable
also where the defence is that the force used is to prevent the commission of a
crime. He found the justification for this reduction of murder to manslaughter
in the lesser degree of “moral culpability” of a person who uses more force
than is necessary but not more force than he honestly but mistakenly believes
is necessary, to prevent the commission of a violent crime.

If I understand his judgment correctly,
Mr. Justice Prowse purports to deal with the question on the basis of the mens
rea required for murder; a person who honestly, but erroneously, believes
that the force he is using is reasonable lacks the necessary intent for murder.
Mr. Justice Moir agreed with Justice Prowse’s conclusion but not his
reasoning. He based his judgment upon the fact that “even though there was an
intent to kill or injure it may be excused or forgiven because of the
surrounding mitigating circumstances” and hence the possibility of reducing the
charge of murder to manslaughter should be considered. An accused might apply
force knowing that the result would be death or grievous bodily injury. In this
sense, the accused would fall prima facie within the definition of
murder in s. 212. However, if the accused applied force under the honest
belief that it was necessary, then he could not be guilty of murder. Further,
it does not appear that this belief need be reasonably held. In these
circumstances the jury should ‘reduce’ the charge of murder to one of
manslaughter.

The issue raised by all three justices in the
Court of Appeal is whether murder is reduced to manslaughter when the defence
of justification in preventing the commission of a crime is advanced, and
excessive force is used. This is the first time in Canada, so far as I am
aware, that a partial defence under s. 27 of the Code has been
allowed to reduce what would otherwise be murder to manslaughter. The defence
of justification pursuant to s. 27  has hitherto been regarded as a total

[Page 298]

defence, entitling the accused to acquittal, or
no defence at all. There has been no half-way house.

III

The Crown appellant defined the issues on the
appeal as follows:

[1.] Did the Court of Appeal err in law in
holding that the common law concept of excessive force coupled with
self-defence reducing murder to manslaughter as developed in the law of Australia,
is applicable to a defence of justification in preventing the commission of an
offence and therefore the direction given to the jury constituted error in law
amounting to misdirection?

[2.] Did the Court of Appeal err in law in
holding that the law is the same in Canada as in Australia and that the honest
although mistaken belief that no more force is being used than is necessary is
a defence that reduces what would otherwise be murder to manslaughter and that
such defence is applicable by virtue of section 7(3)  of the Criminal
Code  to the defence of self-defence and therefore the direction given to
the jury constituted error in law amounting to misdirection?

[3.] Did the Court of Appeal err in holding
that excessive force used in self-defence or justification excuses murder and
reduces the crime to one of manslaughter even though the accused had the intent
to kill or injure and therefore the direction given to the jury constituted
error in law amounting to misdirection?

[4.] Did the Court of Appeal err in holding
that if the jury concludes the accused killed the victim and finds against the
accused on the issue of self-defence, then the issue of manslaughter should be
left with the jury with the following direction:

“if you believe the accused was acting
under a reasonable apprehension that another would suffer death or grievous
bodily harm, or if you are left with a reasonable doubt on the issue, then, if
the accused fails on the issue of self‑defence only because you conclude
that he used more force than reasonable in all the circumstances, you should
bring in a verdict of guilty of manslaughter.”

[Page 299]

and failure to do so constituted error in
law amounting to misdirection.

IV

The argument centered on the question of whether
excessive use of force in self-defence could reduce what would otherwise be
murder to manslaughter. The Crown appellant argued for a negative response. The
respondent Gee argued in the affirmative.

Australian, English and Canadian cases were
discussed at some length, in the context of the defence of self-defence,
although we are here concerned, not with a case of self-defence but excessive
force in the prevention of the commission of an indictable offence, that is to
say, to prevent the deceased Powley from continuing an aggravated assault upon
Racz. It is well to note the difference in statutory language between
s. 34 of the Code, self-defence, and s. 27 of the Code which
I have earlier set forth. Section 34  reads:

34. (1)
Every one who is unlawfully assaulted without having provoked the assault is
justified in repelling force by force if the force he uses is not intended to
cause death or grievous bodily harm and is no more than is necessary to enable
him to defend himself.

(2) Every one who is unlawfully assaulted
and who causes death or grievous bodily harm in repelling the assault is
justified if

(a) he causes it under
reasonable apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm from the violence with
which the assault was originally made or with which the assailant pursues his
purposes, and

(b) he believes, on
reasonable and probable grounds, that he cannot otherwise preserve himself from
death or grievous bodily harm.

The qualified defence of excessive force in
self-defence has been developed in some common law criminal jurisdictions and
has been applied by analogy to the defence of prevention of commission of a
crime (see R. v. McKay, [1957] V.R. 560). The gist of the respondent’s
argument is that, should a qualified defence of excessive force in self-defence
exist in Canada, by analogy, a qualified defence of excessive force in the
prevention of an offence should also be admitted. Such

[Page 300]

an analogy, however, may be more difficult to
make in a jurisdiction possessing a criminal code, as in Canada, where the two
defences are contained in two differently worded statutory provisions.

In the case of Brisson v. The Queen, [1982]
2 S.C.R. 227 judgment delivered concurrently herewith, I have expressed the
opinion that excessive force in self-defence, unless related to intent under
s. 212 of the Code or to provocation, does not reduce murder to
manslaughter. As I emphasized in the reasons in Brisson the distinction
between murder or manslaughter is one of intent. Intent is an element of the
offence of murder under s. 212  of the Criminal Code . A
determination with respect to the presence or absence of this intent must
underlie any consideration of the existence of a defence or justification. It
is the nature of the offence which determines what possible defences may be
open to the accused. For example, a “defence” of provocation under s. 215 
of the Criminal Code  is unnecessary where there is a finding of absence
of intent under s. 212 . The offence having been characterized as
manslaughter due to the absence of intent under s. 212 , it is simply
unnecessary to invoke a “defence” such as provocation which reduces murder to
manslaughter. Similarly, it is crucial to have characterized the offence as
murder or manslaughter before turning to s. 27 of the Code, the
defence of prevention of commission of an offence.

The starting point, in my view, is s. 212
of the Code combined with s. 205. According to the Code, s.
205, a person commits homicide, whether directly or indirectly, by any means
when he causes the death of a human being. Homicide is culpable or not
culpable. Homicide that is not culpable is not an offence. Culpable homicide is
murder or manslaughter when he causes the death of a human being in one of four
ways, of which s. 205(5)(a) is, for present purposes, relevant, “by
means of an unlawful act”. The effect of s. 27  is to justify the accused
in committing what would

[Page 301]

otherwise be an unlawful act. It makes lawful
what would otherwise be unlawful.

Turning then to s. 212 . Culpable homicide
is murder when the person who causes the death of a human being means to cause
death or means to cause bodily harm or knows that he will cause bodily harm and
is reckless whether death ensues or not.

Absent that intent, culpable homicide is
manslaughter or infanticide. The killing cannot be murder in the absence of
proof of intent required under s. 212 (a) of the Criminal Code  and
that intent may not be inferred merely from the fact of the killing. If the
Crown proves beyond a reasonable doubt a killing with such intent, or an
unlawful killing without such intent, i.e. the ingredients of murder or
manslaughter, respectively, it is then open to the accused to call in aid
s. 27 of the Code which I repeat for ease of reference:

27. Every
one is justified in using as much force as is reasonably necessary

(a) to prevent the commission of an
offence

(i) for which, if it were committed, the
person who committed it might be arrested without warrant, and

(ii) that would be likely to cause
immediate and serious injury to the person or property of anyone; or

(b) to prevent anything being
done that, on reasonable or probable grounds he believes would, if it were
done, be an offence mentioned in paragraph (a).

This section allows a justification for as
much force as is reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an
indictable offence. The section clearly contemplates the possibility of a
killing and can even extend its justification to killing with intent to kill,
if it is reasonably necessary. The question whether such force was or was not
reasonably necessary is one for the jury. If the force is reasonable in all the
circumstances the accused is entitled to an acquittal; if not, he is in my view

[Page 302]

guilty of murder if he has the required intent.
The jury function in applying the reasonableness test in the administration of
justice is stated in Halsbury’s Laws of England (4th ed.), vol. 11, at
p. 630 as follows:

In determining whether the force used was
reasonable the court will take into account all the circumstances of the case,
including the nature and degree of force used, the seriousness of the evil to
be prevented and the possibility of preventing it by other means. This
provision is of general application and is not limited to arrestable or any
other class of offences, but it would not be reasonable to use even slight
force to prevent very trivial offences. The circumstances in which it can be
considered reasonable to kill another in the prevention of crime must be of an
extreme kind; they could probably arise only in the case of an attack against
the person which is likely to cause death or serious bodily injury and where
killing the attacker is the only practicable means of preventing the harm. It
cannot be reasonable to kill another merely to prevent a crime which is
directed only against property.

Section 26 of the Code should be read in
conjunction with the passage from Halsbury. Section 26 provides that everyone
who is authorized to use force is criminally responsible for any excess thereof
according to the nature and quality of the act that constitutes the excess.

In my view, it cannot be said that force can be
partially justified. Success under s. 27  leads to acquittal. If the
defence under s. 27  does not succeed, the jury should render the verdict
which would have been rendered, absent s. 27 . This may be a verdict of
manslaughter, not because of partial justification under s. 27  but because
the special mental element required for guilt of murder has not been proven. In
other words, the half-way house is not to be found in s. 27  but, if at
all, in s. 212 .

For the above reasons I am of the opinion that
there does not exist in Canada a “qualified” defence of use of excessive force
in the prevention of the commission of an offence which would have

[Page 303]

the effect of reducing what would otherwise be
murder to manslaughter.

V

Charge to the Jury

Let me say immediately that the task of the
trial judge in charging the jury was by no means an easy one, having regard to
the uncertain state of the law at the time of trial and the generally prevailing
view that the principles applicable to the defences of self-defence and
prevention of the commission of a crime were, despite different statutory
provisions, to be found in the common law and were, to all intents, identical.

In my view the trial judge erred in two
respects, first, in charging on s. 34 of the Code and second, in
the inadequacy of the charge on s. 27 of the Code. There was no
evidence in the record from which a jury could reasonably infer that Gee, when
he assisted in killing Powley, did so under a reasonable apprehension of death
or grievous bodily harm or that he reasonably believed that he could not
otherwise save himself from bodily injury. Gee was entitled to have the jury
pass upon all his alternative defences but only where a foundation of fact
would give a reality to the defence. The only evidence to which the trial judge
referred was that both Gee and Racz had testified that Powley lunged at Gee and
kicked Fife. But as the trial judge herself observed, “Now, I think it is quite
clear that he [Powley] was not able to get away from Racz so that he could not
have carried out his purpose at the time in question”. Additionally, Gee
testified that following the lunge by Powley he, Gee, “ran right out of the
room”. The possibility of an encounter endangering Gee had therefore terminated
and with it any basis for a plea of self-defence. It was later, on his way
downstairs, that Gee heard a smash. He ran to the bar, grabbed a bottle, ran
upstairs and “smashed him [Powley] over the head with this bottle”.

[Page 304]

The judge charged at length on self-defence. In
so doing she instructed the jury that if they were of the view that the accused
used more force than was reasonably necessary to enable them to defend
themselves, the jury must find the accused not guilty of murder but guilty of
manslaughter. To this extent the charge was unduly favourable to the accused.
In devoting so much attention to self-defence the judge failed, however, to
direct adequate attention to the only possible ground of justification, namely
s. 27 , and the use of force to prevent the commission of an offence.

The charge on s. 27  was inadequate.
Reference was made only to s. 27 (a) and not to s. 21(b).
The jury was instructed that if “they were satisfied that the defence had
been established or if they had a reasonable doubt with respect to it they must
find the accused not guilty of murder”. The judge failed to instruct the jury
as to what would be the result if the accused failed in the defence under
s. 27 . On the recharge the judge stated, at p. 967 [of the Case on
Appeal]:

There are three circumstances under which
you must find the accused not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. If
you have a reasonable doubt with respect to the defence of self-defence, but
are satisfied that more force was used than was necessary, you must find the
accused not guilty of murder and guilty of manslaughter. If you have even a
reasonable doubt with respect to the defence of provocation, you must find the
accused not guilty of murder and guilty of manslaughter. If you are satisfied
that the accused committed culpable homicide, but have a reasonable doubt with
respect to whether they committed murder, then you must find the accused not
guilty of murder and guilty of manslaughter.

There is reference in the passage to excessive
force in self-defence and to provocation but no reference to s. 27 . It is
not made clear that if justification under s. 27  did not succeed the
verdict would be murder or manslaughter depending upon the presence or absence
of intent under s. 212 . Gee testified that he told Susan Fife not to stab
Powley and “only to try and knock him out”. The question of intent and the
possibility of a manslaughter

[Page 305]

verdict if s. 27  failed was therefore in
issue. The judge did not at any time relate s. 27  to absence of intent.

The jury were confused as to the distinction
between murder and manslaughter. In the course of their deliberations they
asked twice for a redirection with respect to the distinction. Only in the
second redirection did the trial judge specifically state that “The difference
between murder and manslaughter is one of intent”. I am not convinced that at
this point in the deliberations this statement of the distinction was
sufficient to overcome the deficiencies in the charge as a whole, especially
when, as here, the charge has been complicated by the introduction of the
defence of self-defence and the erroneous concept as to the “qualified” defence
of excessive force reducing murder to manslaughter in that part of the charge.
The result was to introduce a potential for confusion, the full effect of which
no one can assess, and to divert attention from s. 212  and the potentially
broad scope of s. 27 of the Code.

In the result I would dismiss the appeal and confirm
the order for a new trial but for the reasons given above.

LIM TEONG QWEE JC
 The plaintiffs in both actions claim as owners or as persons entitled to the immediate possession or as consignees of the cargo shipped on board the vessel `Jambo` at ports in Thailand for carriage to and discharge at ports in China. The first defendant in Suit No 2077/94 (Brendon Shipping) was the owner of the vessel at the time of shipment and the second defendant (Paciro Shipping) was its agent. The third defendant (Wee) was the managing director of Brendon Shipping and held 50% of its issued capital. He was also the managing director of Paciro Shipping and held 90% of its issued capital. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants wrongfully sold the cargo to the defendants in Suit No 420/95 or one or more of them. They claim damages for conversion of the cargo against the defendants in both actions.
 2.The two actions were consolidated but shortly after the first defendant in Suit No 420/95 had given evidence that action was settled. In Suit No 2077/94 there was an alternative claim against Brendon Shipping for damages for breach of duty as bailee for reward and breach of contract of carriage but that claim was not proceeded with as the action only proceeded as against Paciro Shipping and Wee. At the conclusion of the trial I gave judgment for the plaintiffs against Paciro Shipping and Wee. These are my grounds.
 3.It was not disputed that the cargo was shipped on board the Jambo as alleged and that the plaintiffs were the holders of the bills of lading in respect of the cargo. In fact other goods were also shipped on board the vessel for the same voyage and the plaintiffs were not entitled to the entire cargo but for convenience I shall refer to the plaintiffs` goods as their cargo as they have been so referred to by the parties in these proceedings. The Jambo sailed from the Thai port of Songkhla on 15 June 1993 but returned to port shortly after and did not complete the contemplated voyage. It was admitted by Wee that the cargo was sold to the second defendant in Suit No 420/95 under two contracts both dated 13 December 1993. The seller in each contract was Brendon Shipping. Each was signed for the seller by Wee over the name `AJ Brendon Shipping Pte Ltd`. The defendants` case in Suit No 2077/94 is that the plaintiffs had abandoned their cargo and the defendants were entitled to sell it. The alternative case is that the defendants were agents of necessity of the plaintiffs for the purpose of disposing of their cargo.
 4.
 Abandonment
Mr Leong`s submission is that the plaintiffs knew of the casualty and that they knew of the claims of MN Offshore Services (salvors) and of Chaophaya Terminal International Co Ltd (CTIC) the port operator at Songkhla. Brendon Shipping signed an agreement with the salvors on 18 June 1993 for the salvage of the Jambo and its cargo `that on the 15 June 1993 called for assistance, after starting to list 10 degrees to the starboard side` according to what is stated in the agreement. Paciro Shipping signed an agreement with CTIC on 29 June 1993 for port and warehousing services at Songkhla after the Jambo had returned to port. It is said that the plaintiffs also knew of the deterioration of the cargo and the freight costs to reship to Chinese ports. The plaintiffs were themselves `sourcing the market for buyers`. The inference so the argument goes is that the plaintiffs had made a commercial decision that it was not economically viable to reship the cargo to the original destination. It was also submitted that the plaintiffs` delay or failure in providing general average security was a further indication of their intention to abandon the cargo.
 5.I will consider the question of the furnishing of security first. Paciro Shipping as agent of the ship owner Brendon Shipping appointed Richards Hogg International (RHI) as general average adjusters. On 2 July 1993 RHI wrote to cargo interests (including the plaintiffs). Part of the letter said: 
The vessel loaded approximately 3,444 tons of rubber and 3,100 tons of polyester chips at Laemchbang and Songkhla, Thailand. At approximately 0730 hours on 15.6.93, the vessel departed Songkhla for her two ports of destination, Xingang and Dalien. It is noted from the master`s report that at approximately 0800 hours, the vessel touched ground and soon thereafter commenced listing towards her starboard side. The list became severe (approximately 35 to 40) and it was apparent that water had entered the vessel, at hold no 1.
 
A salvage contract was signed by the ship managers with a salvor in Thailand on a lump sum basis. At the time of sending this message, salvage operations continue to be performed and it is the ship managers` intention to discharge cargo at Songkhla, repair the vessel, reload the cargo, and continue with the original voyage.
 
As a result of the above, the ship managers have declared general average. It is therefore necessary for the consignees and their insurers to provide satisfactory general average security to us prior to delivery of the cargo at destination.
 `Ship managers` was a reference to Paciro Shipping. Blank forms of average guarantee and Lloyd`s average bond were enclosed. Both were expressed to be given in consideration of delivery of the goods. Mr Chia Jiew Chein Gerry was the adjusting manager of RHI in 1993. He said that RHI did not prepare any general average adjustment for the casualty. He was referred to a letter dated 12 October 1993 written by him in which RHI said: 
Kindly take note that we have ceased all work as shipowners have not paid our interim account for extensive work that has been carried out by us.
 It was not disputed that by that date RHI had ceased all work for the shipowner and no other average adjuster had been appointed in their place.
 6.The plaintiffs` cargo was not lost in the casualty or sacrificed whether or not for the purpose of preserving the ship or any other cargo that might have been imperilled. The defendants allege that Brendon Shipping incurred expenditure of a general average nature but no demand had at any time at all been made for payment of the correct amount payable by any of the plaintiffs. General average was never adjusted at all. In these circumstances all that Brendon Shipping had was a possessory lien on the plaintiffs` cargo for the amount if any that was properly payable. This position was well appreciated by RHI who called for satisfactory general average security to be provided 
 prior to delivery of the cargo at destination 
. There was no evidence of any change in the position. There was no obligation on the part of the plaintiffs to provide any security before Brendon Shipping was ready to deliver the cargo. There was no failure or delay on the part of the plaintiffs to provide general average security. In fact all the plaintiffs other than the sixth plaintiff did provide security by way of the average guarantee.
 7.I turn now to Mr Leong`s main submission. The plaintiffs were informed of the casualty and through their insurers they retained Clyde & Co a firm of solicitors in England with a South East Asia office in Singapore (Clyde (Singapore)). Clyde (Singapore) instructed CCIC (Thailand) Co Ltd (CCIC) of Bangkok to make certain inquiries. On 8 October 1993 Clyde (Singapore) wrote to CCIC: 
1 Please let us know the current whereabouts of the cargo and its condition. 
2 We understand from our telephone conversation that the port authority and the salvage company are claiming a fee from cargo interests. Please confirm the position and indicate the level of the fee that has been requested. 
3 Please confirm whether the port authority/salvors have refused to release the cargo until such a fee is paid. 
4 Please let us know the current status of the vessel and whether she is under arrest by the port authority or, alternatively, when she is due to sail. 
5 We should be grateful if you would let us know whether the identity of any lawyers acting for either the port authority, the salvors, or the shipowners.
 8.On 9 October 1993 CCIC passed on to Clyde (Singapore) this information received from the port director of CTIC: 
A agreement was made between ship`s owner and the port concerning to port services required, port charge rates, and payment. Ship`s owner agreed that all the port charges payment would be fully paid before vessel sailing. The up-to-date outstanding debts which ship`s owner owed to the Port is amounting to 12 million bahts. According to our stands, the vessel and cargoes will not be released until the payment being fully paid to our Port.
 
It was said that ship`s owner also owed a amount of more than 30 millions to [the salvors] for their salvage costs.
 9.In the course of the next few days there was an exchange of letters between them. On 12 October 1993 Clyde (Singapore) wrote: 
We attach for your information copies of the Salvage Agreement and Certificate of Termination of Salvage, supplied by the salvors` solicitors. As far as we are aware, cargo interests were not consulted in respect of the salvage agreement and we wish to reserve our clients` right to argue that they are not bound by that agreement.
 
However, we consider the immediate problem is to establish the level of payments that would be required by the Port Authority and the salvors from the cargo interests in order to release the cargo. Our clients will need to know this and also the value of the cargo in its present condition so that they may consider whether it will be economically viable to attempt to re-ship the cargo to destination.
 
In the circumstances, we should be grateful if you would make immediate arrangements to travel to Songkhla and make the following enquiries: 
1 The level of payment that will be demanded by the port authority from cargo interests in respect of this casualty and whether the port authority would accept a part payment from cargo, even if the shipowners have not agreed to pay the balance of the port dues. In other words, will the port authority consider a separate deal with cargo interests that does not involve the shipowners? 
2 The level of the demand of salvors in respect of cargo and whether salvors would consider a separate deal which does not involve shipowners. We understand that salvors may not be entitled to exercise a lien over the cargo. We are investigating this but you should bear this in mind in any discussions you may have. 
3 The value of the cargo in its present condition. 
4 The residual value of the ship in her present condition. 
5 The likely costs and logistical steps necessary to re-sort and re-load the cargo onto a transhipment vessel, including freight charges.
 10.On 13 October 1993 CCIC wrote: 
We estimate that the value of the cargo in its present condition is as follows:
 
Cargo Remains
Amount Insured
Devaluation Rate
Rubber
USD1,464,828.00
40%-60%
USD 732,414.00
Polyester Chips
USD1,931,325.00
55%
USD 869,096.30
Total
USD1,601,510.30
 
The residual value of the ship in her present condition is about USD800,000 to USD1,000,000, according to the Songkhla Port Authority`s estimating.
 
The cost of re-load the cargo onto a transhipment vessel:
 
If rubber, port`s fee: USD1.00/MT, vessel`s freight: USD34/MT prepaid.
 
If polyester chips: vessel`s freight: USD36/MT.
 11.On 14 October 1993 Clyde (Singapore) wrote: 
One point we would ask you to bear in mind is that we do not necessarily accept that cargo interests owe any moneys to either the salvors or the port authority. At this stage, we are anxious to learn what sums the port and the salvage company would accept to release the cargo, but these enquiries must be without prejudice to cargo interests` legal rights.
 12.On 14 October 1993 CCIC passed on to Clyde (Singapore) part of a letter of the same date from CTIC to Paciro Shipping: 
we request that you provide us a cash payment with an amount of THB18,800,000 before the cargo reloading to any other replaced vessel.
 
The total amount of port service charges up to 20 October 1993 including the cargo reloading on to the replace vessel is estimated to be THB18,800,000.
 
You are requested to confirm by return fax or telex before 12:00 on 15 October 1993. Should you fail to do that, we shall have to take necessary actions.
 13.The same day Clyde (Singapore) wrote: 
Please explain who [Paciro Shipping] are, and who they represent in this matter. Furthermore, we should be grateful if you could clarify whether the figure of THB18,000,800 includes the charges incurred by the ship whilst alongside the wharf, or whether they relate only to cargo handling/storage charges.
 They followed up the next day with another letter: 
We note from your fax of yesterday that the Port Authority have set a deadline for [Paciro Shipping] to respond by 1200 hours today.
 
In the circumstances, please make urgent telephone enquiries of the Port Director to find out what they intend doing with the cargo. We suspect that the `necessary actions` referred to by the Port Authority may include sale of the cargo. If this is the case, please explain to the Port Director that we have only just been instructed in this matter and request that he takes no immediate steps in respect of the cargo.
 14.On 15 October 1993 CCIC passed on part of a letter from CTIC to CCIC: 
In response to your fax of 14 October 1993, the following is for your information:
 
Mr Jacky Wee, Managing Director of [Paciro Shipping] is the actual owner of MV Jambo. All the salvage services we provided were applied by him or his representative.
 
THB18,800,000 is including cargo reloading from the port onto the replaced vessel and the cargo storage fee is calculated as up to 20 October 1993. The port charges incurred mostly is cargo storage charge, partly incurred by labour services charge and services related to vessel operations.
 
Please note the cargo storage now is costed about THB190,000 per day.
 Later the same day CCIC passed on part of a letter received from the salvors: 
We would be delighted to consider a separate deal with the cargo interests which does not involve the shipowner, but will at first consult our lawyers.
 
We are prepared to release the cargo on an immediate payment to our bank account the sum of S$3.5m which could be the basis of a security/salvage arbitration possibly involving Clyde & Co in London.
 15.On 15 October 1993 Clyde (Singapore) wrote to CCIC: 
We note the position that has been adopted by [the salvors]. In view of the unreasonableness of the position they are adopting, we see no benefit in your communicating with them any further for the time being.
 16.At about this point in time the position as seen by the plaintiffs might have been something like this. Their cargo was worth about US$1.6m. CTIC`s claim down to 20 October 1993 was 18,800,000 baht or about US$740,000. The salvors` claim was $2.5m or about US$1.8m although they asked for $3.5m or about US$2.5m. The aggregate of the claims exceeded the value of the plaintiffs` cargo by about US$1m or more. It was submitted that it was not economically viable to reship the cargo for carriage to the original destination. That may well be so but it is quite another thing to say that the plaintiffs must have decided or intended to abandon their cargo. The cargo had some value. It had deteriorated but there was no evidence that it had become unsaleable at any time. If the plaintiffs were liable to contribute in general average the liability would not be discharged or in any way affected by their abandoning their cargo. Their loss could only be increased by its value if they elected to abandon it. The cargo was in the possession of CTIC. The salvors had given up possession but they would have a maritime lien for salvage services. CTIC had given notice of `necessary actions` and it was not unlikely that such actions would include sale. Again the plaintiffs` loss could not be diminished by any renunciation of the value of the cargo. Whether or not they were liable to contribute in general average or for port or warehousing services in no way at all could abandonment of the cargo improve their position. Above all it was Brendon Shipping that was primarily liable and its vessel estimated by CTIC to be worth US$800,000 to US$1m was also at risk and it was Paciro Shipping`s intention expressed through RHI in their letter of 2 July 1993 to continue the original voyage. In these cricumstances it cannot be inferred that the plaintiffs had intended to abandon their cargo and in my judgment the defence of abandonment has not been made good.
 17.
 Agency of necessity
Contrary to the expressed intention of Paciro Shipping the Jambo was not repaired, the cargo was not reloaded and the original voyage was not continued. The cargo ex Jambo was loaded onto the `Ryong Nam San` but the plaintiffs were not informed by Paciro Shipping or Wee of the shipment of their cargo. On 14 January 1994 Clyde (Singapore) wrote to Paciro Shipping for the attention of Wee: 
We understand that the cargo ex-`Jambo` has been loaded on to a vessel called the `Ryong Namsan`, which vessel we understand is bound for Xingang. We would be grateful if you could provide us with the position of the `Ryong Namsan` and her estimated time of arrival at Xingang.
 
We would also be grateful if you could provide us with copies of the bills of lading that were issued by the `Ryong Namsan` for this cargo.
 Wee said he did not recall having received this at about that time and only first saw it in preparing for trial.
 18.On 27 January 1994 Clyde (Singapore) again wrote to Paciro Shipping for the attention of Wee: 
I refer to our meeting yesterday where you confirmed to me that this cargo has been sold to Cosco, Jakarta. You also mentioned that you are in the process of preparing detailed accounts regarding the sale of this cargo and I would be grateful if you could let me have a copy of these accounts as soon as they become available.
 Again Wee said he did not recall having received this at about that time. He also denied having met with Mr Rawlings of Clyde (Singapore) who wrote the letter. The cargo had in fact been sold by this time.
 19.Mr Leong referred to 
Munro v Willmott
 
[1948] 2 All ER 983
 where Lynskey J said at pp 985-986: 
I am very doubtful if the doctrine of agent of necessity can be applied to a case of goods stored in premises, but, if it can, it can only be applied in a case of real emergency which necessitates the disposal of the goods.
 In 
 Munro 
 the plaintiff`s motor car had been parked at the defendant`s premises along with a caravan (in which she lived with her mother and stepfather) and two lorries used in her stepfather`s business and when the family moved to another location in the course of the business they took everything with them except the motor car which was not in working condition and was unlicensed. The defendant allowed it to be left there without charge. That was in about September 1942. In December 1945 he sold the car as it was causing difficulty to other vehicles. He did not know the plaintiff`s address and he had tried unsuccessfully to contact her stepfather. The learned judge referred to 
Sachs v Miklos & Ors
 
[1948] 1 All ER 67
 where Lord Goddard CJ said at p 68: 
Agents of necessity, until very modern times, were confined to two classes of persons, those who accepted bills of exchange for the honour of the payee and masters of ships who found themselves in foreign parts and unable to get immediate instructions from their owners when they wanted money for unlooked-for expenses and so forth. They then had power to pledge, sell, or hypothecate the ship, and, in some cases, to deal with the cargo as agents of necessity.
 He was not satisfied that there was any emergency and concluded that the defendant was not justified in selling the car as an agent of necessity.
 20.Mr Leong also referred to 
Burns Philp & Co Ltd v Gillespie Bros Pty Ltd
 
[1947] 
74 CLR 148
 and in particular to two passages from the judgment of Latham CJ at p 172 where he said: 
In my opinion what is said in 
Cargo ex `Argos`
 
[1873] LR 5 PC 134
 shows that there is no absolute duty resting upon the master of a vessel in all cases to communicate with the owners of goods before he takes action in the interests of the owners of the goods to save the goods from loss or destruction.
 and at p 177 where he said: 
If propositions nos 1 and 2 are rejected (as in my opinion they should be) then proposition no 3 must be accepted. Upon this view there is a duty arising from necessity and created by law, not by agreement of the parties, to act reasonably and prudently in the interests of the cargo-owner in an emergency which threatens the loss or destruction of the cargo, even though the contract makes no provision dealing with such a case.
 Proposition no 1 is that the master has no right (and a fortiori no duty) to do anything with respect to the cargo unless it is required or at least authorised by some provision in the terms of the contract. Proposition no 2 is that the master is entitled but not bound to take any reasonable and prudent though uncovenanted action in order to preserve the cargo. Mr Leong`s argument as I understand it is that Brendon Shipping as the shipowner had a duty to act reasonably and prudently in the interests of the plaintiffs as owners of the cargo in an emergency and there was no duty in this case to communicate with them before it sold the cargo. I should point out that the judgment of Latham CJ was a dissenting judgment and the question in issue before the court was whether the carrier was entitled to `back freight` ie freight for carrying the shipper`s goods back to the port of loading if the voyage back was undertaken for the security of the ship and cargo considered as one adventure in the sense of the interests afloat considered as one unit and not undertaken for the purpose of preserving the shipper`s goods. Agency of necessity if it was relevant was not really in issue as it was found as a fact that the master (as he was informed) could not communicate with the owners of the goods. See per Starke J at p 184 and see also per Dixon J at p 191.
 21.The Jambo sailed from Songkhla at about 0730 hours on 15 June 1993 and at about 0800 hours `the vessel touched ground and soon thereafter commenced listing` according to the letter of RHI dated 2 July 1993. On 18 June 1993 Brendon Shipping entered into a salvage agreement with the salvors and the vessel was towed to port. The vessel was handed back to Brendon Shipping`s representative on 29 June 1993 at 0800 hours as stated in an agreement between the salvors and Brendon Shipping dated 28 June 1993. For the next five months until the shipment on board the Ryong Nam San the plaintiffs` cargo was at Songkhla in the possession of CTIC under an agreement for port and warehousing services. There was no evidence of any present or imminent danger to the cargo except possibly for the risk of sale or other enforcement procedures by CTIC or the salvors for the indebtedness of Brendon Shipping. In these circumstances I am far from being satisfied that there was any emergency in any sense. There was certainly no emergency that threatened the loss or destruction of the cargo after the Jambo had been towed back to port and the cargo had been discharged. In my opinion 
 Sachs 
, 
 Munro 
 and 
 Burns Philp 
 do not assist the defendants.
 22.On 15 October 1993 Brendon Shipping in a letter signed by Wee advised CTIC that it was intended `to berth the vessel MV Sulteng I alongside [on that day] to load approximately 3000 tonnes of rubber only`. That included the plaintiffs` cargo. Wee`s evidence under cross-examination was: 
Q: Page 394. Agree that on 15 October 1993 you agreed for this cargo to be sold for purchaser to pay port charges and your agents` fees? 
A: Yes. 
Q: You signed as director of AJ Brendon? 
A: Yes. 
Q: 15 October 1993. You decided to sell cargo? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Decision to sell. Yesterday said in December 1993? 
A: In October 1993 salvors secured buyers and asked me to help them. So I had to say yes to sale to help them. December 1993. Decision was taken on my own. Not at salvors` insistence.
 Wee had decided to sell the plaintiffs` cargo as early as mid-October 1993. That sale fell through because CTIC refused to release the cargo. Wee said under cross-examination that he was not aware of this in October 1993 but he was subsequently informed by CTIC. There was no evidence that Brendon Shipping or Paciro Shipping or Wee or any other person attempted to communicate with any of the plaintiffs to seek their instructions or authority to sell the cargo or deal with it in any other way.
 23.Wee knew that he had to come to terms with CTIC if Brendon Shipping or the salvors wished to sell the cargo. On 10 December 1993 he signed an agreement with CTIC as the representative of Brendon Shipping and Paciro Shipping. Essentially the agreement provided for payment of 23 million baht to CTIC for its charges to facilitate the shipment of the cargo by a substitute vessel. The vessel was not named although it was going to be the Ryong Nam San.
 24.Wee admitted under cross-examination that he received a draft of this agreement on 7 December 1993 and that it was Mr George Then (the first defendant in Suit No 420/95) who gave it to him. He said there were no negotiations between CTIC and the two companies he represented. He went to Songkhla to sign the agreement. This was his evidence: 
Q: When at port authority`s office? 
A: Can`t recall but must be on date we signed agreement ie 10 December 1993. 
Q: At port authority`s office. `We were all present`. Who? 
A: Myself, Peter Tauro of salvors, purchaser Mr Nilam and George Then representing purchaser. Also my port agent Mr Lian and Mr Jin representing CTIC. Mr Jin is based in Singapore. Mr Tao Jun also. 
A: I don`t think I had draft agreement with me. I did not see anyone else with draft. Mr Tao Jun and Mr Jin discussed with Mr Nilam. I cannot recall joining in the discussions. They reached an agreement. Agreement was in accordance with agreement signed. Agreement in the form as signed was brought to the meeting. From beginning. If I recall it was brought by Mr Tao Jun. Can`t recall if it was amended but it could have been. I was party but not interested. I was reluctant party. Just to help them out.
 Mr Tao Jun was the port director of CTIC. It was undoubtedly the buyer who was providing the funds to pay CTIC. The salvors were an interested party. When `they reached an agreement` the agreement of 10 December 1993 was signed.
 25.The two agreements for the sale of the plaintiffs` cargo were both dated 13 December 1993. Wee signed for Brendon Shipping in both agreements. Under cross-examination he said: 
Q: Amendment. Clause 3. One of two signatures. Yours? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Next to yours? 
A: Purchaser. Don`t know who signed. Contract was brought to me already signed by purchaser. Words in cl 3. I deleted because I take it they want to sell my vessel. 
 
Q: Clause 3. When agreement brought to you. Signature of purchaser there? 
A: Don`t remember but don`t think it was there. 
Q: Right to say counter-signature of purchaser was after you deleted words in cl 3? 
A: Believe so. 
 
Q: 13 December 1993. You were in Songkhla? 
A: Can`t remember. 
Q: Know if any of purchaser`s representatives were in Songkhla on 13 December 1993? 
A: Don`t know. 
Q: Contracts brought to you. In Singapore or Songkhla? 
A: Can`t recall.
 Clause 3 before the amendment provided `Time of Sale. Upon signing of contract and signing of Bill of Sale.` The last six words were deleted. Wee was not selling `my [his] vessel`.
 26.I should think that the buyer would be reluctant to commit himself to buy the cargo unless terms were agreed with CTIC so that it could be shipped and he would be even more reluctant to commit himself to provide funds to pay CTIC unless the sale was concluded. The likelihood is that the CTIC agreement of 10 December 1993 and the two sale agreements of 13 December 1993 were signed at about the same time but intended to take effect one after the other.
 27.I now come to the `substitute vessel` that was not named in the CTIC agreement of 10 December 1993. On 9 December 1993 ie the day before Wee was in Songkhla to sign the agreement with CTIC he wrote to Songkhla Eastern Maritime Ltd for the attention of Mr Lian (his port agent): 
After successful negotiations with the port of Songkhla regarding the port charges of M/V Jambo, we have reached an agreement where they agreed to release the cargoes back to me.
 
I have already arrange a substitute vessel to load the cargo from M/V Jambo from the port and then she can complete her voyage to China.
 Under cross-examination Wee said: 
Q: 9 December 1993. You intended to complete voyage to China? That Jambo should proceed to China from Songkhla? 
A: Can`t remember. Should be no because vessel was not in a position to sail. 
Q: 9 December 1993. You intended to arrange for substitute vessel to carry goods to China? 
A: No. 
Q: 9 December 1993. Had you already decided cargo would be sold? 
A: Presume so. Contract was not signed yet. Until purchaser could prove they could fulfill obligations to port to pay all charges.
 It was not intended by Wee that the Jambo should complete the voyage and carry the cargo to the original destination.
 28.Later under further cross-examination Wee said: 
Q: 1PB-281. You sent this to your Songkhla agent on 9 December 1993? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Paragraph 2. Untrue? 
A: Untrue. 
Q: Not arranged substitute vessel? 
A: I did not. 
Q: Vessel not proceeding to China? 
A: No.
 Wee agreed that para 2 was untrue. The substitute vessel was not proceeding to China. The plaintiffs` cargo was not going to be carried to the original destination. Wee said he did not arrange for substitute vessel. He himself did not do so. He said: 
Q: 9 December 1993. Substitute vessel already arranged? 
A: Don`t know. 
Q: When you were first informed substitute vessel arranged to load cargo ex Jambo at Songkhla? 
A: 10 December 1993. After signing agreement in port authority`s office in Songkhla. 
Q: Who informed you? 
A: Purchaser. Can`t recall who. I try my best. Should be Mr Nilam. 
Q: You were given name of substitute vessel? 
A: Yes, but I was really not interested. Not interested to know. 
Q: Substitute vessel. Ryong Nam San? 
A: Yes.
 29.The first defendant in Suit No 420/95 (Mr George Then) was referred to a fixture note dated 7 December 1993 between Goodstar Shipping Ltd as disponent owner and Cosco Shipping Inc (the second defendant in Suit No 420/95) as charterer. This was his evidence: 
Q: Ryong Nam San was chartered by Cosco to load cargo ex Songkhla? 
A: Chartered by A J Brendon. 
Q: 1DB-88/89. Fixture note concluded between Cosco and Goodstar for charter of Ryong Nam San? 
A: Can`t remember. 
 
Q: Agree on 7 December 1993you were aware that Cosco chartered Ryong Nam San from Goodstar? 
A: No. 
Q: Aware when agreement was signed between CTIC and A J Brendon and Paciro on 10 December 1993that Ryong Nam San was chartered by Cosco from Goodstar? 
A: 10 December 1993. I was aware that vessel was chartered. Not aware if chartered by Cosco. I was aware that vessel was chartered from Goodstar. Can`t remember if I was aware of fixture note 1DB-88/89 dated 7 December 1993. 
 
Q: Nilam Antartrans (S) Pte Ltd. Broker in charter? 
A: Yes, but acting for AJ Brendon.
 Shortly after he had testified the hearing was adjourned and Suit No 420/95 was settled. He was not cross-examined by counsel for Paciro Shipping and Wee.
 30.Clause 11 of the fixture note provided: 
Bills of Lading: lst set Bs/L to state China as port of discharging. Master/crew to be informed that cargo is bound for China only. 
After vessel has left `Songkhla` port, then vessel/master will be told to divert to Singapore. 
2nd set switch Bs/L to be issued in Singapore by owner`s sub-agent against charterer`s letter of indemnity in owner`s wordings and T/T remittance of freight payment of original bank slip.
 The charterer named in the fixture note was Cosco Shipping Inc which was the buyer of the plaintiffs` cargo. Upon shipment all documentation would show that the cargo was to be carried to China but bills of lading would be switched and the vessel would sail for Singapore.
 31.I return now to Wee`s evidence in regard to the letter of 9 December 1993 he sent to Mr Lian: 
Q: Why was your agent told substitute vessel would complete voyage to China when this was untrue? 
A: Purchaser was worried agent might not co-operate with us. By `us` I mean ship owner, purchaser, salvors. 
 
Q: 1PB-281. Copy to CTIC? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Purchasers were also worried port authority might not co-operate with them, ship owner and salvors? 
A: No. Port authority was interested in getting their fees paid. 
Q: You agree that your agent at Songkhla Eastern Maritime would only be interested in getting their agency fees paid? 
A: No. Purchasers were afraid because my agent is Thai and shippers are also Thais. They were worried agent might leak information to shippers of cargo to stop loading on substitute vessel for re-shipment. 
Q: You agree that purpose of fax 1PB-281 was also to conceal fact that cargo already sold by you? 
A: No. Mr Lian (agent) was also party to contract signed with port authority on 10 December 1993. 
Q: Contract 10 December 1993 makes reference to cargo having been sold by AJ Brendon? 
A: No. 
Q: Your agent was informed by you on 10 December 1993 that cargo had been sold? 
A: Can`t recall. 
Q: 13 December 1993? When sale and purchase contracts were signed? 
A: Can`t recall. 
Q: You agree that purpose of fax sent to your agent was if cargo interests made inquiries of your agent they would be informed substitute vessel bound for China? 
A: No.
 32.Wee sold the plaintiffs` cargo. By 9 December 1993 he had done so although the sale agreements had yet to be signed. He knew a substitute vessel had been arranged. The cargo would be shipped on board this vessel. He knew it was not going to the original destination. He also knew that he had to tell his port agent at Songkhla that the substitute vessel would go to China or the port agent might not `co-operate`. Mr Lian was aware of the agreement of 10 December 1993 with CTIC but Wee could not recall if he informed him the cargo had been sold. I think he would not have told him that. That would be altogether wholly inconsistent with his letter to him on 9 December 1993 that CTIC had agreed `to release the cargoes back to [him]` to be loaded on a substitute vessel to `complete her voyage to China`. I think he did not tell Mr Lian that he had sold the cargo.
 33.The original shippers also were not to know the truth. The buyers were worried that Mr Lian would leak the information to the shippers to stop the cargo from being loaded on board the Ryong Nam San. Wee would not let the shippers know that the cargo had been sold and that it was not going to China and he would certainly not want them to know that before the Ryong Nam San had sailed with the cargo on board. He would have been much less inclined to let the plaintiffs know. I think he did not want the plaintiffs to know that he had sold the cargo. He did not want them to know it before the Ryong Nam San sailed with the plaintiffs` cargo on board. He did not want them to know that he was going to sell the cargo. He did not communicate with them for instructions to sell the cargo at any time at all and no one else did that.
 34.There are only seven plaintiffs. There was not such a large number of owners of the cargo that they could not be conveniently reached. The cargo manifest produced by Wee identified the shippers and consignees or parties to be notified. There were only 18 cargo interests covering the entire cargo shipped on board the Jambo including the plaintiffs` cargo. The average adjusters RHI had been in communication with the plaintiffs. Wee instructed Ince & Co a firm of English solicitors with an office in Singapore. In a letter dated 6 July 1993 Ince & Co said it was understood that the majority of cargo interests were insured with PICC. Wee could have communicated with the plaintiffs through the shippers or consignees or parties to be notified or through RHI or through Ince & Co or through PICC.
 35.It was not impossible to communicate with the plaintiffs or `practically impossible` or `commercially impossible` to do so. They could be `conveniently communicated with`. There was every `opportunity to consult` with them. See 
 Bowstead & Reynolds on Agency 
 (16th Ed) at p 148 rule (a) and the authorities referred to. There was no emergency and the circumstances were not such as to excuse any of the defendants from communicating with the plaintiffs for instructions to sell or otherwise dispose of the cargo. No attempt has been made to communicate with the plaintiffs for any such instructions and in my judgment the defence of agency of necessity fails.
 36.
 Liability of Paciro Shipping and Wee
Wee was the managing director of both Brendon Shipping and Paciro Shipping. He was the one who took the decision to sell the plaintiffs` cargo. He knew that the plaintiffs or the shippers of the cargo had not authorised him or either of the companies to sell the cargo. He had to arrange with Mr Lian for the cargo to be shipped on the Ryong Nam San and before the agreements for the sale of the cargo had been signed he actively concealed the truth by writing the letter to Mr Lian containing what he knew to be untrue. Brendon Shipping and Paciro Shipping both acting by Wee were parties to the agreement of 10 December 1993 with CTIC which was interdependent one on the other with the two agreements of 13 December 1993 for sale of the cargo for their performance. In my judgment each of them Paciro Shipping and Wee were liable for the conversion of the plaintiffs` cargo. See 
Wah Tat Bank Ltd & Anor v Chan Cheng Kum
 
[1975] AC 507
.
 37.There was no dispute as to the value of the plaintiffs` cargo at the time of the sale. Plaintiffs` counsel provided an estimate which appeared to be based on prices lower than the prices at which the cargo was sold. I accordingly gave judgment for the plaintiffs each for the respective value of its cargo as shown in the estimate together with interest at 6% per annum from the date of the writ to the date of judgment and costs against each of them Paciro Shipping and Wee.",1998-04-13 00:00:00,SG High Court

                   The judgment of the
Court was delivered orally by

 

                   Major J. ‑‑ The appellant raised
two principal grounds of appeal:

 

(1)               
Initially the appellant submitted that the Alberta Court of Appeal erred in
holding that the Crown's appeal involved a question of law.

 

                   We do not agree
that there was an error of law.  The substance of this ground of appeal is
whether as a matter of law there can be a recantation of perjury within the
same hearing, the effect of which would be to nullify the prior finding of the
completed offence.  This in our opinion is a question of law.

 

(2)
The second ground is that recantation of perjury can provide a defence.

 

                   In our opinion the
finding of fact by the trial judge, with which we cannot interfere, that the
accused intended initially to mislead the Court, coupled with the other
findings of falsehood under oath, results in a conclusion that at that point
the offence was complete.  A later recantation under the circumstances of this
case would not, as a matter of logic, negate an earlier intention to mislead.

 

                   Compelling evidence
dealing with the good but misguided motive of the accused should, as stated by
the Court of Appeal, undoubtedly count positively in his favour towards
sentence.

 

                   We therefore agree
with the conclusion of the Alberta Court of Appeal and the appeal is dismissed.

Criminal law -- Evidence -- Post-offence conduct --
Charge to jury -- Accused charged with first degree murder -- Accused fleeing
jurisdiction, running from police and attempting to dispose of murder weapon
after victim was killed -- Whether trial judge should have instructed jury that
post-offence conduct had no probative value -- Whether trial judge should have
instructed jury to apply reasonable doubt standard to evidence of accused’s
post-offence conduct.

 








The accused, W and C, were charged with first degree
murder.  The victim’s body was discovered near Ottawa.  He had been shot twice
with a shotgun and four times with a pistol.  He had last been seen alive the
previous evening in the company of the two accused.  W and C left the Ottawa area
soon after the murder.  Two days later they robbed a bank in the Toronto area
and one week later robbed the same bank again.  During these robberies C fired
a shotgun and a pistol, and left behind shells and cartridge cases that matched
those found at the murder scene.  The accused admitted the facts concerning
both robberies, but denied any involvement in the murder.  At trial, the Crown
introduced the following evidence indicating that the departure of the accused
from Ottawa following the murder constituted flight from the area:  the fact
that the accused remained away for more than ten days, missed parole meetings
and failed to pick up a social assistance cheque; the fact that, according to
an acquaintance who testified as a Crown witness, C called to inquire about
“heat” in Ottawa and to instruct his landlord to pack up his belongings; W’s
comments to the acquaintance that he needed a car and money to go away; and the
commission of the two bank robberies.  The Crown also introduced evidence
showing that upon returning to Ottawa the accused fled from the police, and
that they had police scanners in their car.  In addition it led evidence of
concealment, including the acquaintance’s testimony that the accused planned to
get rid of the pistol, and the fact that W attempted to dispose of the pistol
as he ran from the police in Ottawa.  Defence counsel objected to the
submission of this evidence to the jury on the ground that these actions could
be explained by the parole violations and the bank robberies and therefore were
not probative of whether the accused had killed the victim.  The trial judge
allowed the evidence to go to the jury, and gave them an instruction on how it
should be dealt with.  The jury returned verdicts of first degree murder
against both accused.  The Court of Appeal upheld the convictions.

 

Held:  The appeals should be dismissed.

 








In certain circumstances, the conduct of an accused
after a crime has been committed may provide circumstantial evidence of the
accused’s culpability for that crime.  However, it may be proper to instruct a
jury that such evidence has no probative value when, as a result of an
admission by the accused, the evidence cannot logically support an inference of
guilt with respect to the offence being tried rather than some other offence. 
As a general rule, it will be for the jury to decide, on the basis of the
evidence as a whole, whether the post-offence conduct of the accused is related
to the crime before them rather than to some other culpable act.  It is also
within the province of the jury to consider how much weight, if any, such
evidence should be accorded in the final determination of guilt or innocence. 
A “no probative value” instruction will thus be called for only in limited
circumstances.  Such an instruction is most likely to be warranted where the
accused has admitted to committing the actus reus of a criminal act but
has denied a specific level of culpability for that act, or has denied
committing some related offence arising from the same operative set of facts. 
In such circumstances, it can be said that the post-offence conduct of the
accused is “equally explained by” or “equally consistent with” two or more
offences.  By contrast, a “no probative value” instruction is not required where
the accused has denied any involvement in the facts underlying the charge at
issue, and has sought to explain his or her actions by reference to some
unrelated culpable act.  In this case the accused denied any involvement in the
murder, and it was therefore their identities as the killers, and not their
degree of guilt, which formed the issue in dispute at trial.  Since the
evidence of their post-offence conduct was relevant to the question of whether
they had committed the murder, the trial judge was not required to instruct the
jury that it had no probative value.

 

In cases where a “no probative value” instruction is
not required and the post-offence conduct of an accused is put before the jury,
the trial judge should nevertheless provide an instruction regarding the proper
use of that evidence.  In particular, the trial judge should remind the jury
that people sometimes flee or lie for entirely innocent reasons, and that even
if the accused was motivated by a feeling of guilt, that feeling might be attributable
to some culpable act other than the offence for which the accused is being
tried.  The trial judge was not, however, required to direct the jury to apply
the reasonable doubt standard to the evidence of the post-offence conduct,  and
would have been in error had he done so.  The criminal standard of proof
applies only to the jury’s final determination of guilt or innocence and is not
to be applied to individual items or categories of evidence.  Post-offence
conduct, like any evidence, takes on its full significance and probative value
only in the context of the other evidence in the case.  Here, the trial judge
properly instructed the jury that the acts of flight and concealment of the
accused constituted evidence “which may be considered and weighed by you, as
triers of fact, together with all the evidence in deciding the guilt or
innocence of the accused”.  He reminded the jury that flight or concealment
does not necessarily imply guilt, but can arise from any number of innocent
motives.  He further instructed the jury that there might be “very valid
reasons” for the conduct of the accused other than their guilt for the murder,
and reviewed the alternative explanations put forth by the defence.  The jury
charge relating to the evidence of post-offence conduct was therefore adequate
as given.

//Major J.//

 

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

 

1                                  
Major J. -- The
appellants, Richard Gerry White and Yves Rhéal Côté, were convicted of first
degree murder in connection with the execution-style killing of Wei Kueng
Chiu.  Their appeals were dismissed by the Ontario Court of Appeal.  The main
issue in these appeals is whether the trial judge properly instructed the jury
regarding the inferences to be drawn from the conduct of the appellants after
the murder.  In particular, the appeals concern evidence that the appellants
fled from the jurisdiction in which the murder was committed, ran from the
police to avoid arrest, and attempted to dispose of one of the murder weapons. 


 

2                                  
Two questions are before this Court.  The first is whether, pursuant to
the principles set out in R. v. Arcangioli, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 129, the
trial judge should have instructed the jury that the appellants’ post-offence
conduct had “no probative value” with respect to Chiu’s murder.  The second
question is whether the jury should have been instructed to draw no inferences
from that evidence unless they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
the appellants’ conduct was motivated by consciousness of guilt for having
murdered Chiu, and not by some other cause.

 

I.  The
Facts

 








3                                  
On the morning of August 27, 1989, the body of Wei Kueng Chiu was
discovered at an isolated location near Ottawa.  He had been shot twice in the
upper body with a 12-gauge shotgun, and four times in the head with a .22
calibre pistol.  Chiu had last been seen alive at about 8:00 p.m. the previous
evening in the company of the appellants.  The appellants were seen together
later that night, but without Chiu.  The three men were known to be friends,
having served time together at Joyceville Penitentiary.  All three had been
released on parole earlier in the year.    

 

A.  The
Appellants’ Departure from Ottawa

 

4                                  
As stated, the central issue in these appeals concerns the behaviour of
the appellants after Chiu was killed.  The appellants remained in Ottawa on
August 27 but did not return home that night and were not seen again in the
area for nearly two weeks. It is not clear precisely when they left Ottawa, but
on the morning of August 29 they robbed a bank in Mississauga, Ontario, about
500 kilometres away.  One week later, on September 5, they robbed the same
bank.  During these robberies Côté fired a 12-gauge shotgun and a .22 calibre
pistol, and left behind shells and cartridge cases that matched those found at
the scene of Chiu’s murder.  The appellants admitted the facts concerning both
robberies.

 








5                                  
From August 29 until September 7, the appellants stayed at two motels in
Burlington, Ontario.  During that time Côté missed a meeting with his parole
officer in Ottawa, and White failed to respond to a letter regarding a similar
meeting that he had missed earlier in the month.  As a result of these parole
violations, arrest warrants were issued for both appellants.  White also failed
to pick up a $400 social assistance cheque in Ottawa which he knew was available
since August 30.  On August 31, Côté called his landlord in Ottawa and asked
him to gather his “things” and put them aside.  Côté said that someone would
pick them up because he would not be returning.  When the landlord asked why,
Côté replied: “the less you know, the better.”

 

B.  Evidence
of Paul Corner

 

6                                  
Paul Corner testified for the Crown as an accomplice witness.  On the
stand, he admitted that he had a criminal record, including numerous offences
of dishonesty.  Corner testified that he was acquainted with the appellants
from Joyceville Penitentiary, and that he met with them on August 29 in
Burlington and registered them at a motel under his name that night.  According
to Corner, the following events unfolded in the appellants’ motel room.  White
and Côté unpacked their bags and removed a 12-gauge shotgun and a .22 calibre
pistol.  Côté then stated that he had “better see what it is like down in
Ottawa” and placed a telephone call.  At the end of the ensuing conversation,
which Corner could not follow because it was in French, Côté turned to White
and said: “everything is cool, there is no heat”.  White then turned to Corner
and explained that he and Côté had “snuffed somebody” in Ottawa, and more
specifically that they had shot somebody to death with a shotgun and a pistol. 
When Corner expressed concern about his car, which he had lent to White earlier
in the month, White assured him that “the car is fine, we didn’t -- there is no
heat on [the] car”.  Corner further testified that Côté was anxious to “get rid
of the .22” and that White agreed to do so as soon as they could get another
one.  According to Corner, White also said that he and Côté were “going away”
and needed money.  Corner testified that he got the impression from the
appellants that they were planning to go “west”.

 

C.  Flight
from the Police in Ottawa

 








7                                  
White and Côté returned to Ottawa on September 7, 1989.  The following
morning the Ottawa police were tipped off, caught up with the appellants, and
signalled for them to stop their car.  The appellants accelerated and a short
chase ensued.  The appellants drove down a side street, slowed down, leapt from
their car while it was still moving, and began running away.  Some officers
gave chase on foot.  When one of the officers fired a shot in the air, Côté
stopped and was arrested at gunpoint.  White continued to flee, and threw a .22
calibre pistol under a parked car as he ran.  He was arrested a short time
later.  

 

8                                  
In the appellants’ car, the police found a 12-gauge shotgun, ammunition
for the shotgun and for a .22 calibre pistol, radio scanners, and lists of
police frequencies.  Forensic tests revealed that the shotgun was the same
weapon that had been used in Chiu’s murder and during the bank robberies.  The
pistol discarded by White was recovered and was also determined to have been
used in the murder and the robberies.  The Crown introduced evidence
establishing that both the shotgun and the pistol had been in the appellants’
possession before Chiu was killed.    

 

II.  Judicial
History

 

A.  Supreme
Court of Ontario

 








9                                  
At trial, the Crown introduced the appellants’ departure from Ottawa,
their comments to Corner, their flight from the police and White’s attempt to
dispose of the pistol as evidence that the appellants were conscious of their
own guilt for Chiu’s murder and were attempting to escape prosecution for that
crime.  Defence counsel objected to the submission of this evidence to the jury
on the ground that the appellants’ actions could be explained by the parole
violations and the bank robberies and therefore were not probative of whether
the appellants had killed Chiu.  

 

10                              
The trial judge allowed the evidence to go to the jury, and gave the
following instruction:

 

I want to deal briefly with the evidence of flight and concealment. 
And I want to, before I deal with that, I will tell you what the rule is as to
[how] you should look at this evidence.  What the law says is that flight or
concealment of the accused after a crime is committed does not mean that the
accused is guilty of the crime.  It is common knowledge that people who are
entirely innocent sometimes fly from the scene of a crime to avoid apprehension
as guilty parties or because they don’t want to get involved as witnesses.  But
flight is a circumstance which may be considered and weighed by you, as triers
of fact, together with all the evidence in deciding the guilt or innocence of
the accused.  In the circumstance of this case where the evidence of flight is
uncontradicted, you may infer that evidence of flight or concealment shows a
consciousness of guilt.  You have first to decide whether the evidence is
evidence of flight or concealment, before you may draw that inference of
consciousness of guilt.

 

.
. .

 

Now [defence counsel] in their closing submissions
told you that there were very valid reasons why the accused were fleeing.  They
were both parole violators and I suppose that is why they went to Hamilton and
to Burlington.  After the robberies in Burlington they came back to Ottawa. 
They wanted to get away from the scene of the robberies.  And they both pointed
out that in any case they started out in Ottawa and they returned to Ottawa so
there is no flight.  These are areas of the evidence on the issue of flight
that you might want to consider and decide whether to draw an inference of
consciousness of guilt or guilt itself.

 

The trial
judge did not discuss the standard of proof that the jury should apply when
considering the evidence of flight and concealment.  The jury returned verdicts
of first degree murder against both appellants. 

 

B.  Ontario
Court of Appeal (1996), 108 C.C.C. (3d) 1

 








11                              
On appeal of their convictions, the appellants raised numerous 
arguments attacking the trial judge’s jury instructions.  The appeals were
dismissed in a per curiam decision by a five-judge panel of the Ontario
Court of Appeal.  Because the reasons of the Court of Appeal dealt with many of
the issues raised in these appeals, they bear examination here.

 

12                              
With respect to consciousness of guilt, the appellants’ arguments before
the Court of Appeal were essentially the same as those made to this Court. 
Relying on Arcangioli, the appellants contended that their conduct after
the murder was fully explained by the parole violations and the bank robberies,
and therefore had no probative value with respect to whether they had also
killed Chiu.  They argued that the trial judge erred by failing to instruct the
jury to disregard that evidence.  The Court of Appeal disagreed.  It stated at
pp. 16-17: 

 

This case is different from Arcangioli.  In Arcangioli
the accused admitted an assault and the issue at trial was his level of
culpability.  On that issue the evidence of consciousness of guilt -- the
accused’s flight from the scene -- had no probative value.  The evidence of
flight was not reasonably capable of supporting the inference that the accused
had committed aggravated assault as opposed to common assault.  In this case
the consciousness of guilt evidence was not led to help the jury determine the
appellants’ level of culpability -- first or second degree murder -- for an
admitted killing. The evidence was led to help the jury determine whether the
appellants were guilty of a killing that they denied having committed.  The
evidence could have probative value on that issue because it could reasonably
support the inference that the appellants’ conduct related to their culpability
for killing Chiu rather than to their culpability for the bank robberies or
parole violations.

 








After
reviewing the conduct at issue in this case, the court concluded that the
evidence was not equally consistent with the alternative explanation advanced
by the appellants.  The court noted that it was the role of the jury, not the
judge, to weigh the evidence and to determine whether in fact it pertained to
the murder rather than to some other criminal activity.  Accordingly, the court
held that the trial judge was not required to instruct the jury that the
evidence had no probative value.   

 

13                              
       The court next considered the argument that the trial judge had
erred by failing to instruct the jury to apply a separate standard of proof to
the evidence relating to consciousness of guilt.  Relying on R. v. Court
(1995), 99 C.C.C. (3d) 237 (Ont. C.A.), the appellants argued that the jury
should have been directed to examine the evidence of post-offence conduct
separately from the rest of the evidence, and to determine beyond a reasonable
doubt whether that conduct reflected a consciousness of guilt on the part of
the appellants for the murder of Chiu; if such a link could not be established,
the jury should have been told that they could draw no inference of guilt from the
appellants’ conduct.     

 

14                              
The court rejected that approach.  It emphasized that the jury’s
determination of guilt or innocence must be based on all of the evidence, and
that the criminal standard cannot be applied to selected items or categories of
evidence separately without violating the principles laid down by this Court in
R. v. Morin, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 345.  As the court explained at p. 26:

 

. . . evidence tending to show consciousness of guilt can properly be
treated as supportive of other evidence of guilt and should not be excluded
from consideration because, on its own, it may not satisfy the standard of
proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

 

. . . as with other evidence, the instructions should not encourage
isolation, lest evidence which fails to meet the reasonable doubt standard, but
is otherwise probative, be set aside in a piecemeal analysis.

 








The Ontario
Court of Appeal acknowledged that it was overruling its own decision in Court
and was disagreeing with the judgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal
in R. v. Poirier (1995), 56 B.C.A.C. 131, but it held that those
decisions could not be reconciled with Morin.  The court stressed the
similarities between evidence relating to consciousness of guilt and other
forms of circumstantial evidence, and noted that segregating one type of
evidence for special treatment would make jury instructions more complex and
confusing.  It concluded that the trial judge did not err by failing to apply
the principles of Court in the jury charge.

 

15                              
The court then disposed of the remaining grounds in the appeals.  First,
it rejected the appellants’ claim that the jury charge was insufficient with
regard to the law of aiding and abetting, and noted at pp. 30-31 that “[o]nce
the jury were satisfied that both accused persons were at the scene of the
crime, there was no room to argue for a lesser or greater involvement between
them.”  The court also rejected the claim that the jury charge was insufficient
with regard to the lack of evidence of motive.  The court found that the charge
on that matter was in fact more favourable to the appellants than the evidence
merited.  

 








16                              
The court next addressed the argument that the trial judge had failed to
provide an adequate warning, pursuant to Vetrovec v. The Queen, [1982] 1
S.C.R. 811, about the reliability of Paul Corner’s testimony.  In particular,
the appellants asserted that the jury should have been told to rely on Corner’s
testimony only to the extent it was supported by independent evidence.  The
court rejected that argument, and held that the charge as given made it
sufficiently clear to the jury that they should regard Corner’s evidence with
great caution.  The court also dismissed the appellants’ argument that the
trial judge had erred by equating “planning and deliberation” with “intention”
and by referring to irrelevant evidence while instructing the jury on those
concepts.  The court agreed that the charge in this area lacked focus, but
concluded that the instructions as a whole clarified the distinction between
deliberation and intention and did not give rise to any reversible error.

 

17                              
The appellants’ remaining arguments concerned the jury charge on
reasonable doubt, the use of evidence of prior convictions, and the overall
reasonableness of the jury’s verdict.  The Court of Appeal dismissed those
arguments in summary fashion.  

 

III.  Issues

 

18                              
Our consideration of these appeals is limited to the two issues
involving post-offence conduct and consciousness of guilt:

 

(1)               Did the Court of Appeal err in
finding that the trial judge was not required to give a “no probative value”
instruction pursuant to Arcangioli?

 

(2)               Did the Court of Appeal err in
finding that a separate standard of proof does not apply to the jury’s
consideration of evidence relating to consciousness of guilt?

 

IV.  Analysis

 

A. 
Post-Offence Conduct and Consciousness of Guilt

                    








19                              
Under certain circumstances, the conduct of an accused after a crime has
been committed may provide circumstantial evidence of the accused’s culpability
for that crime.  For example, an inference of guilt may be drawn from the fact
that the accused fled from the scene of the crime or the jurisdiction in which
it was committed, attempted to resist arrest, or failed to appear at trial. 
Such an inference may also arise from acts of concealment, for instance where
the accused has lied, assumed a false name, changed his or her appearance, or
attempted to hide or dispose of incriminating evidence.  As Weiler J.A. noted
in R. v. Peavoy (1997), 117 C.C.C. (3d) 226 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 238:

 

Evidence of after-the-fact conduct is commonly
admitted to show that an accused person has acted in a manner which, based on
human experience and logic, is consistent with the conduct of a guilty person
and inconsistent with the conduct of an innocent person.  

                    

 

20                              
Evidence of this kind is often called “consciousness of guilt evidence”,
since it is introduced to show that the accused was aware of having committed
the crime in question and acted for the purpose of evading detection and
prosecution.  That label is somewhat misleading and its use should be discouraged. 
“Consciousness of guilt” is simply one inference that may be drawn from the
evidence of the accused’s conduct; it is not a special category of evidence in
itself.  Moreover, the words “consciousness of guilt” suggest a conclusion
about the conduct in question which undermines the presumption of innocence and
may prejudice the accused in the eyes of the jury.  As has been suggested by
the Ontario Court of Appeal, to the extent a general description is necessary,
the use of more neutral language such as “evidence of post-offence conduct” or
“evidence of after-the-fact conduct” is preferable:  Peavoy, supra,
at p. 238.  Regardless of which phrase is used, however, the focus of the jury
should be kept on the specific items of evidence at hand -- the act of flight,
the false statement, as the case may be -- and on the relevance of those items
to the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence. 

 








21                              
Evidence of post-offence conduct is not fundamentally different from
other kinds of circumstantial evidence.  In some cases it may be highly
incriminating, while in others it might play only a minor corroborative role. 
Like any piece of circumstantial evidence, an act of flight or concealment may
be subject to competing interpretations and must be weighed by the jury, in
light of all the evidence, to determine whether it is consistent with guilt and
inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. 

 

22                              
It has been recognized, however, that when evidence of post-offence
conduct is  introduced to support an inference of consciousness of guilt it is
highly ambiguous and susceptible to jury error.  As this Court observed in Arcangioli,
the danger exists that a jury may fail to take account of alternative
explanations for the accused’s behaviour, and may mistakenly leap from such
evidence to a conclusion of guilt.  In particular, a jury might impute a guilty
conscience to an accused who has fled or lied for an entirely innocent reason,
such as panic, embarrassment or fear of false accusation.  Alternatively, the jury
might determine that the conduct of the accused arose from a feeling of guilt,
but might fail to consider whether that guilt relates specifically to the crime
at issue, rather than to some other culpable act. 

 

23                              
Two legal doctrines have arisen in response to these concerns.  As a
preliminary matter, this Court held in Arcangioli that a jury should not
be permitted to consider evidence of post-offence conduct when the accused has
admitted culpability for another offence and the evidence cannot logically support
an inference of guilt with respect to one crime rather than the other.  That
rule is essentially a matter of relevance and will usually apply in narrow
circumstances.  More generally, this Court has also held that when evidence of
post-offence conduct is put to the jury, the jury should be “properly
instructed” to ensure that the evidence is not misused: Arcangioli, at
p. 143; Gudmondson v. The King (1933), 60 C.C.C. 332 (S.C.C.), at pp.
332-33.  The content of such an instruction, particularly the appropriate
standard of proof, has been the subject of ongoing controversy in the Courts of
Appeal and is addressed below.    








 

B.  When
Does Evidence of Post-Offence Conduct Have No Probative Value?        

24                              
In Arcangioli, this Court considered the risks associated with
the use of evidence going to consciousness of guilt.  The facts were
straightforward: the accused was charged with aggravated assault in connection
with a stabbing that occurred during a fight outside a bar.  The fight involved
several people, all of whom fled the scene when it became apparent that the
victim had been stabbed.  At trial, the accused admitted punching the victim,
but denied any involvement in the stabbing; he testified that he fled after he
saw another person stab the victim in the back.  The trial judge instructed the
jury that the accused’s flight was a factor they could consider in reaching
their verdict but that the evidence was not conclusive, as innocent people
sometimes flee.  On appeal to this Court, the jury instruction was held to be
insufficient.  The Court noted at p. 147: 

 

By his own admission, the appellant was not entirely innocent; he
admitted that he had punched [the victim].  The trial judge should have
instructed the jury that the appellant’s flight was equally consistent with
common assault and with aggravated assault, and therefore was incapable of
supporting an inference of consciousness of guilt with respect to the latter. 
Because she did not charge the jury in those terms, there is a danger that the jury
may have wrongly inferred from the evidence that the appellant fled because of
his guilt in stabbing [the victim].

 

As a general
proposition, it was held at p. 145 that:

 

[W]here an accused's conduct may be equally explained by reference to
consciousness of guilt of two or more offences, and where an accused has
admitted culpability in respect of one or more of these offences, a trial judge
should instruct a jury that such evidence has no probative value with respect
to any particular offence. 

 

 








25                              
In this case, which predates Arcangioli, the trial judge did not
give a “no probative value” instruction with regard to the appellants’
post-offence conduct.  The appellants contend that this was error.  They argue
that their acts of flight and concealment could not be probative of
consciousness of guilt with respect to Chiu’s murder, because those acts were
“equally explained” by reference to the parole violations and bank robberies
which they admitted committing.  The issue before this Court is to what extent Arcangioli
governs this case. 

 

Application of Arcangioli

 

26                              
Arcangioli stands for the proposition that a piece of evidence
should not be put to the jury unless it is relevant to the determination of a
live issue in the case.  The conduct of the accused in Arcangioli --
running from the scene of the crime -- was withdrawn from the jury because it
could not reasonably assist them in deciding the specific issue before them. 
As this Court noted at p. 146:

 

[T]he issue was whether the appellant’s flight indicated a
consciousness of guilt arising from the fact that he had stabbed [the victim]
or rather from the fact that he had punched [him].  And on that question,
the evidence could have no probative value. [Emphasis added.]

 

 








Whether a jury
should be permitted to consider evidence of post-offence conduct will depend on
the facts of each case.  The question that should be asked at the outset is:
What does the Crown seek to prove by means of the evidence?  An admission by
the accused may have the effect of narrowing the issue in dispute considerably,
as was the case in Arcangioli.  If, as a result of such an admission,
the accused’s conduct can no longer be attributed to the offence being tried
rather than some other offence, then the jury should be so instructed.  The
evidence of post-offence conduct may still be used by the jury for other
purposes where appropriate, for example to connect the accused to the scene of
the crime or to a piece of physical evidence, or to undermine the credibility
of the accused generally.

 

27                              
As a general rule, it will be for the jury to decide, on the basis of
the evidence as a whole, whether the post-offence conduct of the accused is
related to the crime before them rather than to some other culpable act.  It is
also within the province of the jury to consider how much weight, if any, such evidence
should be accorded in the final determination of guilt or innocence.  For the
trial judge to interfere in that process will in most cases constitute a
usurpation of the jury’s exclusive fact-finding role.  Consequently, a “no
probative value” instruction like the one required in Arcangioli will be
called for only in limited circumstances.

 

28                              
Such an instruction is most likely to be warranted where, as in Arcangioli
itself, the accused has admitted to committing the actus reus of a
criminal act but has denied a specific level of culpability for that act, or
has denied committing some related offence arising from the same operative set
of facts.  In such cases, the participation of the accused in the culpable
event is not at issue; the question to be decided is merely the extent or legal
significance of that participation.  In R. v. Marinaro, [1996] 1 S.C.R.
462, rev’g (1994), 95 C.C.C. (3d) 74 (Ont. C.A.), this Court adopted the
dissenting reasons of Dubin C.J.O., who held at p. 81 of the judgment below:

 

If, at the trial, the appellant had persisted in
his earlier denial of non-involvement in the killing of the deceased, the jury
would have been entitled -- from the evidence of the appellant’s flight from
the scene, the appellant’s false statements, and the destruction of evidence --
to draw an inference of consciousness of guilt from which a further inference
of culpability in the crime could also have been drawn.  Once the appellant had
admitted at trial that he had caused the death of the deceased, however, such
evidence had very limited application.  It had no application in determining
whether the offence committed by the appellant was either murder or
manslaughter.








 

 

See also R.
v. Jacquard, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 314, at pp. 342-44.  Under such circumstances,
it can be said that the post-offence conduct of the accused is “equally
explained by” or “equally consistent with” two or more offences. 

 

29                              
By contrast, a “no probative value” instruction is not required where
the accused has denied any involvement in the facts underlying the charge at
issue, and has sought to explain his or her actions by reference to some
unrelated culpable act.  In such cases it is the identity of the accused as the
perpetrator, rather than the extent of his or her culpability, that is in
issue, and it will almost invariably fall to the jury to decide whether the
evidence of post-offence conduct can be attributed to one culpable act rather
than another.  

 

30                              
In United States v. Myers, 550 F.2d 1036 (5th Cir. 1977), it was
held that the flight of an accused from law enforcement officers could not
reasonably support an inference of consciousness of guilt with respect to a
bank robbery, because the accused had confessed to committing a more recent robbery
in another state.  The reasoning in Myers provided helpful guidance to
this Court in Arcangioli, but its result was not determinative. 
Subsequent American decisions have confined Myers to its facts, and have
confirmed that so long as evidence of after-the-fact conduct is relevant to an
issue in dispute, the attribution of that conduct to one offence rather than
another is normally a question of fact for the jury.  See United States v.
Boyle, 675 F.2d 430  (1st Cir. 1982), at p. 432; United States v. Kalish,
690 F.2d 1144 (5th Cir. 1982),  at p. 1156.

 








31                              
This principle is illustrated by the decision of Doherty J.A. for the
Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Wiltse (1994), 19 O.R. (3d) 379.  In
that case, the two accused, Wiltse and Yarema, were charged with first degree
murder.  Each had provided the police with a false alibi and the Crown sought
to use this lie as evidence going to consciousness of guilt.  At trial, Wiltse
admitted culpability for manslaughter but denied committing murder.  Yarema,
however, denied any responsibility for the killing.  The Ontario Court of
Appeal, applying Arcangioli, held that Wiltse’s false alibi had no
probative value with respect to the question of whether he was guilty of murder
rather than manslaughter.  With regard to Yarema, however, the situation was
different.  The Court noted that Yarema’s false alibi was properly submitted to
the jury to determine whether it reflected Yarema’s participation in the
homicide, which he denied, or in other illegal conduct, which he admitted.  

 

32                              
This distinction provides some guidance as to when a “no probative
value” instruction will be warranted, but it is not a formula.  The result will
always turn on the nature of the evidence in question and its relevance to the
real issue in dispute.  It is possible to imagine cases in which evidence of
post-offence conduct could logically support a distinction between two levels
of culpability for a single act, or between two offences arising from the same
set of facts.  By way of illustration, where the extent of the accused’s flight
or concealment is out of all proportion to the level of culpability admitted,
it might be found to be more consistent with the offence charged.  Post-offence
conduct might also be relevant in cases where the accused has admitted to
committing a physical act but asserts that the act was justified in some way;
in those circumstances, an act of flight or concealment might constitute some
evidence from which, along with other evidence, the jury could infer that the
accused was conscious that he or she had committed a culpable act and
had not, for example, acted in self-defence.  See Peavoy, supra,
at p. 241; Jacquard, supra, at p. 348.    

 








33                              
It bears emphasizing that in these sorts of cases, while the evidence
cannot be said to be irrelevant to the issue in dispute, it might still be
withdrawn from the jury by the trial judge on the basis that it is more
prejudicial than probative.  The same would be true in cases where two separate
offences have been committed and the evidence of post-offence conduct provides
scant basis for distinguishing between them.  Such a decision would fall within
the ordinary discretion of the trial judge, however, and would not be mandated
by the result in Arcangioli.   

 

The Present Appeals

 

34                              
In the present appeals, White and Côté denied any involvement in the
murder for which they were charged.  It was therefore their identities as the
killers, and not their degree of guilt, which formed the issue in dispute at
trial.  With regard to that issue, the Crown introduced evidence of the
appellants’ departure from Ottawa shortly after the murder, along with other
evidence indicating that that departure constituted flight from the area: i.e.,
the fact that the appellants remained away for more than ten days, missed
parole meetings and failed to pick up a social assistance cheque; Côté’s calls
to inquire about “heat” in Ottawa and to instruct his landlord to pack up his
belongings; White’s comments to Corner that he needed a car and money to go
away; and the appellants’ commission of the two bank robberies.  The Crown also
introduced the appellants’ flight from the police in Ottawa, and the fact that
they had police scanners in their car.  In addition, the Crown led evidence of
concealment, including Corner’s testimony that the appellants planned to get
rid of the .22 calibre pistol, and White’s attempt to dispose of that gun as he
ran from the police in Ottawa.

 








35                              
As the Court of Appeal concluded, the foregoing evidence was
relevant to the question of whether White and Côté had committed Chiu’s
murder.  The appellants’ admissions with respect to the parole violations and
bank robberies did not alter that result.   Accordingly, the trial judge was
not required to instruct the jury that the evidence of the appellants’
post-offence conduct had “no probative value” in this case.

 

C. 
Standard of Proof for Evidence of Post-Offence Conduct           

 

36                              
In cases where a “no probative value” instruction is not required and
the post-offence conduct of an accused is put before the jury, the trial judge
should nevertheless provide an instruction regarding the proper use of that
evidence.  The purpose of such a charge is to counter the jury’s natural
tendency to leap from evidence of flight or concealment to a conclusion of
guilt, and to ensure that alternative explanations for the accused’s conduct
are given full consideration.  In particular, the trial judge should remind the
jury that people sometimes flee or lie for entirely innocent reasons, and that
even if the accused was motivated by a feeling of guilt, that feeling might be
attributable to some culpable act other than the offence for which the accused
is being tried.  The jury should be instructed to keep these principles in mind
when deciding how much weight, if any, to give such evidence in the final
evaluation of guilt or innocence.   

 

37                              
The jury charge in this case complied with those requirements, and the
appellants do not claim that there was anything misleading about that charge so
far as it went.  It is contended, however, that the charge was insufficient
because the trial judge did not specifically direct the jury to apply the
criminal standard of proof to the evidence of the appellants’ post-offence
conduct.  

 








38                              
It is the appellants’ submission that the jury should have been told
that unless they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellants’
post-offence conduct constituted flight or concealment, and moreover that those
acts were motivated by the appellants’ sense of culpability for Chiu’s murder
and not by some other explanation, the jury could draw no inference of guilt
from the conduct, and must set it aside and proceed to consider the balance of
evidence in the case.  This kind of instruction has persisted as the subject of
debate in the provincial Courts of Appeal and in other common-law
jurisdictions.  See R. v. Burdick (1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 497 (Ont.
C.A.); R. v. Cole (1980), 53 C.C.C. (2d) 269 (Ont. C.A.); R. v.
Parrington (1985), 20 C.C.C. (3d) 184 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Smith
(1993), 31 B.C.A.C. 189; R. v. Richens, [1993] 4 All E.R. 877 (C.A.)
(calling for such a charge); R. v. McNamara (No. 1) (1981), 56 C.C.C.
(2d) 193 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Bouvier (1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 257 (Ont.
C.A.), aff’d [1985] 2 S.C.R. 485; R. v. Minhas (1986), 29 C.C.C. (3d)
193 (Ont. C.A.) (rejecting or casting doubt on the charge).  Most recently, the
British Columbia Court of Appeal approved of such a charge in Poirier, supra,
and the Ontario Court of Appeal followed suit in Court, supra.  

39                              
In the case at bar, the Court of Appeal overruled its prior decision in Court
and upheld the validity of the instruction given by the trial judge.  I agree
with that conclusion and would dismiss that ground of appeal.  It is settled
that the criminal standard of proof applies only to the jury’s final
determination of guilt or innocence and is not to be applied to individual items
or categories of evidence: Stewart v. The Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 748, at
pp. 759-61; Morin, supra, at p. 354.  It is improper for the jury
to divide their deliberations into separate stages; their verdict must be based
on the record as a whole, not merely on items of evidence which have previously
been established beyond a reasonable doubt: Morin, at p. 360.  The kind
of charge argued for by the appellants is facially inconsistent with these
principles, and no persuasive reason has been advanced which would justify
creating an exception for evidence of post-offence conduct.  The trial judge in
this case was not required to give such a charge and indeed he would have been
in error had he done so. 








 

40                              
The basic principles governing this case were stated by Sopinka J. for a
majority of this Court in Morin, supra.  At issue in Morin was
a jury charge concerning three types of evidence: hairs and fibres found in the
accused’s car, comments by the accused to an undercover officer named Hobbs,
and a confession to a cell-mate.  Of particular relevance here were the
comments to Hobbs, which included the statement “I . . . red rum the innocent”
as well as the accused’s remark that he had a “monk’s mind” in which he could
confine his thoughts in separate compartments.  At trial, the Crown contended
that these somewhat obscure comments to Hobbs, along with the other tendered
items, constituted circumstantial evidence of guilt.  The accused testified and
sought to place an innocent interpretation on his statements.  The trial
judge’s charge with respect to this evidence is set out by Sopinka J. at p. 355
of his reasons, beginning with the following general instruction:

 

You are not obliged to accept any part of the
evidence of a witness just because there is no denial of it.  If you have a
reasonable doubt about any of the evidence you will give the benefit of that
doubt to the accused with respect to such evidence.  Having decided what
evidence you consider worthy of belief, you will consider it as a whole, of
course, in arriving at your verdict.  [Emphasis added by Sopinka J.]

 

 

The trial
judge in Morin then turned to each category of evidence individually. 
He instructed the jury that the evidence of hairs and fibres had only limited
probative value and did not constitute proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  With
respect to the accused’s statements to Hobbs, the judge said:

 

[I]f you find that the evidence of the accused at trial here represents
the correct interpretation of those tapes and transcripts, or parts of the
tapes and transcripts, or if you have a reasonable doubt that that might be so,
you will give him the benefit of the doubt as to those parts of the tapes or
transcripts and adopt his interpretation.

 








 

An essentially
identical charge was given with respect to the evidence of the accused’s
statements to his cell-mate.  

 

41                              
Sopinka J. found, at p. 358, that the foregoing instructions were
erroneous because they encouraged the jury to isolate certain items of evidence
and to evaluate them piecemeal against the criminal standard of proof:

 

The effect of the misdirections referred to above
may very well have been that the jury examined evidence that was crucial to the
Crown’s case in bits and pieces.  Standing alone or pitted against the evidence
of the accused without the support of other evidence, much of this evidence
might have been discarded as not measuring up to the test.  When the jury came
to consider the Crown’s case as a whole there may not have been very much left
of it.  We cannot know for certain, but this scenario is a very likely one and
the charge therefore constituted a serious misdirection. 

 

 

That error was
compounded in Morin by the fact that the judge’s instructions invited
the jury to adopt a two-stage analysis in their deliberations, i.e., an initial
“fact finding” stage in which items of evidence were to be rejected if not
proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and then a “verdict” stage in which guilt or
innocence was to be determined on the basis of whatever pieces of evidence
remained.  Sopinka J. rejected this approach at pp. 360-61:

 

The argument in favour of a two-stage application
of the criminal standard has superficial appeal in theory but in my respectful
opinion is wrong in principle and unworkable in practice.  In principle it is
wrong because the function of a standard of proof is not the weighing of individual
items of evidence but the determination of ultimate issues.  Furthermore, it
would require the individual member[s] of the jury to rely on the same facts in
order to establish guilt.  The law is clear that the members of the jury can
arrive at their verdict by different routes and need not rely on the same
facts.  Indeed the jurors need not agree on any single fact except the ultimate
conclusion.  [Citations omitted.]

 

.
. .








In practice it is not practical not only because
the jury would have to agree on the same facts but what individual facts
prove.  Individual facts do not necessarily establish guilt but are a link in
the chain of ultimate proof.  It is not possible therefore to require the jury
to find facts proved beyond a reasonable doubt without identifying what it
is that they prove beyond a reasonable doubt.  Since the same fact may give
rise to different inferences tending to establish guilt or innocence, the jury
might discard such facts on the basis that there is doubt as to what they
prove.   [Emphasis in original.]

 

...

While the charge may and often does include many helpful tips on the
weighing of evidence . . ., the law lays down only one basic requirement: during
the process of deliberation the jury or other trier of fact must consider the
evidence as a whole and determine whether guilt is established by the
prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt. 

 

 

After
considering the effect of the trial judge’s errors, Sopinka J. concluded at p.
375 that because the jury may have been led to subject individual items of
evidence to the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, “the whole process
of decision was distorted and there has not been a proper trial of the appellant”. 
Accordingly, the appeal was dismissed.

 

Application to the Case at Bar

 








42                              
The decision in Morin is not on all fours with the present
appeals since it dealt with admissions and inculpatory statements, which do not
necessarily present the same risk of jury error as the more ambiguous evidence
of post-offence conduct.  Nevertheless, the items of evidence at issue in Morin
-- particularly the accused’s comments to Hobbs -- are analogous to the
evidence of flight and concealment in these appeals, and the general principles
enunciated in Morin are equally applicable here.  The inherent
difficulty involved in distinguishing between different types of circumstantial
evidence only reinforces the holding in Morin that jury deliberations
are somewhat holistic in nature and should not be broken down in relation to
individual pieces or categories of evidence. 

 

43                              
The instruction argued for by the appellants in this case would require
a jury to evaluate individual items of evidence at the outset of their
deliberations, and to exclude those items from further consideration unless
they are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the Crown’s interpretation of
that evidence is correct.  It would require the jury to give the benefit of the
doubt to the defence on every item of after-the-fact evidence.  That is
precisely the kind of approach that was rejected by Sopinka J. in Morin.  Post-offence
conduct, like any evidence, takes on its full significance and probative value
only in the context of the other evidence in the case.  Evaluated in a
piecemeal fashion, the evidence of post-offence conduct may not allow a jury to
conclude beyond a reasonable doubt what the motivation of the accused was for
his or her actions.  However, in conjunction with all the other evidence in the
case, it may indeed assist the jury in determining whether a reasonable doubt
exists with respect to guilt or innocence.  If such evidence is rejected at the
outset of deliberations, the cumulative effect of the record will be lost, and
the accuracy of the verdict may be compromised.  

 








44                              
This principle was illustrated in Bouvier, supra, in which
the Ontario Court of Appeal considered a jury charge relating to identification
evidence.  The trial judge in that case had instructed the jury that they must
be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the visual identification of the
accused by the complainant and a second witness had been accurate.  Martin
J.A., writing for the court, noted that the record contained other important
pieces of circumstantial evidence -- in particular the fact that a car bearing
the accused’s licence number had been seen near the scene of the crime -- and
he concluded that the trial judge’s instruction may have encouraged the jury to
consider each of those items separately rather than in a cumulative manner. He
stated at p. 272:

  

The jury might not be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt on either the
visual identification or the licence number standing alone, but viewed
together, the one in relation to the other, those pieces of evidence might
satisfy them beyond a reasonable doubt that the respondent was the assailant.

  

 

45                              
Similarly, the case against White and Côté consisted of several types of
circumstantial evidence other than the evidence of post-offence conduct.  The
Crown introduced evidence seeking to establish: 

 

(1)               that the two guns used to kill
Chiu were in the possession of the appellants both before and after the
murder;  

 

(2)               that the appellants admitted to
Corner that they had “snuffed” somebody in Ottawa and in particular that they
had shot somebody to death with a shotgun and a pistol; and

 

(3)               that the appellants had the
opportunity to kill Chiu, who was last seen alive with them just hours before
they were seen at a party without him.

 

 








The meaning of
each of these areas of evidence was necessarily shaped by the others.  In
particular, the appellants’ statements to Corner might well have made it easier
for the jury to conclude that the appellants’ flight from Ottawa and from the
police was motivated by their involvement in the murder of Chiu rather than by
some other explanation.  Equally, the evidence of the appellants’ flight and
concealment may have been used by the jury to corroborate the appellants’
statements to Corner and to support the drawing of an incriminating inference
from the other circumstantial evidence in the case.  As in Morin and Bouvier,
each item of evidence in this case, taken individually, constituted only part
of the picture.  It was only when viewed together that the evidence could
reliably support a conclusion of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.      

 

46                              
The appellants concede that as a general rule the criminal standard of
proof does not apply to individual pieces of evidence.  They contend, however,
that because post-offence conduct can give rise to an inference that is tantamount
to a finding of guilt itself, such conduct is unlike other kinds of
circumstantial evidence and should benefit from an exception to the rule in Morin. 
Specifically, the appellants assert that an act of flight or concealment is not
probative of guilt unless the jury is satisfied that the act was motivated by
the accused’s awareness of having committed the offence in question; but they
point out that once the jury has drawn such an inference of “guilty
consciousness”, it follows as a matter of logic that the accused must in fact
be guilty, unless he or she was somehow mistaken or delusional about having
committed the crime.  Because of this danger, the appellants contend that the
jury should be required to apply the same standard of proof to its evaluation
of post-offence conduct as it would apply to the ultimate issue of guilt, i.e.,
proof beyond a reasonable doubt.   

 








47                              
That argument is not persuasive.  There is no principled basis for the
claim that evidence of after-the-fact conduct is substantively different from
other kinds of circumstantial evidence, or that it should be accorded special
status during jury deliberations.  Other types of highly incriminating evidence
which present essentially the same kinds of risks do not receive such
treatment.  In particular, a pretrial oral admission of guilt, which, as the
Court of Appeal observed at p. 26, “goes more directly to the ultimate issue
than circumstantial evidence of consciousness of guilt”, is not subject to a
separate reasonable doubt analysis: Stewart, supra, at pp.
759-61; Minhas, supra, at p. 210.  As Weiler J.A. observed in Peavoy,
supra, at p. 237, “[t]here is nothing magical or unique about evidence
of after-the-fact conduct.”  It is simply some evidence which is to be
considered and weighed by the jury, together with the rest of the evidence, in
deciding whether the accused is guilty or innocent.  The fact that such
evidence may by its nature be compelling and inculpatory does not have the
effect of modifying the evidentiary threshold required by criminal law —
namely, that all the evidence, when considered together, must give rise to
proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  

 

48                              
It is true that a jury may regard an act of flight or concealment as an
admission of guilt by conduct, and there is a danger that such evidence could
lead a jury to leap erroneously to a conclusion of guilt.  As explained below,
however, the proper remedy for that danger is not the imposition of a separate
burden of proof, but rather an instruction to the jury to be cautious about
drawing an incriminatory inference from such evidence and a reminder that all
the evidence in the case must be considered.  

 

49                              
As a practical matter, if the trial judge invoked the criminal standard
of proof as a threshold test for using evidence of post-offence conduct, there
would be a risk of confusing the jury and inviting them to short-circuit their
deliberations.  If the jury determined beyond a reasonable doubt that the
accused fled or lied because he or she was aware of having committed the crime
charged, they would be less likely to give full consideration to the rest of
the evidence.  If, on the other hand, the jury failed to determine the
motivation of the accused to such a high standard of proof, they would be
forced to exclude the evidence of post-offence conduct, which might otherwise
be useful in the context of the case as a whole.  In either case, the verdict
is likely to be reached on the basis of less than all the evidence.








 

50                              
The appellants submit, in the alternative, that it is permissible for a
jury to apply the reasonable doubt standard to specific items of evidence
provided they do so in light of the evidence as a whole, rather than in
isolation.  In their view, Morin stands for the limited proposition that
individual items of evidence must not be assessed in a “piecemeal” fashion. 
They submit that  this Court’s decision in R. v. MacKenzie, [1993] 1
S.C.R. 212, “refined” that holding and made clear that the jury may apply the
criminal standard of proof when deciding whether to accept or reject a
particular piece of evidence, as long as they do not lose sight of the larger
evidentiary context in the process. 

 

51                              
 MacKenzie is distinguishable from these appeals and does not
defeat the applicability of Morin.  In MacKenzie, the accused had
made an out of court admission and then sought to place an innocent
interpretation on that statement at trial.  The case therefore dealt with a
conflict between two facially inconsistent pieces of evidence going to the
crucial issue in the case.  The trial judge instructed the jury that they
should consider both the admission and the subsequent testimony of the accused
in light of all the evidence before them; if they accepted the testimony as true,
or if they had a reasonable doubt about it being true, they should reject the
earlier admission relied upon by the Crown.  On appeal, this Court held that
the jury charge was not improper.  La Forest J., for the majority, stated at
pp. 236-37:

 








As a final general comment, it is important to keep
in mind just what MacIntosh J. was striving to achieve in these impugned
passages.  The contradiction between the accused’s out-of-court statement and
his testimony at trial was a key issue in the case, and the trial judge was
entitled, in his review of the evidence, to give hints to the jury on how to
assess such important issues:  see Morin at p. 361.  MacIntosh J.
suggested that the jury focus on the two statements, and pointed out that as a
matter of logic the two could not coexist.  In my view his suggestion that one
of the statements must be “rejected”, couched as it was with the proviso that
all of the other evidence must be taken into account, in no way prejudiced the
Crown.

 

 

 With respect
to Morin, La Forest J. stated at p. 239:

 

I do not view this discretion of a trial judge to
instruct on “rejecting” evidence as some exception to, or modification of this
Court’s disapproval of a two-stage process of evaluating evidence.  Rather, it
is merely a reflection of the reality of jury deliberations -- on important
items of evidence the jury may require guidance on how to approach its task. 
As in this case, where a statement by an accused at trial is entirely at odds
with a previous out-of-court statement by the accused, and the jury believes
the statement at trial, or is left in reasonable doubt that it is true, then
the jury must reject the out-of-court statement; the accused must be given the
benefit of the doubt.  In arriving at that conclusion, the jury should, of
course, give consideration to the evidence as a whole.

 

 

52                              
MacKenzie pointedly does not provide that a jury may sift through
the evidence and reject any item that is not proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 
Unlike Morin, MacKenzie dealt with the credibility of conflicting
statements going directly to the ultimate issue in dispute.  The jury’s
decision to believe or disbelieve the statement relied upon by the Crown
necessarily amounted to choosing between the two competing theories of the
case.  In those limited circumstances, it was held that the trial judge could
instruct the jury not to believe the Crown’s evidence if, in light of the case
as a whole, including the contrary testimony of the accused, they had a
reasonable doubt that the evidence was true.  As La Forest J. noted at p. 240,
quoting Freeman J.A. in the judgment below: 

 

The ordinary meaning of “reject” is to refuse to accept, and on the
whole of the charge there is no reason to conclude the jury would have
understood it in any other sense.  In that light if the jury understood they
were to refuse to accept the statement as proof of the event it described
until they were satisfied of the guilt of the accused on the whole of the
evidence including the statement, I can see no difficulty. [Emphasis
added.]

  

 








This approach
is consistent with the principle, enunciated in prior decisions of this Court,
that where there is a question of credibility between defence and Crown
evidence on a vital issue, the jury should be told to consider the record as a
whole and to give the benefit of the doubt to the accused’s version of events,
rather than simply choosing the more believable of the two accounts: Nadeau
v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 570, at pp. 572-73; Morin, supra,
at p. 362; R. v. W. (D.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742, at pp. 749-50.  Given the
dispositive nature of the evidence in question, there is little risk that such
an instruction would be misleading, since a jury would ultimately have to apply
the criminal standard to the evidence in any event by virtue of the general
instructions regarding the burden of proof.  Therefore, although the
instruction does focus the jury’s attention on two pieces of evidence, in its
effect it is not much different from telling them that if all the evidence in
the case raises a reasonable doubt in their minds about the guilt of the
accused, they must acquit.

 








53                              
It makes no sense to extend the reasoning of MacKenzie to a case
where, as here (and in Morin), the Crown has introduced items of
circumstantial evidence that are subject to different interpretations and are
not individually crucial to the determination of the ultimate issue.  It will
always be error for the trial judge to instruct a jury to apply a reasonable
doubt standard to such evidence, even if the instruction is couched in terms of
the record as a whole.  The facts of this appeal provide an example of how such
a charge can undermine the deliberation process.  The appellants contend that
the jury should have been instructed not to rely on any evidence of post-offence
conduct in this case unless they could first draw the inference -- beyond a
reasonable doubt and on the basis of all the other evidence in the case -- that
such conduct was motivated by the appellants’ awareness that they had killed
Chiu and their desire to escape detection for that crime.  In making that
determination, the jury would have had to weigh not only the evidence of the
bank robberies and parole violations, but also the evidence of the appellants’
opportunity to kill Chiu, their connection to the murder weapons, their
comments to Corner, and any other evidence which might have made it more or
less likely that the appellants had actually committed the murder and, by
extension, that their subsequent actions were motivated by their awareness of
that fact.  Obviously, to draw an inference of consciousness of guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt following such an analysis would be no different from
concluding that the appellants were in fact guilty of murdering Chiu. 

 

54                              
In this sense, the jury charge suggested by the appellants might set the
deliberation process backwards: instead of directing the jury to use the
evidence of post-offence conduct in their determination of guilt or innocence,
it would require them to decide the ultimate issue as a predicate to using the
evidence in the first place.  It would collapse the entire jury deliberation
into an analysis of the significance of a single act of the accused, and would
make all the other evidence in the case merely supportive of that
determination.  Such an instruction would thus have the perverse effect of
transforming any piece of evidence of after-the-fact conduct, no matter how
minor in the scheme of the Crown’s case, into crucial evidence.  

 








55                              
This does not mean that a jury may never be instructed to apply the
reasonable doubt standard to evidence of post-offence conduct.  In the rare
case where evidence of flight or concealment is the only evidence or
constitutes substantially all of the evidence of the Crown, it follows that
such evidence must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt in order to support a
conclusion of guilt, and it would not be error for the trial judge to make this
clear to the jury.  In addition, where evidence of post-offence conduct is so
crucial to the Crown’s case that the final determination of guilt necessarily
turns upon it, and the evidence is subject to two directly conflicting
interpretations, the trial judge would be justified in telling the jury that in
choosing which theory to believe with respect to that evidence, they should
consider the record as a whole and give the benefit of the doubt to the
accused.  As in MacKenzie, however, such a charge would only be proper
if it did not involve any significant departure from the standard of proof that
the jury would properly apply in any event by virtue of the general instruction
on reasonable doubt.  

 

56                              
Much of the confusion in this area of the law stems from the practice of
categorizing evidence of flight or concealment in terms of the conclusion which
the Crown seeks to draw from it, namely that it establishes the “consciousness
of guilt” of the accused.  That inference, going as it does so directly to the
ultimate issue of guilt, is properly to be drawn only at the end of the jury’s
deliberations, once all the evidence has been considered.  Hiving such evidence
off at the outset and subjecting it to a separate reasonable doubt analysis
creates a logical conundrum and raises the very real danger that the jury will
never consider all the evidence together.  That is precisely the concern which
animated this Court’s decision in Morin.  Moreover, if such an approach
were accepted with respect to evidence of post-offence conduct, there is no
reason in principle why it could not also apply to many other kinds of
circumstantial evidence, since the jury must always ask itself whether a
particular piece of such evidence points to guilt rather than to some other
reasonable explanation.

 








57                              
A good deal of the difficulty disappears once the discussion of
“consciousness of guilt” is eliminated from the trial judge’s instruction.  It
is preferable simply, in the spirit of Morin, to leave evidence of
flight or concealment evaluated, but somewhat at large until the final stage of
putting all the evidence together and seeing if it proves the case beyond a
reasonable doubt.  As previously noted, there is a risk that juries might jump
too quickly from evidence of post-offence conduct to an inference of guilt. 
However, the best way for a trial judge to address that danger is simply to make
sure that the jury are aware of any other explanations for the accused’s
actions, and that they know they should reserve their final judgment about the
meaning of the accused’s conduct until all the evidence has been considered in
the normal course of their deliberations.  Beyond such a cautionary
instruction, the members of jury should be left to draw whatever inferences
they choose from the evidence at the end of the day.   

 

58                              
In this case, the trial judge properly instructed the jury that the
appellants’ acts of flight and concealment constituted evidence “which may be
considered and weighed by you as triers of fact, together with all the
evidence, in deciding the guilt or innocence of the accused”.  He reminded the
jury that flight or concealment does not necessarily imply guilt, but can arise
from any number of innocent motives, and he gave examples of such motives.  He
further instructed the jury that there might be “very valid reasons” for the
appellants’ conduct other than their guilt for Chiu’s murder; again, he
reviewed the alternative explanations put forth by the defence, namely the
parole violations and the bank robberies.  The trial judge did make several
references to drawing an “inference of consciousness of guilt”, which, in light
of these reasons, was not ideal; he did not, however, categorize the evidence
in terms of that inference, but rather referred to “the evidence of flight and
concealment”.  On the whole, as the Court of Appeal concluded, the jury charge
relating to the evidence of post-offence conduct was adequate as given.  Had
the trial judge imposed an artificial threshold of reasonable doubt on this
isolated aspect of the jury’s analysis, he would have been in error.  

 

D.  Other
Grounds for Appeal

 








59                              
The remaining grounds for appeal raised by the appellants concern the 
sufficiency of the jury instructions with regard to planning and deliberation,
aiding and abetting,  reasonable doubt, prior convictions, the lack of evidence
of motive, and the reliability of the testimony of Paul Corner.  We have
considered the appellants’ arguments and agree with the Court of Appeal’s
disposition of those issues.

 








V.  Conclusions

 

60                              
There was no need in this case for the trial judge to issue a “no
probative value” instruction pursuant to Arcangioli.  Nor would it have
been correct for the trial judge to instruct the jury to apply the reasonable
doubt standard to its evaluation of the evidence of the appellants’
post-offence conduct.  The trial judge’s instructions were adequate, and the
Court of Appeal did not err in so finding.  These appeals should be dismissed.

The accused was charged with robbing a convenience
store.  The store clerk described the robber to the police and, a few days
later, was shown 12 photographs.  At trial, the clerk stated that he suspected
three of the men shown, one of whom was the accused, but that he could be no
more than 25 to 30 percent sure that any of them was the robber.   He also
stated that, when he was first shown the photographs, the one he suspected the
most was not the accused.  The Crown introduced as evidence the videotape of
the robbery, recorded by the store security camera, and the clerk testified
that it showed all of the robbery.  At the conclusion of the review of the
videotape, the clerk was asked if the man who robbed him was in court, to which
he replied that he did not think so.  A police officer who knew the accused
testified that when he arrested him his facial appearance was different from
that in court.  The Crown closed its case and the defence elected to call no
evidence.  The trial judge directed herself as to the frailties of eyewitness
identification but indicated that the videotape was very clear and that the
robber was in the camera long enough for her to make a careful observation. 
She concluded that the person who committed the robbery on the tape was the
accused and she convicted him. The Court of Appeal quashed the accused’s
conviction as unreasonable and entered an acquittal.  The court found that the
trial judge should not have relied solely on her own comparison between the
appearance of the person on the videotape and the appearance of the accused in
court to reach a conclusion that had no other foundation in the evidence.

 

Held (Sopinka and Major
JJ. dissenting):  The appeal should be allowed.

 








Per Lamer C.J. and La
Forest, L’Heureux‑Dubé, Gonthier, Cory, McLachlin and Iacobucci  JJ.: 
Courts have recognized the importance and usefulness of videotapes  in the
search for truth in criminal trials as this type of evidence can serve to
establish innocence just as surely and effectively as it may establish guilt. 
A video camera records accurately all that it perceives and it is precisely
because videotape evidence can present such very clear and convincing evidence
of identification that triers of fact can use it as the sole basis for the identification
of the accused before them as the perpetrator of the crime.

 

Once it is established that a videotape has not been
altered or changed, and that it depicts the scene of a crime, it becomes
admissible and relevant evidence.  Not only is the tape real evidence, but it
is also, to a certain extent, testimonial evidence as well.  It should be used
by a trier of fact in determining whether a crime has been committed and
whether the accused before the court committed the crime.  The degree of
clarity and quality of the tape, and to a lesser extent the length of time
during which the accused appears on the videotape, will all contribute to
establishing the weight which a trier of fact may properly place upon the
evidence.  The time of depiction may not be significant for even if there are
but a few frames which clearly show the perpetrator that may be sufficient to
identify the accused.

 

Although triers of fact are entitled to reach a
conclusion as to identification based solely on videotape evidence, they must
exercise care in doing so.  When a jury is asked to identify an accused in this
manner, clear directions must be given to them as to how they are to approach
this task.  They should be instructed to consider carefully whether the video
is of sufficient clarity and quality and shows the accused for a sufficient
time to enable them to conclude that identification has been proven beyond a
reasonable doubt.  If it is the only evidence adduced as to identity, the jury
should be reminded of this.  Further, they should be told, once again, of the
important requirement that, in order to convict on the basis of the videotape
alone, they must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that it identifies the
accused.  A trial judge sitting alone must be subject to the same cautions and
directions as a jury in considering videotape evidence of identification.

 








Here,  the trial judge did not err in finding the
accused guilty of  robbery.  The videotape is of excellent quality and depicts
the accused for a significant period of time.  The evidence of  the tape is of
such clarity and strength that it provided convincing evidence upon which the
trial judge could properly base her finding of fact that the accused was the
person shown in the tape.  There was no need for corroboration of this tape.
The fact that the store clerk could not identify the accused is not of great
significance.  The violent and menacing jab made by the robber with a large
knife directed towards the clerk suggests that self‑preservation, not
identification, may very reasonably have been the clerk’s prime concern at the
time of the robbery.

 

Per Sopinka and Major 
JJ. (dissenting):  While  the sensory observations of a trial judge, based on a
review of a videotape and the appearance of the accused, are admissible
evidence of ""identity"" to support a guilty verdict, the evidence in
this case makes it clear that the verdict rendered at trial was
""unreasonable"" within the meaning of s. 686(1) (a)(I) of
the Criminal Code .  The accused was convicted on the basis of very weak
identification evidence, which was undermined by the evidence of the Crown's
only eyewitness.

 








                   The trial judge relied on her own observations of
the videotape to convict the accused.  She made these observations after having
viewed the 30‑second video only once.  She  made no reference to specific
characteristics of the man on the videotape that conformed to the appearance of
the accused and there was no confirmatory evidence supporting her observations
of the video and the accused.  Not only did the trial judge’s observations not
have any support in the evidence but, more importantly, her observations were
contradicted by the evidence of the store clerk ‑‑ the only person
who actually witnessed the crime ‑‑ who, despite his opportunity to
view the accused and the tape in the courtroom, was unable to conclude that the
accused was the man on the video.  There was also evidence that, a few days
after the robbery, the store clerk  identified a person other than the accused
as the more likely perpetrator of the crime.   Further, it is significant that
the trial judge’s observations are entirely untested by cross‑examination
and they cannot be tested on appeal.  In order to evaluate the
reasonableness of the evidence upon which a trier of fact relies, a court of
appeal must be able to examine all the evidence.  All the assurances about the
clarity of the video are of no avail if the court  cannot see the person with
whom the comparison is being made.  The accused’s conviction was thus based on
evidence that amounted to no more than the untested opinion of the trial judge
which was contradicted by other evidence that the trial judge did not reject.  
In the circumstances of this case, it was unreasonable for the trial judge to
convict based on her opinion alone.  In light of the inherent frailties of
identification evidence, the accused’s conviction rests on a shaky foundation
and is unsafe and unsatisfactory.  The verdict cannot be supported by the
evidence.

alone provide the necessary evidence to enable the trier of fact to identify
the accused as the perpetrator of the crime?  That is the question that must be
resolved on this appeal.

 








I.       Factual Background

 

2             
In 1991, during the early morning hours of May 13, Mahmood Wahabzada was
the sole employee in a Mac’s Milk store.  At about 2:00 a.m., a man armed
with a knife entered the store and ordered him to open the cash register. 
Mr. Wahabzada complied.  The robber took some $230 from the register and
fled.  The store clerk described the robber to the police as hefty with a
strong build, blond hair, a mustache and taller than his own height of 175
centimetres.  He could not recall the clothes worn by the robber.  As he
explained at the trial “You know that time is a very panic time.  One cannot
remember everything”.  Two days after the robbery, the store clerk was shown
photos of 12 men.  He suspected three of the men shown, one of whom was the
respondent (accused).  At the trial, he testified that he thought that the man
shown in photograph number 8, who was not the respondent, could be the
robber but he was only 25 to 30 percent sure.  He said that when he was first
shown the photos he could be no more definite than to say that he “mostly”
suspected photograph number 8.

 

3             
The police officers gave evidence that when he was shown the photos the
store clerk exclaimed “that’s him” when looking at photo number 6 (which
was of the respondent) or “He looks just like him” referring to the same photo,
but added “He looks a bit like him also” when referring to photo number 8.

 

4             
The Crown introduced as evidence the videotape of the robbery, recorded
by the store security camera.  The store clerk testified that it showed all of
the robbery.  At the conclusion of the review of the videotape, the clerk was
asked if the man who robbed him was in court, to which he replied that he did
not think so.

 








5             
A detective who had known the respondent for some years was present at
the time of his arrest.  He testified that the respondent then had a sparse
mustache covering the upper part of his lip, which was not present on the day
of the trial.  In cross‑examination, the officer acknowledged that the
respondent had denied committing the robbery and said that he’d been home with
his mother and brother.  The defence did not present any evidence.

 

II.     The Courts Below

 

A.     Judgment at Trial

 

6             
It is necessary in this appeal to set out some of the discussions which
took place between counsel for the defence during his submissions and the trial
judge as well as portions of the reasons.  Counsel for the respondent cautioned
the trial judge of the frailties of eyewitness identification.  In response and
as part of her reasons, the trial judge stated:

 

I have directed my mind, but what about that video tape?  I mean the
video tape does away with a lot of the frailty of identification by a witness
who said to me he was frightened, he was nervous, he couldn’t recall some of
it.  And look at the tape.  The tape doesn’t lie.

 

                                                                   . . .

 

. . . a movie showing the robbery being committed is surely
one of the best forms of evidence you’ve got.  And not only was the movie ‑‑
the man’s face was practically in front of the screen.

 

                                                                   . . .

 

I looked at that video, and I looked at it very
carefully, and I can honestly tell you there is no doubt in my mind that the
man who committed that robbery on that video was your client.

 

                                                                   . . .

 








As I said earlier, I’ve directed myself to all the
frailties of the I.D. cases.  And over my years as counsel, I know I was
involved in a number where it was a serious issue, and I’m well aware of all of
it, and the reason behind the case law.

 

And a lot of the reasons for those frailties are the
very things that exist in this case.  An act of violence, which happens quickly
and unexpectedly to a victim who is terrified.

 

At best he could say that Photograph 6 looked like,
and he also pointed to 8 and to 11.  He said quite bluntly: I was afraid.  I
can’t remember all.  He also doesn’t have English as a first language.

 

Now, I’ve seen video tapes in the past that have
been grainy, where the lighting hasn’t been good, where there’s no clear view
over a period of time of the robbery and of the perpetrator.

 

This particular video tape is very clear.  The
lighting is very good.  The man is in the camera for long enough to make a
careful observation.  And the issue of beyond a reasonable doubt is when I’m
obliged to make a decision, and I cannot ignore what my eyes tell me, and my
eyes tell me, and there’s no dispute this isn’t a video tape of the robbery,
that the person who committed that robbery is Mr. Nikolovski, and I can’t
ignore that. . . .

 

It would be mere speculation for me to say, there’s
one chance in a million he’s got an absolute twin running around, who happened
to rob that store, that’s getting into the realm of speculation at that point.

 

The trial
judge concluded, without calling upon the Crown:

 

. . . I think we’ve beaten this to death. . . . I’m
satisfied that the robbery was committed by your client.  I’m satisfied on
looking at that tape that that’s him and he’s convicted.

 

B.     The Court of Appeal

 

7             
The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, quashed the conviction and
entered the acquittal of the respondent: (1994), 19 O.R. (3d) 676, 73 O.A.C.
258, 92 C.C.C. (3d) 37, 34 C.R. (4th) 98.

 








8             
Arbour J.A., on behalf of a unanimous court, agreed with the trial judge
that the videotape was of very good quality and that the image was sharp and
clear.  She observed as well that there was no doubt that the videotape would
permit a comparison to be made between the robber and the accused appearing
before the trial judge.

 

9             
However, she was doubtful whether a prosecution could be successful
where identification evidence was made solely on the basis of a photograph or
videotape without confirmatory evidence from a witness linking the accused to
the crime.  She observed that no one identified the respondent as the man in
the videotape, except the trial judge.  She expressed the view that the Crown
ought to have called the detective who had known the respondent for some years
to testify as to whether the person on the videotape and the respondent were
one and the same.

 

10         
Thus, the court determined that, although the trial judge was not in
error in reaching her conclusion on the basis of the videotape evidence, it
still remained to be decided whether the conviction was unreasonable.  On this
issue, Arbour J.A. stated (at pp. 690‑91 O.R.):

 

In a case such as this one where the
identification is made exclusively by the trier of fact and has no other
support in the evidence, and operating within the constraints of appellate
review that such a record creates, I can only conclude that the conviction is
unreasonable. . . .

 

The videotape was properly entered as an exhibit at
trial after the witness identified it as depicting accurately the scene of the
robbery, and the trial judge would have been entitled to examine the videotape
to assess the credibility of the identification evidence based on the
videotape, had there been any.  However, in my view the trial judge should
not have relied solely on her own comparison between the appearance of the
person on the videotape and the appearance of the accused in court to reach a
conclusion that had no other foundation in the evidence.  In all the
circumstances, I consider that this amounts to an unsafe verdict.  [Emphasis
added.]

 








11         
Therefore, it appears to be the opinion of the Court of Appeal that
corroboration by a witness that the person shown in the videotape is the
accused is essential and its absence is fatal to the case.

 

III.    Issues to Be
Resolved

 

12         
1.        Can a trier of fact identify the accused before the court as
the perpetrator of the crime on the basis of a viewing of the videotape alone
without any corroborating testimony that the accused is the person depicted in
the tape?

 

2.      On the facts presented in this case, did
the trial judge err in identifying and convicting the accused solely on the
basis of the videotape evidence?

 

IV.    The Purpose of
Evidence Adduced at Criminal Trials

 

13         
The ultimate aim of any trial, criminal or civil, must be to seek and to
ascertain the truth.  In a criminal trial the search for truth is undertaken to
determine whether the accused before the court is, beyond a reasonable doubt,
guilty of the crime with which he is charged.  The evidence adduced must be
relevant and admissible.  That is to say, it must be logically probative and
legally receivable.  The evidence may be that of eyewitnesses, or it may be
circumstantial, including the production of physical evidence which is often
termed “real evidence”.  In every criminal case, if there is to be conviction,
the evidence must be sufficiently convincing that the trier of fact is
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.

 








14         
With the progress of scientific studies and advances in technology,
evidence put forward particularly as to identification has changed over the
years.  The admission of new types of evidence is often resisted at first and
yet, later accepted as commonplace and essential to the task of truth finding. 
Fingerprint evidence may be the first example of scientific evidence leading to
identification.  Similarly, blood typing with its ever increasing refinements
can be extremely helpful in identification.  DNA testing is yet another
example.  It must never be forgotten that evidence of this type can serve to
establish innocence just as surely and effectively as it may establish guilt. 
The case of Guy‑Paul Morin serves as a constant reminder of this.

 

V.     The Evolution of
the Use of Audio Tapes, Photographs and Videotapes as Evidence in Canada

 

15         
It may be helpful to consider the evolution of the use of audio and
video tape evidence in Canada.  In R. v. Pleich (1980), 55 C.C.C. (2d)
13, at p. 32, the Court of Appeal for Ontario recognized that tape
recordings are real evidence that had, as well, many of the characteristics of
testimonial evidence.  In R. v. Rowbotham (1988), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 1, the
use of audio tapes was considered by the same court.  It found that it was the
tapes themselves that constituted the evidence which should be considered by
the jury.  It emphasized that the tapes could provide cogent and convincing
evidence of culpability or equally powerful and convincing evidence of
innocence.  It stressed that the members of the jury must have equipment
available to them so that they could themselves listen to the tapes and reach
their decision as to the weight that should be given to them.  It was expressed
in this way (at pp. 47‑48 and 49):

 

It is true that the tapes themselves constitute
the evidence which should be and must be considered by the jury.  It is the
tapes which will demonstrate not simply the words spoken by an accused or co‑conspirator,
but also the emphasis given to particular words and phrases and the tone of
voice employed by the participants during the intercepted conversations.  Upon
hearing the tape, the jocular exclamation will be readily distinguishable from
the menacing threat of violence.  The tapes may provide cogent and convincing evidence
of culpability or equally powerful and convincing evidence of innocence.








                                                                   . . .

 

As well the necessary equipment must be made available so that
the jury may listen to the tapes themselves.  [Emphasis added.]

 

16         
I agree with the reasoning and conclusion on this issue set out in Pleich
and Rowbotham.  A tape, particularly if it is not challenged as to its
accuracy or continuity, can provide the most cogent evidence not only of the
actual words used but in the manner in which they were spoken.  A tape will
very often have a better and more accurate recollection of the words used and
the manner in which they were spoken than a witness who was a party to the
conversation or overheard the words. As a result of Rowbotham, the trier
of fact in Ontario was very properly authorized to use his or her own senses in
determining the weight that should be accorded to the evidence of an audio
tape.  There is no reason why this same reasoning should not be applied to
videotapes.

 

17         
The admission of videotapes as evidence seems to be a natural
progression from audio tapes.  In R. v. B. (K.G.), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 740,
at pp. 768 and 774, this Court praised the evidence obtained from
videotapes as a “milestone” contributing to the “triumph of a principled
analysis over a set of ossified judicially created categories”.  In R. v.
Leaney, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 393, the main identification evidence against the
accused was a videotape of the crime in progress and the testimony of five
police officers.  Although this Court held that the evidence of four of the
police officers ought to have been excluded, it upheld the conviction of Leaney
on the basis of the trial judge’s own observations of the videotape and his
comparison of the tape to the accused in the box.  At page 415,
McLachlin J., for the majority, stated:

 








Given the trial judge’s clear statement that he
arrived at his conclusion as to identity independently of the evidence of the
police officers, their evidence assumes the character of mere surplusage, which
does not vitiate the judge’s conclusion that Leaney was one of the persons
shown on the video screen.  To put it another way, the judge, properly
instructing himself, concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that Leaney
participated in the break‑in.

 

18         
Similarly in R. v. L. (D.O.), [1993] 4 S.C.R. 419, L’Heureux‑Dubé
J., in concurring reasons, noted that the modern trend has been to admit all
relevant and probative evidence and allow the trier of fact to determine the
weight which should be given to that evidence, in order to arrive at a just
result.  She observed that this is most likely to be achieved when the decision
makers have all the relevant probative information before them.  She wrote at
p. 455, that “[i]t would seem contrary to the judgments of our Court (Seaboyer
and B. (K.G.) . . .) to disallow evidence available through
technological advances, such as videotaping, that may benefit the truth seeking
process”.

 

VI.    Some Comparisons
Between Videotape Evidence and that of Eyewitnesses

 








19         
Thus the importance and usefulness of videotapes have been recognized. 
This is as it should be.  The courts have long recognized the frailties of
identification evidence given by independent, honest and well-meaning
eyewitnesses.  This recognized frailty served to emphasize the essential need
to cross‑examine eyewitnesses.  So many factors come into play with the
human identification witness.  As a minimum it must be determined whether the
witness was physically in a position to see the accused and, if so, whether
that witness had sound vision, good hearing, intelligence and the ability to
communicate what was seen and heard.  Did the witness have the ability to
understand and recount what had been perceived?  Did the witness have a sound
memory?  What was the effect of fear or excitement on the ability of the witness
to perceive clearly and to later recount the events accurately?  Did the
witness have a bias or at least a biased perception of the event or the parties
involved?  This foreshortened list of the frailties of eyewitness
identification may serve as a basis for considering the comparative strengths
of videotape evidence.

 

20         
It cannot be forgotten that a robbery can be a terrifyingly traumatic
event for the victim and witnesses.  Not every witness can have the fictional
James Bond’s cool and unflinching ability to act and observe in the face of
flying bullets and flashing knives.  Even Bond might have difficulty accurately
describing his would be assassin.  He certainly might earnestly desire his
attacker’s conviction and be biased in that direction.

 

21         
The video camera on the other hand is never subject to stress.  Through
tumultuous events it continues to record accurately and dispassionately all
that comes before it.  Although silent, it remains a constant, unbiased witness
with instant and total recall of all that it observed.  The trier of fact may
review the evidence of this silent witness as often as desired.  The tape may
be stopped and studied at a critical juncture.

 








22         
So long as the videotape is of good quality and gives a clear picture of
events and the perpetrator, it may provide the best evidence of the identity of
the perpetrator.  It is relevant and admissible evidence that can by itself be
cogent and convincing evidence on the issue of identity.  Indeed, it may be the
only evidence available.  For example, in the course of a robbery, every
eyewitness may be killed yet the video camera will steadfastly continue to
impassively record the robbery and the actions of the robbers.  Should a trier
of fact be denied the use of the videotape because there is no intermediary in
the form of a human witness to make some identification of the accused?  Such a
conclusion would be contrary to common sense and a totally unacceptable
result.  It would deny the trier of fact the use of clear, accurate and
convincing evidence readily available by modern technology.  The powerful and
probative record provided by the videotape should not be excluded when it can
provide such valuable assistance in the search for truth.  In the course of
their deliberations, triers of fact will make their assessment of the weight
that should be accorded the evidence of the videotape just as they assess the
weight of the evidence given by viva voce testimony.

 

23         
It is precisely because videotape evidence can present such very clear
and convincing evidence of identification that triers of fact can use it as the
sole basis for the identification of the accused before them as the perpetrator
of the crime.  It is clear that a trier of fact may, despite all the potential
frailties, find an accused guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on the basis of the
testimony of a single eyewitness.  It follows that the same result may be
reached with even greater certainty upon the basis of good quality video
evidence.  Surely, if a jury had only the videotape and the accused before
them, they would be at liberty to find that the accused they see in the box was
the person shown in the videotape at the scene of the crime committing the
offence.  If an appellate court, upon a review of the tape, is satisfied that
it is of sufficient clarity and quality that it would be reasonable for the
trier of fact to identify the accused as the person in the tape beyond any
reasonable doubt then that decision should not be disturbed.  Similarly, a
judge sitting alone can identify the accused as the person depicted in the
videotape.

 

VII.   Use of
Photographic Evidence in Other Jurisdictions

 

A.     United Kingdom

 

24         
The question as to whether a jury could, without other evidence, use a
photo taken by a security camera to identify the accused arose in R. v.
Dodson, [1984] 1 W.L.R. 971 (C.C.A.).  In that case it was unanimously held
that the photographs were relevant and admissible evidence that could be used
by the jury to identify the accused.  The position was put in this way at
pp. 978‑79:








 

We entertain no doubt that photographs taken by
the process installed and operated in the branch office of the building society
are admissible in evidence.  They are relevant to the issues as to (a) whether
an offence was committed and (b) who committed it.  What is relevant is,
subject to any rule of exclusion ‑‑ we know of none which is
applicable to this situation, prima facie admissible. . . .

 

Moreover, we reject the attempt here made to
persuade this court to prevent a jury from looking at photographs taken by
means of this technique, looking at a defendant in the dock and then to
conclude if it be safe to do so that the man in the dock is the man shown in
the photographs.

 

                                                                   . . .

 

It is, however, imperative that a jury is warned by
a judge in summing up of the perils of deciding whether by this means alone or
with some form of supporting evidence a defendant has committed the crime
alleged.  According to the quality of photographs, change of appearance in a
defendant and other considerations which may arise in a trial, the jury’s task
may be rendered difficult or simple in bringing about a decision either in
favour of or against a defendant.  So long as the jury having been brought face
to face with these perils are firmly directed that to convict they must be sure
that the man in the dock is the man in the photograph, we envisage no injustice
arising from this manner of evaluating evidence with the aid of what the
jurors’ eyes tell them is a fact which they are sure exists.  [Emphasis
added.]

 

25         
These conclusions were repeated and affirmed by the same court in R.
v. Downey, [1995] 1 Cr. App. R. 547.  Thus the English courts have come to
the conclusion that photographic evidence may, without more, be considered by a
trier of fact in determining whether the accused before them is the person
appearing in the photograph.  In my view, there cannot be any distinction
between a still photograph and a videotape.  Indeed, a videotape may well
provide stronger evidence than a still photograph.

 

B.  United States of America

 








26         
The current edition of Wigmore (Wigmore on Evidence, vol. 3
(Chadbourn rev. 1970), § 790) indicates a change in the position of the writers
of the text.  Earlier editions took the position that the photograph may be
admissible only as the testimony of a qualified eyewitness who, instead of
giving a verbal description of what the picture portrays, adopts it as a
substitute for his or her description.  This was known as the “pictorial
testimony” theory of photographs.  However, with the advances in the art of
photography and an increasing awareness of the evidentiary uses of photographs,
the Wigmore text now recognizes that once there is an adequate assurance of the
accuracy of the process producing the picture, the photograph should be
received as a so‑called silent witness or as a witness which “speaks for
itself”.  The text puts the position in this way at pp. 219‑21:

 

These consequences remain to be more fully
considered.  It is sufficient to note at this point that, by universal judicial
concession, a map, model, or diagram, takes an evidential place simply as a non‑verbal
mode of expressing a witness’ testimony....

 

Upon like principles a photograph may be admissible
as the testimony of a qualified witness who instead of verbalizing his
knowledge of what the picture portrays, adopts it as a substitute for
description with words.

 

                                                                   . . .

 

This theory which has been aptly dubbed the
“pictorial testimony theory of photographs”, was advanced in prior editions of
this work as the only theoretical basis which could justify the receipt of
photographs in evidence.  With later advancements in the art of photography,
however, and with increasing awareness of the manifold evidentiary uses of the
products of the art, it has become clear that an additional theory of
admissibility of photographs is entitled to recognition.  Thus, even though no
human is capable of swearing that he personally perceived what a photograph
purports to portray (so that it is not possible to satisfy the requirements of
the “pictorial testimony” rationale) there may nevertheless be good warrant for
receiving the photograph in evidence.  Given an adequate foundation assuring
the accuracy of the process producing it, the photograph should then be
received as a so‑called silent witness or as a witness which “speaks for
itself.”

 

The demands of this theory for recognition and the
inadequacies of the older view to meet the modern needs of forensic proof are
tellingly put in the following forceful opinion:

 








Peters J., in People v. Bowley, 59 Cal. 2d
855, 859, 382 P.2d 591, 594, 31 Cal. Rptr. 471, 474‑475 (1963): 
According to Professor Wigmore, a photograph is no more than the nonverbal
expression of the witness upon whose foundation testimony its authenticity
rests. (3 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed. 1940) §790, pp. 174‑175; ibid.
§792, p. 178; ibid. §793, p. 186.  See International Union etc. v.
Russell, 264 Ala. 456, 88 So. 2d 175, 186, 62 A.L.R.2d 669.)  It is merely that
witness’ testimony in illustrated form; a “pictorial communication of a
qualified witness who uses this method of communication instead of or in
addition to some other method.”  (3 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed. 1940) §793,
p. 186.) . . .

 

Other authorities disagree.  They urge that once
a proper foundation has been established as to the accuracy and
authenticity of a photograph, “it speaks with a certain probative force in
itself.”  (Scott, Photographic Evidence (1942) §601, p. 476.) 
“(P)hotographs may, under proper safeguards, not only be used to illustrate
testimony, but also as photographic or silent witnesses who speak for
themselves. . . . (A) picture taken with adequate equipment under proper
conditions by a skilled photographer is itself substantive evidence to be
weighed by the jury.” (Gardner, The Camera Goes to Court (1946) 24 N.C.L.
Rev. 233, 245.  See State v. Goyet, 120 Vt. 12, 132 A.2d 623, 631; A. & N.
Dept. Stores v. Retail etc. [1950] 2 D.L.R. 850; McKelvey, Evidence (5th ed.
1944) 663‑664.)

 

Until now, this court has not been called upon to
state the theory upon which photographs are admitted into evidence.  (See
Comment, 8 Hastings L.J. (1957) 310.)  In doing so we recognize that
photographs are useful for different purposes.  When admitted merely to aid a
witness in explaining his testimony they are, as Wigmore states, nothing more
than the illustrated testimony of that witness.  But they may also be used
as probative evidence of what they depict.  Used in this manner they take on
the status of independent “silent” witnesses.  (See McKelvey, Evidence (5th
ed. 1944) §379, p. 668).

There is no reason why a photograph or film,
like an X‑ray, may not, in a proper case, be probative in itself.  To
hold otherwise would illogically limit the use of a device whose memory is
without question more accurate and reliable than that of a human witness. 
It would exclude from evidence the chance picture of a crowd which on close
examination shows the commission of a crime that was not seen by the
photographer at the time.  It would exclude from evidence pictures taken with a
telescopic lens.  It would exclude from evidence pictures taken by a camera set
to go off when a building’s door is opened at night.  (See Scott, Photographic
Evidence (1942) §197, pp. 211‑213; Crim.L.Rev. [1957] p. 708.) 
We hold, therefore, that a photograph may, in a proper case, be admissible
into evidence not merely as illustrated testimony of a human witness but as
probative evidence in itself of what it shows.  [Underlining added.]

 

27         
Thus, it is apparent that there is in the United Kingdom and in the
United States strong support for the position advanced in these reasons.

 








VIII. Summary of the
Positions as to the First Issue (the Use That Can Be Made of Photographs or
Videotape)

 

28         
Once it is established that a videotape has not been altered or changed,
and that it depicts the scene of a crime, then it becomes admissible and
relevant evidence.  Not only is the tape (or photograph) real evidence in the
sense that that term has been used in earlier cases, but it is to a certain
extent, testimonial evidence as well.  It can and should be used by a trier of
fact in determining whether a crime has been committed and whether the accused
before the court committed the crime.  It may indeed be a silent, trustworthy,
unemotional, unbiased and accurate witness who has complete and instant recall
of events.  It may provide such strong and convincing evidence that of itself
it will demonstrate clearly either the innocence or guilt of the accused.

 

29         
The weight to be accorded that evidence can be assessed from a viewing
of the videotape.  The degree of clarity and quality of the tape, and to a
lesser extent the length of time during which the accused appears on the
videotape, will all go towards establishing the weight which a trier of fact
may properly place upon the evidence.  The time of depiction may not be
significant for even if there are but a few frames which clearly show the
perpetrator that may be sufficient to identify the accused.  Particularly will
this be true if the trier of fact has reviewed the tape on several occasions
and stopped it to study the pertinent frames.

 








30         
Although triers of fact are entitled to reach a conclusion as to
identification based solely on videotape evidence, they must exercise care in
doing so.  For example, when a jury is asked to identify an accused in this
manner, it is essential that clear directions be given to them as to how they
are to approach this task.  They should be instructed to consider carefully
whether the video is of sufficient clarity and quality and shows the accused
for a sufficient time to enable them to conclude that identification has been
proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  If it is the only evidence adduced as to
identity, the jury should be reminded of this.  Further, they should be told
once again of the importance that, in order to convict on the basis of the
videotape alone, they must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that it
identifies the accused.

 

31         
The jury or trial judge sitting alone must be able to review the
videotape during their deliberations.  However, the viewing equipment used at
that time should be the same or similar to that used during the trial.  I would
think that very often triers of fact will want to review the tape on more than
one occasion.

 

32         
A trial judge sitting alone must be subject to the same cautions and
directions as a jury in considering videotape evidence of identification.  It
would be helpful if, after reviewing the tape, the trial judge indicated that
he or she was impressed with its clarity and quality to the extent that a
finding of identity could be based upon it.  This courtesy would permit Crown
or particularly defence counsel to call, for example, expert evidence as to the
quality of the tape or evidence as to any changes in appearance of the accused
between the taking of the videotape and the trial and to prepare submissions
pertaining to identification based on the tape.

 

IX.     Application
of the Criteria Pertinent to Videotape in the Case at Bar

 

33         
The Court of Appeal correctly recognized that the trial judge could
properly consider the videotape, which they conceded was clear and of high
quality.  Despite this, they appear to have concluded that there had to be some
corroboration of the tape itself before the trial judge could rely upon it to
identify the accused.  On this point, I must respectfully disagree.








 

34         
I viewed the tape and it is indeed of excellent quality and great
clarity.  The accused is depicted for a significant period of time.  At one
point, it is almost as though there was a close‑up of the accused taken
specifically for identification purposes.  There is certainly more than
adequate evidence on the tape itself from which the trial judge could determine
whether or not the person before her was the one who committed the robbery. 
The fact that the store clerk could not identify the accused is not of great
significance.  When the tape is viewed, it is easy to appreciate that the clerk
might not have been able to properly focus upon the identity of the robber. 
The violent and savagely menacing jab made by the robber with a large knife
directed towards the clerk suggests that self‑preservation, not
identification, may very reasonably have been the clerk’s prime concern at the
time of the robbery.  Yet, the tape remained cool, collected, unbiased and
accurate.  It provides as clear a picture of the robbery today as it did when
the traumatic events took place.

 

35         
The evidence of the tape is of such clarity and strength that it was certainly
open to the trial judge to conclude that the accused before her was the person
depicted on the tape.  The trial judge was aware of the difficulties and
frailties of identification evidence and acknowledged them in her reasons. 
Nonetheless, she was entitled on the evidence before her to conclude beyond a
reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.  There was no need for
corroboration of this tape.

 








36         
There was no suggestion that the tape had been tampered with or that it
did not represent the commission of the crime.  Indeed there was quite properly
no objection to its admission.  The videotape can and should speak for itself. 
It provided the convincing evidence upon which the trial judge could properly
base her finding of fact that the accused was the person shown in the tape. 
The trial judge did not err in finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the
accused was guilty of the robbery.  It follows that I can find no basis upon
which the Court of Appeal was justified in concluding that the decision of the
trier of fact was unreasonable or unsafe.

 

37         
I would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the order of the Court of
Appeal and restore the conviction of the respondent.

 

The reasons of Sopinka and Major JJ. were delivered by

 

38         
Sopinka J. (dissenting) --
I have read the reasons of Cory J. and while I agree that the observation of
the videotape by the trial judge who compared the videotape of the crime with
the accused was evidence of identification, I agree with the unanimous decision
of the Court of Appeal that, in the circumstances of this case, it was
unreasonable for the trial judge to convict based on her opinion alone.  In
order to arrive at this conclusion, it is necessary to review the evidence.

 

I.       Facts

 

39         
On May 13, 1991, at approximately 2:00 a.m., Mr. Mahmood Wahabzada was
working alone at a Mac’s Milk store when an individual entered the store and
told him to open the cash register.  The robber took about $230 and left the
store.  The robber’s face was not covered, but he was wearing something on his
head.  Mr. Wahabzada described the robber to police as hefty with a strong
build, blond hair and a mustache.  He said that his own height was 175
centimetres and that the robber was taller than that.

 








40         
A few days after the robbery, Mr. Wahabzada was shown a series of
photographs by police in an album containing 12 colour photographs.  Two police
officers testified about Mr. Wahabzada’s comments in response to the
photographs.  They attributed varying degrees of certainty to his choice of
photograph number 6, which was conceded to have been a photograph of the
respondent, as a photograph of the man who robbed him.  According to the
officers, Mr. Wahabzada said, “that’s him”, or “He looks just like him”, when
pointing to number 6, but also said, “He looks a bit like him also”, referring
to number 8.  This evidence was at variance with the evidence of Mr. Wahabzada
who stated that he suspected photographs number 6, 8 and 11, but that he could
be no more than 25 or 30 percent sure that any of them was the robber.  He was
more sure that it was number 8 than the other two.  Number 6 was conceded to be
a photograph of the respondent.  The evidence at trial was, in part, as
follows:

 

Q.       I’m showing you an album, as you called it, having twelve
pictures in it.  Is this what you were shown by the officers?

 

A.       Yeah.

 

Q.       All right.  And were you able to recognize
anyone, sir?

 

A.       Yeah.  I suspect this man -- and either this one or this one
-- I think this one.

 

Q.       All right.  Do you remember what you said?

 

A.  Yeah, I say that I suspect only twenty-five percent or thirty
percent, no more than that.

 

Q.       On which one?

 

A.       On these both guys.  Mostly this guy.

 

THE COURT:  Middle row, Photos 6 and 8 -- twenty-five percent mostly this
guy, being Photo 8.

 

MR. COLLINS: Thank you.

 

THE COURT: And I’m doing 8 counting four across the top, and then 5
through 8 as the second line.

 

MR. COLLINS: Does the Crown confirm the judge’s?

 

MR. VESA: Yes.  He’s also pointing at Number 11.

 








THE COURT: And he also in his first comment said this looks like, and
he pointed to Number 11 as well.

 

MR. VESA: Q.  Were you able to come to a more definite conclusion than
that, sir, as to which picture?

 

A.  I can’t.

 

Q.  Do you remember if you did on that day?

 

A.  Mostly on this guy.

 

THE COURT: Mostly 8.  [Emphasis added.]

 

 

41         
During his testimony at trial, Mr. Wahabzada was shown a videotape which
he identified as an accurate depiction of the robbery in the store on May 13,
1991.  After having reviewed the videotape, and while the respondent was seated
alone in the prisoner’s box, Mr. Wahabzada was asked in examination-in-chief by
the Crown:

 

Q: Do you see the man here today who robbed you that night, sir?

 

A: No, I don’t think he is.

 

Q: You don’t think he?

 

A: No.  

 

42         
An officer testified that when he arrested the respondent on May 22,
1991, his facial appearance was different from that in court, in that at the
time of the arrest the respondent had a sparse mustache.  The officer also testified
that, upon being arrested, the appellant denied his involvement in the robbery
and offered an alibi, stating that he had been at home with his mother and
brother at the time of the robbery.

 








43         
When the Crown closed its case, there was no evidence on the record of
identification except the trial judge’s subjective conclusion with respect to
her observation of the video which, at that point, was unannounced and
unknown.  In these circumstances, counsel for the respondent elected to call no
evidence.  It was only during argument that the trial judge expressed her
opinion based on her observation of the video and the respondent.  Since her
opinion was the only evidence of identification, these remarks concerning what
she had observed became the reasons for judgment.

 

II.     Analysis

 

1.      Section 686(1)(a)(I) of the Criminal
Code

 

44         
In undertaking a review under s. 686(1) (a)(i) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , the appellate court must carefully consider
all of the evidence that was before the trier of fact.  As stated by a majority
of this Court in R. v. S. (P.L.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 909, at p. 915:

 

In an appeal founded on s. 686(1) (a)(i) the
court is engaged in a review of the facts.  The role of the Court of Appeal is
to determine whether on the facts that were before the trier of fact a jury
properly instructed and acting reasonably could convict.  The court reviews the
evidence that was before the trier of fact and after re-examining and, to some
extent, reweighing the evidence, determines whether it meets the test.

 

 








As a result,
it is only where the Court has considered all of the evidence before the
trier of fact and determined that a conviction cannot reasonably be supported
by that evidence that the Court can invoke s. 686(1) (a)(i) and overturn
the trial court’s verdict.

 

45         
This power of review by an appellate court takes on special significance
in a case in which the sole issue is identification.  In R. v. Quercia
(1990), 60 C.C.C. (3d) 380 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 383, Doherty J.A., speaking for
himself and Osborne J.A., stated:

 

This is a case in which the conviction of the appellant depends
entirely on the identification of him by the victim.  Where the Crown’s case
rests on eyewitness identification, one is always very concerned about the
reliability of a finding of guilt.  Legal history and data compiled by
behavioural scientists demonstrate the validity of that concern: see “Pretrial
Eyewitness Identification Procedures”, Law Reform Commission of Canada Study
Paper (1983), at p. 7-15.  The spectre of erroneous convictions based on
honest and convincing, but mistaken, eyewitness identification haunts the
criminal law.  That ghost hovers over this case.

 

Section 686(1) (a)(i) of the Criminal Code 
mandates limited appellate review of the sufficiency of the evidence on appeals
from convictions.  An appellate court must set aside a conviction if that
verdict “is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence”.  The review
countenanced by s. 686(1) (a)(i) is not limited to a determination
of whether there was any evidence to support the conviction....

 

 

46         
In my view, a review of the evidence in this
case makes it clear that the verdict rendered at trial was
""unreasonable"" within the meaning of s. 686(1)(a)(i) of the Code. 
Indeed, it would appear that the respondent was convicted on the basis of very
weak identification evidence, which was undermined by the evidence of the
Crown's only eyewitness.  In assessing the ""reasonableness"" of the
evidentiary foundation upon which the conviction was entered, it is necessary
to consider two fundamental questions.  First, are the sensory observations of
a trial judge, based on a review of a videotape and the appearance of the
accused, admissible evidence of ""identity"" to support a guilty
verdict?  If this first question is answered in the affirmative, the Court must
go on to consider whether or not the evidence of identity in this
particular case was sufficient to justify the respondent's conviction.  








 

2.      Videotape Identification

 

47        
The appellant relies
heavily on this Court's decision in R. v. Leaney, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 393. 
The appellant submits that Leaney clearly establishes that the sensory
observations of a trial judge, based on a review of a videotape and
observations of the accused, are admissible to prove the identity of the
accused as the person who was displayed on the video screen.  While I agree
that the principles in Leaney support the appellant's position on the
first question, they fail to support the ""reasonableness"" of the
verdict rendered at trial on the facts of this case.

 

48        
In Leaney, the
accused (Leaney) was videotaped with his co-accused (Rawlinson) breaking into
the Owl Drug Mart in Edmonton, Alberta.  At trial, the following evidence was
admitted to establish Leaney's ""identity"" as the man on the
videotape:

 

(a)  Five police officers
who had viewed the videotape affirmed that the accused were the men depicted on
the tape;

 

(b)  Leaney's fingerprints
and palm prints were found on ""Owl Drug Mart boxes"" that had been
found in Rawlinson's apartment after the robbery;

 

(c)  Leaney had been seen
in Rawlinson's apartment the day before the robbery;

 

(d)  Leaney and Rawlinson
matched a ""general description"" of the culprits given by an
eyewitness; and

 








(e)  Rawlinson admitted his
participation in the crime, although this admission was not evidence against
Leaney.

 

 

The trial judge considered this evidence,
and compared Leaney's appearance with that of the man on the videotape.  In
light of all of the evidence, Leaney was convicted.

 

49        
On appeal, the Court
of Appeal determined that the evidence of four of the five police officers was
inadmissible as non-expert opinion concerning identity.  The fifth officer
(Sergeant Cessford), however, was familiar with Leaney and was able to note
specific physical characteristics and idiosyncrasies of the accused that were
also exhibited by the man on the videotape. The majority of the Court of Appeal
held that even if the trial judge erred in admitting Cessford’s evidence
without first holding a voir dire, such an error made no difference to
the outcome of the trial.  The majority therefore dismissed the appeal.

 

50        
A majority of this
Court agreed with the Court of Appeal that the identification evidence given by
the four policemen (other than Cessford) was inadmissible.  With respect to
Sergeant Cessford, the Court was of the view that his evidence was admissible notwithstanding
the trial court's failure to hold a preliminary voir dire.  The Court
was of the view that the evidence of the police was unnecessary, however, given
the judge's opportunity to view the video and the accused.  According to the
majority, at p. 414:  

 








The
trial judge viewed the videotape several times and had ample opportunity during
the course of the sixteen-day trial to form an opinion as to whether the
persons shown on the tape were the accused.  The tape contained several face shots
of each accused.  At the end of the trial, the trial judge stated that he had
formed the firm conclusion that the persons shown on the videotape were the
accused.  His pronouncements make it clear that this opinion was formed
independently of the evidence of any of the police officers on the question.

 

The Court went on to state, at p. 415,
that:

 

Given
the trial judge's clear statement that he arrived at his conclusion as to
identity independently of the evidence of the police officers, their evidence
assumes the character of mere surplusage, which does not vitiate the judge's
conclusion that Leaney was one of the persons shown on the video screen.

 

51         
The Court concluded that since the observations of the trial judge were
not tainted by the inadmissible identification evidence of the police officers,
these observations together with the other admissible evidence justified the
application of s. 686(1) (b)(iii) (formerly s. 613(1)(b)(iii)). 
At page 416, McLachlin J., for the majority, states:

 

The test set out in Colpitts v. The Queen, [1965] S.C.R. 739 is
met: there is no possibility that a reasonable jury, properly instructed and
acting judicially, could fail to convict on the admissible evidence
presented on the break-in incident. [Emphasis added.]

 

 

52         
Accordingly, Leaney does not support the proposition that
reliance by a trial judge on his or her own observations unaided by other
evidence is reasonable.

 








53         
Leaney does support the proposition that the judge’s observations
are evidence, and were in that case cogent evidence, that might have survived
an attack under s. 686(1) (a)(I).  It is useful to contrast the quality
of the video identification evidence in Leaney with the evidence in this
case.

 

54        
In Leaney, the
trial judge had reviewed the tape repeatedly and spent 16 days at trial
observing Mr. Leaney's appearance.  In rendering his decision, the trial judge
in Leaney made the following observations in support of his conclusion
that the accused was the man on the videotape:

 

The two
persons responsible for the commission of the offence came into the range of
the camera.  Again, the lighting was good, focus was good but I could see no
distortion of the picture whatsoever.... 

 

The
taller of the two, second person; on the video, he appears dark, long hair,
Metis or Native appearance, very tall, much taller than Rawlinson and there's a
perfect example when they are standing back to back when the hips of the taller
man are almost to the height of the shoulders of Rawlinson, much taller man. 
Wearing a peaked cap of a baseball type which subsequently shows in the video a
tree on the right-hand side of the indicator on the front of the cap which is
similar to a cap seized by the police and was an exhibit.  He's wearing a
down-filled type ski jacket, jeans with jacket, appearing above the waist, a
comb, round shaped tail, in the right rear pocket.  These are not as good__there
is not as good a view of this face of this person, but again having had the
opportunity to view the video and the accused, Frank Leaney in the court over
16 days, I have no difficulty in saying without hesitation that they are one
and the same; the man in the video is Frank Leaney.

 

 

The thoroughness of the comparison made
between the accused and the tape in Leaney was stressed in this Court's
comments on the quality of the evidence.  As McLachlin J. stated at p. 414:

 

The
trial judge viewed the videotape several times and had ample opportunity during
the course of the sixteen-day trial to form an opinion as to whether the
persons shown on the tape were the accused.  The tape contained several face
shots of each accused.

 

 








55        
Clearly, the detailed
observations made in Leaney stand in contrast to the remarks made by the
judge in the instant case.  After a trial that was completed in one day, and
after having viewed the 30-second video only once, the trial judge made the
following ""observations"":

 

I looked
at that video, and I looked at it very carefully, and I can honestly tell you
there is no doubt in my mind that the man who committed that robbery on that
video was your client.

 

                                                                    ...

 

How can
I disregard that?  I don't need glasses. 

 

                                                                    ...

 

This
particular video tape is very clear.  The lighting is very good.  The man is in
the camera for long enough to make a careful observation.  And the issue of
beyond a reasonable doubt is when I'm obliged to make a decision, and I cannot
ignore what my eyes tell me, and my eyes tell me, and there's no dispute this
isn't a video tape of the robbery, that the person who committed that robbery
is Mr. Nikolovski, and I can't ignore that and I can't say well -- I don't see
how I can ignore that properly.

 

 








Unlike the trial judge's decision in Leaney,
the trial judge in this case made no reference to specific characteristics of
the man on the videotape that conformed to the appearance of the accused. 
Generally, testimony by a person not acquainted with the accused that the
accused is the culprit without any description of identifying features of
appearance such as colouring of the skin or hair, complexion, facial features,
height, weight, age and clothing is little more than an expression of opinion
and is generally accorded little weight.  See R. v. Spatola, [1970] 4
C.C.C. 241 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 249.  Moreover, the trial judge in this case
lacked the assurance of confirmatory evidence (such as the cap and fingerprints
in Leaney) that would have supported her observations of the video and
the accused.  

 

56         
Not only did the trial judge’s observations not have any support
in the evidence but, more importantly, the judge’s observations were actually
contradicted by the evidence of the only person who actually witnessed the
crime.  Mr. Wahabzada, the victim
of the robbery, had viewed his assailant ""in the flesh"" and
effectively testified that Mr. Nikolovski was not the villain.  Like the trial
judge, Mr. Wahabzada viewed the 30-second tape of the crime in question, and
was present in the courtroom and able to make careful observation of the
accused.  Despite this opportunity to view the accused and the tape, Mr.
Wahabzada was unable to conclude that the accused was the man on the video. 
Indeed, Mr. Wahabzada went so far as to say that the villain was not present in
the courtroom, while the accused was seated alone in the prisoner's box.

 








57         
In addition to the other frailties to which I have referred, it is
significant that the judge’s observations are entirely untested by
cross-examination.  Cross-examination in identification is of special
importance.  Here, not only was there no opportunity to cross-examine, but the
substance of the judge’s observations was unknown until the case for both the Crown
and defence was closed.  Not only are the judge’s subjective observations not
tested by cross-examination but they cannot be tested on appeal.  In order to
evaluate the reasonableness of the evidence upon which a trier of fact relies,
the Court of Appeal must be able to examine all the evidence.  All we can do is
see one side of a coin that has two sides.  All the assurances about the
clarity of the video are of no avail if we cannot see the person with whom the
comparison is being made.

 

58         
In summary, this conviction was based on evidence that amounted to no
more than the untested opinion of the trial judge which was contradicted by
other evidence that the trial judge did not reject.  This included evidence
that the victim, a few days after the robbery, identified a person other than
the accused as the more likely perpetrator of the crime.  The trial judge
simply relied on her own observations, the accuracy of which we are not in a
position to assess.  Having regard for the inherent frailties in identification
evidence, I conclude that the conviction rests on a shaky foundation and is
unsafe and unsatisfactory.  I am satisfied that the verdict is unreasonable and
cannot be supported by the evidence.

 

59         
I would dismiss the appeal.

on appeal from the court of appeal for quebec

                    Criminal
law — Offences — Uttering threats — Elements of offence — Actus reus — Mens rea
— Respondent stating to fellow detainees that he would kill and/or harm Crown
prosecutor, officer‑investigator and witnesses involved in his trial — Whether
it is necessary to prove threats were conveyed to their subjects and/or that
accused intended they be so conveyed — Whether lower courts erred in finding
that elements of offence not made out — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46 ,
s. 264.1(1) (a).

                    While
the accused was detained awaiting trial, he stated to fellow detainees that he
would take down the guys at the top to rearrange the face of the prosecutor and
one of the witnesses because he thought that he was the one who snitched on
him.  The accused also stated that he had hired a private detective to find the
prosecutor’s address, and asked one of the detainees to do what was necessary
to find the address of the officer‑investigator.  The accused further
asserted that once his trial was over, he would kill the witnesses who had
informed against him.  The accused was acquitted of five counts of uttering
threats on the basis that the mens rea of the offence had not been established
because the words were not conveyed by the accused with the intent that they be
transmitted to the subjects of the threats in an attempt to influence their
actions.  The Court of Appeal dismissed the Crown’s appeal.

                    Held: 
The appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.

                    The actus reus
of the offence of uttering threats will be made out if a reasonable person
fully aware of the circumstances in which the words were uttered or conveyed
would have perceived them to be a threat of death or bodily harm.  The Crown
need not prove that the intended recipient of the threat was made aware of it,
or if aware of it, that he or she was intimidated by it or took it seriously.  Nor
must the words be directed toward a specific person; a threat against an ascertained
group of people is sufficient.  

                    The mens
rea of the offence is made out if the accused intended the words uttered or
conveyed to intimidate or to be taken seriously.  It is not necessary to
prove an intent that the words be conveyed to the subject of the threat or that
the accused intended to carry out the threat.  A subjective standard of fault
applies.  However, in order to determine what was in the accused’s mind, a
court will often have to draw reasonable inferences from the words and the circumstances,
including how the words were perceived by those hearing them.  

                    In
this case, both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal erred in law in finding
that the elements of the offence had not been made out.  With respect to the actus reus
of the offence, the Court of Appeal erred in concluding that the words uttered
by the accused did not amount to threats because they were not conveyed to
their intended recipients and they did not cause anyone to be fearful or
intimidated.  It is not necessary to prove that the threats were conveyed to
their intended recipients or to prove that anyone was actually intimidated or
made fearful as a result of the words uttered in order to make out the
prohibited act of the offence.  As for the mens rea of the offence, both
the trial judge and the Court of Appeal erred in finding that in order to make
out the fault element it was necessary to prove that the accused intended the
words to be transmitted to their objects/recipients and specifically intended
to intimidate the ultimate objects of the threats.  In other words, each failed
to consider the disjunctive nature of the fault element required for the
offence.  It would have been sufficient had the accused intended that the
threats be taken seriously by those to whom the words were spoken.  

                    The
Crown has met its burden to demonstrate that the trial judge’s legal error with
regard to the fault element might reasonably be thought, in the circumstances
of this case to have had a material bearing on the acquittal.  Indeed, had the
trial judge not erred as to that element of the offence, he would have had to
consider whether the accused intended his threatening words to be taken
seriously and the evidence of two witnesses provided some basis to conclude
that he did.  Accordingly, the acquittals should be set aside.  However, this
is not the clearest of cases where this Court’s power to enter a conviction
should be exercised.  A new trial is therefore required to determine whether
the charges against the accused will be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

I.       Introduction 

[1]                             
This appeal provides an opportunity to consolidate
and clarify the elements of the offence of uttering threats. In particular, it
raises two issues:

(1)              
In order for the offence to be made out, is it
necessary to prove that the threats were conveyed to their subjects and/or that
the accused intended that they be so conveyed?

 

(2)              
If the trial judge erred in this respect, has
the Crown discharged its burden to have the acquittals entered at trial set
aside?

[2]                             
We conclude that the offence does not require
proof that the accused’s threats were conveyed to their subject or that someone
was actually intimidated by them. Further, the Crown need not establish that
the accused intended that the threats be conveyed to their subject or to
intimidate anyone. In our view, and with respect to the contrary opinion of the
Court of Appeal, the trial judge made legal errors in his analysis of the
offence and the Crown has met its burden of showing that these errors might
reasonably be thought to have had a material bearing on his decision to acquit.
We would, therefore, allow the appeal and order a new trial. 

II.     Facts and Proceedings

A.     Overview of the Facts

[3]                             
In June of 2009, the respondent Stéphane McRae
was detained awaiting trial on several charges relating to trafficking in
narcotics. For a time, Louis-Joseph Comeau, Édouard Collin, and Patrick
Cloutier were also detained at the same detention centre.  The respondent
introduced Mr. Comeau to Mr. Cloutier as his [translation]
“contract killer”.  At times, Mr. Cloutier passed on
messages from Mr. Comeau to the respondent.

[4]                             
Based on the statements of Édouard Collin and
Patrick Cloutier, various charges of uttering threats were laid against the
respondent and Mr. Comeau. Mr. Comeau was convicted of uttering threats in a
separate trial (R. v. Comeau, 2010 QCCQ 20939 (CanLII)). At issue on
this appeal are five counts of knowingly conveying to Patrick Cloutier and
Édouard Collin, at various times between June 1, 2009, and September 5, 2009,
threats to cause death or bodily harm, contrary to s. 264.1(1) (a) of the
Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , to: the Crown prosecutor; an
officer-investigator; and four witnesses involved in the case being brought
against the respondent and Mr. Comeau for trafficking narcotics. 

[5]                             
At trial, it was established, among other
things, that the respondent had: (1) told Mr. Collin that he would take down
the guys at the top to rearrange the face of the Crown prosecutor and one of
the witnesses because he thought that he was the one who snitched on him; (2)
informed Mr. Cloutier that he had hired a private detective to find the Crown
prosecutor’s address; (3) asked Mr. Cloutier to do what was necessary to find
the address of the officer-investigator; and (4) told Mr. Cloutier that once
his trial was over he would kill the witnesses who had informed against him (2010
QCCQ 9043 (CanLII), at para. 6). 

B.     Court of Québec, 2010 QCCQ 9043 (Decoste J.)

[6]                             
The respondent did not testify at trial (appeal
decision, 2012 QCCA 236 (CanLII), at para. 18). The trial judge found that
Messrs. Cloutier and Collin were credible witnesses
(para. 12), but held that the fault element (the mens rea) of the
offences had not been established because the words were not conveyed by the
respondent with the intent that they would be transmitted to the subjects of
the threats in an attempt to influence their actions (paras. 14-15). He found
that the respondent rather intended to seek revenge once the trial was done,
and that he had uttered the words out of anger and frustration (paras. 14 and
16).

C.     Court of Appeal, 2012 QCCA 236 (Rochette and Giroux JJ.A.
and Viens J. (ad hoc))

[7]                             
The Court of Appeal confirmed the trial judge’s
decision with regard to the fault element (paras. 16-18), and added that the
prohibited act (the actus reus) had not been established because
the words were uttered in a “closed circle” ― i.e. with an expectation of
confidentiality ― and thus they could not instill fear in the subjects of
the threats (paras. 8-9). The court confirmed the trial judge’s finding that
the respondent acted out of frustration and with an intention to seek revenge
rather than an intention to intimidate (para. 16).

III.    Analysis

A.     The Applicable Law

[8]                             
The respondent is charged with the offence of
uttering threats, provided for in s. 264.1(1) (a) of the Criminal Code :


     264.1 (1) Every one commits an offence who, in any manner, knowingly utters, conveys or causes any person to receive a
threat

 

                                 (a) to cause death or bodily
harm to any person;

[9]                             
This Court has previously considered this
offence in R. v. McCraw, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 72, R. v. Clemente,
[1994] 2 S.C.R. 758, and more recently in R. v. O’Brien, 2013 SCC 2,
[2013] 1 S.C.R. 7. The elements of the offence include: (1) the utterance or
conveyance of a threat to cause death or bodily harm; and (2) an intent to
threaten. We review here the law relating to each element.

              (1)   The Prohibited Act (Actus Reus) 

[10]                         
The prohibited act of the offence is “the
uttering of threats of death or serious bodily harm” (Clemente, at p.
763). The threats can be uttered, conveyed, or in any way caused to be received
by any person. The question of whether words constitute a threat is a question
of law to be decided on an objective standard. Justice Cory put it this way in McCraw:

The structure and wording of
s. 264.1(1) (a) indicate that the nature of the threat must be looked at
objectively; that is, as it would be by the ordinary reasonable person. . . .

 

     The question to be
resolved may be put in the following way. Looked at objectively, in the context
of all the words written or spoken and having regard to the person to whom they
were directed, would the questioned words convey a threat of serious bodily
harm to a reasonable person? [pp. 82-83]

[11]                         
The starting point of the analysis should always
be the plain and ordinary meaning of the words uttered. Where the words clearly
constitute a threat and there is no reason to believe that they had a secondary
or less obvious meaning, the analysis is complete. However, in some cases, the
context reveals that words that would on their face appear threatening may not constitute
threats within the meaning of s. 264.1(1) (a) (see, e.g., O’Brien,
at paras. 10-12). In other cases, contextual factors might have the effect of
elevating to the level of threats words that would, on their face, appear
relatively innocent (see, e.g., R. v. MacDonald (2002), 166
O.A.C. 121, where the words uttered were “You’re next”). 

[12]                         
For example, in R. v. Felteau, 2010 ONCA
821 (CanLII), the accused had told a mental health care worker that he was
going to follow Ms. G, his former probation officer, and “assault” her (paras.
1-2).   The trial judge found that the words did not constitute a threat
because the threat must be of death or bodily harm and the accused’s reference
to “assault” did not necessarily include bodily harm (para. 3). The Court of
Appeal for Ontario found that the trial judge had erred in looking at the word
“assault” in isolation from the circumstances (para. 7). The court held that
the factors relevant to the determination of the meaning of the words included
the facts that: the accused was fixated upon Ms. G and had very recently been
convicted of harassing her; he was angry with Ms. G when he uttered the words;
he blamed her for his arrest and detention; and he was mentally unstable, had
been consuming cocaine and had a known history of serious violence directed at
women (para. 8). The Court of Appeal concluded that the accused’s words, viewed
in these circumstances, would convey a threat of bodily harm to a reasonable
person (para. 9).

[13]                         
Thus, the legal question of whether the accused
uttered a threat of death or bodily harm turns solely on the meaning that a
reasonable person would attach to the words viewed in the circumstances in
which they were uttered or conveyed. The Crown need not prove that the intended
recipient of the threat was made aware of it, or if aware of it, that he or she
was intimidated by it or took it seriously (Clemente, at p. 763; O’Brien,
at para. 13; R. v. LeBlanc, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1583 (confirming the trial
judge’s instruction that it was not necessary that “the person threatened be
ever aware that the threat was made”: (1988), 90 N.B.R. (2d) 63 (C.A.), at
para. 13)).  Further, the words do not have to be directed towards a specific
person; a threat against an ascertained group of people is sufficient (R. v.
Rémy (1993), 82 C.C.C. (3d) 176 (Que. C.A.), at p. 185, leave to appeal
refused, [1993] 4 S.C.R. vii (threat against “police officers” generally); R.
v. Upson, 2001 NSCA 89, 194 N.S.R. (2d) 87, at para. 31 (threat against
“members of the black race” generally)).

[14]                         
The reasonable person standard must be applied
in light of the particular circumstances of a case. As the Court of Appeal for
Ontario explained in R. v. Batista, 2008 ONCA 804, 62 C.R. (6th) 376:

     An ordinary reasonable
person considering an alleged threat objectively would be one informed of all
the circumstances relevant to his or her determination.  The characteristics of
a reasonable person were considered by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v.
S. (R.D.), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 484 (S.C.C.), in the context of the test for
bias.  In that case, L’Heureux-Dubé and McLachlin JJ., at para. 36, described
such a person as a:

 

reasonable,
informed, practical and realistic person who considers the matter in some
detail. . . .  The person postulated is not a “very sensitive or scrupulous”
person, but rather a right-minded person familiar with the circumstances of the
case.

 

Similarly, in R. v.
Collins, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265 (S.C.C.), at p. 282, in the context of the
test for bringing the administration of justice into disrepute, Lamer J. for
the majority describes a reasonable person as “dispassionate and fully apprised
of the circumstances of the case”: see also R. v. Burlingham, [1995] 2
S.C.R. 206 (S.C.C.), at para. 71.

 

     It follows that a
reasonable person considering whether the impugned words amount to a threat at
law is one who is objective, fully-informed, right-minded, dispassionate,
practical and realistic. [Emphasis added; paras. 23-24.]

[15]                         
Thus, while testimony from persons who heard or
were the object of the threat may be considered in applying this objective
test, the question in relation to the prohibited act is not whether people in
fact felt threatened. As the Court of Appeal for Ontario put it in Batista, witness opinions are
relevant to the application of the reasonable person standard; however, they
are not determinative, given that they amount to personal opinions
and “d[o] not necessarily satisfy the requirements of the legal test” (para. 26).

[16]                         
To conclude on this point, the prohibited act of
the offence of uttering threats will be made out if a reasonable person fully
aware of the circumstances in which the words were uttered or conveyed would
have perceived them to be a threat of death or bodily harm. 

              (2)   The Fault Element (Mens Rea)

[17]                         
The fault element is made out if it is shown
that threatening words uttered or conveyed “were meant to intimidate or to be
taken seriously” (Clemente, at p. 763).

[18]                         
It is not necessary to prove that the threat was
uttered with the intent that it be conveyed to its intended recipient (Clemente,
at p. 763) or that the accused intended to carry out the threat (McCraw,
at p. 82). Further, the fault element is disjunctive: it can be established by
showing either that the accused intended to intimidate or intended that
the threats be taken seriously (see, e.g., Clemente, at p. 763; O’Brien,
at para. 7; R. v. Neve (1993), 145 A.R. 311 (C.A.); R. v. Hiscox,
2002 BCCA 312, 167 B.C.A.C. 315, at paras. 18 and 20; R. v. Noble, 2009
MBQB 98, 247 Man. R. (2d) 6, at paras. 28 and 32-35, aff’d 2010 MBCA 60, 255 Man. R. (2d) 144, at paras. 16-17; R. v.
Heaney, 2013 BCCA 177 (CanLII), at para. 40; R. v. Rudnicki, [2004]
R.J.Q. 2954 (C.A.), at para. 41; R. v. Beyo (2000), 47 O.R. (3d) 712
(C.A.), at para. 46).

[19]                         
The fault element here is subjective; what
matters is what the accused actually intended. However, as is generally the
case, the decision about what the accused actually intended may depend on
inferences drawn from all of the circumstances (see, e.g., McCraw, at p.
82). Drawing these inferences is not a departure from the subjective standard
of fault. In R. v. Hundal, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 867, Justice Cory cites the
following words from Professor Stuart which explain this point:

In trying to ascertain what was
going on in the accused’s mind, as the subjective approach demands, the trier
of fact may draw reasonable inferences from the accused’s actions or words at
the time of his act or in the witness box.  The
accused may or may not be believed.  To conclude that, considering all the
evidence, the Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused
“must” have thought in the penalized way is no departure from the subjective
substantive standard.  Resort to an objective substantive standard would only
occur if the reasoning became that the accused “must have realized it if he had
thought about it”. [Emphasis added: p. 883.]

[20]                         
O’Brien is an
example. The person targeted by the threat ― the accused’s ex-girlfriend
― had testified that she had not been frightened by the accused’s words.
The trial judge strongly relied on this evidence to conclude that, despite the
fact that the words on their own appeared threatening, she was left with a
reasonable doubt as to whether the accused had the necessary intent to threaten
(2012 MBCA 6, 275 Man. R. (2d) 144, at para. 34). The perception of the alleged
victim was not directly in issue, but was relevant evidence of the accused’s
intent.

[21]                         
Similarly, in Noble, the court had to
determine if the accused intended to be taken seriously when he uttered the words
“I guess we know whose house is going to burn down”, immediately followed by
“just kidding” and laughter (trial decision, at para. 1).  The accused had
uttered the words to a sheriff’s officer as he was returning to prison from
court after having been sentenced for threatening to kill the Crown attorney
who had successfully prosecuted him for robbery.  The trial judge found that in
spite of the remark’s off-the-cuff nature and the absence of any indication
that the accused was angry or upset when he uttered the words, when viewed in
the larger context, the accused was aware that his words, which were very
specific, would be taken seriously as a threat against that same Crown attorney
(paras. 33-35).  After the first time the accused had threatened the Crown
attorney, she had been the victim of an attempted home invasion. Although it
was not alleged that the accused was involved, he told the media that the Crown
attorney had gotten what she deserved. After she was made aware of the
accused’s reference to a house burning, the Crown attorney took the comment
seriously and was very frightened by it. As a result, she and her partner sold
their house (trial decision, at paras. 2-19).  In addition to the Crown
attorney’s reaction to the threats, the fact that the accused knew that
criminal sanctions flowed from threatening language, as a result of having just
been sentenced to two years’ imprisonment for uttering threats, was also an
important factor with regard to the fault element in this case (para. 34). The
trial judge concluded that the words might “have been blurted out on the spur
of the moment, or driven by bravado, but given all the circumstances . . . the
evidence demonstrate[d] that the accused was aware that it would be taken
seriously” (para. 35).

[22]                         
The Court of Appeal for Manitoba confirmed the
factual findings of the trial judge, specifically the contextual analysis she
undertook with regard to the fault element (Noble, at para. 17).

[23]                         
To sum up, the fault element of the offence is
made out if the accused intended the words uttered or conveyed to intimidate or
to be taken seriously. It is not necessary to prove an intent that the
words be conveyed to the subject of the threat. A subjective standard of fault
applies. However, in order to determine what was in the accused’s mind, a court
will often have to draw reasonable inferences from the words and the
circumstances, including how the words were perceived by those hearing them. 

B.     First Issue: Is the Confidential Nature of a Threat
Relevant to the Analysis?

[24]                         
In our view, both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal erred in law
in finding that the elements of the offence had not been made out because the
threats were conveyed in a so-called “closed circle”. Even if it is true that
the respondent could have expected his words to remain confidential, a
conclusion we would not necessarily be ready to confirm, this does not preclude
a finding that both the prohibited act and the fault element of the offence had
been made out. This is so because, as explained above, it is not necessary to
prove that the threats were conveyed to their intended recipients (prohibited
act) or that the accused intended the threats to be so conveyed (fault
element). Further, it is not necessary to prove that anyone was actually
intimidated by the threats (prohibited act) or that the accused specifically
intended to intimidate anyone (fault element). The concept of the “closed
circle” is therefore legally wrong.  Threats are tools of intimidation and
violence.  As such, in any circumstance where threats are spoken with the
intent that they be taken seriously, even to third parties, the elements of the
offence will be made out.  As we explain below, the trial judge erred in both
respects with regard to the fault element, and the Court of Appeal erred in
both respects with regard to the prohibited act and the
fault element. 

              (1)   The Prohibited Act 

[25]                         
The trial judge did not specifically address the
prohibited act of the offence. For its part, the Court of Appeal found that the
“words used by the respondent, considered objectively, may raise serious
concerns that acts likely to cause death or bodily harm will occur at the
respondent’s behest” and that this was “in fact what the respondent’s fellow
inmates understood him to mean” (para. 8). However, the court found that “when
these words and comments are put in context”, they did not constitute a threat
(para. 8). The court described that context as follows:

     The comments transmitted or
conveyed by the respondent to three fellow inmates cannot be likened to a “tool
of intimidation which is designed to instill a sense of fear in its recipient”;
rather, it is on par with a threatening letter that is never sent in the mail.
These conversations took place in a closed circle. The mere expression of a
thought is not enough to attribute a criminal act. As the trial judge rightly
pointed out, there is no “recipient” here. The comments made are [translation] “an expression of a
criminal’s frustration and outrage at feeling caught by the judicial system”.
The element of fear instilled in a victim is therefore absent. [para. 9]

[26]                         
In sum, the Court of Appeal concluded that the
words did not amount to threats because they were not conveyed to their
intended recipients and they did not cause anyone to be fearful or intimidated.
As we see it, in light of the legal principles reviewed above, the court erred in this conclusion: in our view, it is not
necessary to prove that the threats were conveyed to their intended recipients
or to prove that anyone was actually intimidated or made fearful as a result of
the words uttered in order to make out the prohibited act of the offence.

              (2)   The Fault Element 

[27]                         
The trial judge’s reasons only addressed the fault
element of the offence. He held that the fault element had not been made out because [translation]
“the evidence d[id] not establish that the words used by the accused when
addressing Collin and Cloutier were intended to reach the ears of the possible
or potential witnesses” [1]
 (para. 14). He found that it would have been different if the respondent
intended to convey a message to the potential informers in order to dissuade
them from testifying (para. 14). Similarly, he found that the respondent could
not have imagined that if Mr. Cloutier and Mr. Collin conveyed the words to the
Crown prosecutor or the officer-investigator that their attitude might change
(para. 15). Thus, in the trial judge’s opinion, the respondent did not have the
necessary intent to utter threats towards any of the complainants.

[28]                         
The Court of Appeal for Quebec confirmed the
trial judge’s findings that the words “were [not] intended to reach the
ears of the possible or potential witnesses” and that Mr. Cloutier and Mr.
Collin were not “supposed to, either implicitly or explicitly, convey this
message to the persons concerned” (para. 16). In short, the fault element was
not made out because there was no intent to intimidate (para. 16). The court
concluded, with regard to the fault element:

     The respondent did not present any evidence and he
did not testify. It is difficult to know what he was thinking. Did he believe
that his comments would be reported and could scare the persons contemplated in
his plans? The judge rejected this theory, deeming it to be neither likely nor
logical. It may be that the judge speculated on this matter, but the fact
remains that the burden of proving wrongful intent ― that is, the
respondent’s intent to attempt to intimidate ― rested with the Crown,
who failed to discharge it. [Emphasis added; para. 18.]

[29]                         
In our view, both the trial judge and the Court of
Appeal erred in finding that in order to make out the fault element it was necessary to prove that the accused intended the words to be
transmitted to their objects/recipients and specifically intended to intimidate
the ultimate objects of the threats. It would have been sufficient had the
respondent intended that the threats be taken seriously by those to whom the
words were spoken.

C. Second Issue: Should the Acquittal Be Set Aside?

[30]                         
To succeed on appeal against an acquittal, the
Crown must show that the legal error or errors of the trial judge “might
reasonably be thought, in the concrete reality of the case at hand, to have had
a material bearing on the acquittal” (R. v. Graveline, 2006 SCC 16,
[2006] 1 S.C.R. 609, at para. 14). 

[31]                         
As we explained above, the trial judge erred
with regard to the fault element in finding that it was
necessary to prove that the respondent intended his threats to be conveyed to
the intended victims in order to intimidate them. He acquitted the respondent
on the basis of a lack of intent to convey the threats and failed to consider
the disjunctive nature of the fault element required for this offence: either
the intent to intimidate, or the intent to be taken seriously.

[32]                         
In spite of this error of law, the trial judge
made a number of findings potentially relevant to the respondent’s intent. We
must therefore consider whether these findings were affected by the legal error
and if not, whether they provide a legal basis for the trial judge’s decision
to acquit. As we see it, the judge’s findings are inextricably linked to his
legal error as to the necessary intent and do not provide a correct legal basis
for the acquittals.

[33]                         
The trial judge found, with regard to the fault element, that the respondent’s intent was [translation]
“to seek revenge once the trial was over because they [the witnesses] had
informed on him” (para. 14). He found that the respondent’s words were “the
expression of a criminal’s frustration and outrage at being caught by
the judicial system” and that the respondent was simply “show[ing] his
anger: in fact, in one case he said that he would act once his sentence was
served, and in another he asked for help in finding the address of a police
officer” (para. 16).

[34]                         
The role of these findings in the respondent’s acquittal is undermined
by the trial judge’s legal error in relation to the required intent,
specifically that he thought the intent had not been proved because the
respondent did not intend that his words would be conveyed to the objects of
the threats. This error caused the trial judge to fail to consider whether the
respondent intended the threats to be taken seriously. 

[35]                         
The trial judge found that Mr. Cloutier and Mr. Collin were credible
witnesses and that they were both of the opinion that the threats were serious
and they feared that murders would be committed (para. 12).  Had the trial
judge not erred as to the fault element of this offence, he would have had to
consider whether the accused intended his threatening words to be taken
seriously and the evidence of Mr. Cloutier and Mr. Collin provided some basis
to conclude that he did (see O’Brien (S.C.C.), at paras. 10-12). 

[36]                         
Furthermore, the trial judge’s finding that the
words were spoken out of anger or frustration does not avoid the difficulty
that he failed to consider whether the respondent intended the words to be
taken seriously.  The respondent’s [translation]
“frustration and outrage at being caught by the judicial system” speak to his motive
for saying what he did, and not necessarily his intent as to how his
words should be received.  As this Court noted in Lewis v. The Queen,
[1979] 2 S.C.R. 821, at p. 831, “the mental element, the [fault element] with which the court is concerned, relates to ‘intent’, i.e.
the exercise of a free will to use particular means to produce a particular
result, rather than with ‘motive’, i.e. that which precedes and induces
the exercise of the will”.

[37]                         
As a result, we conclude that the Crown
has met its burden to demonstrate that the trial judge’s legal error “might
reasonably be thought, in the concrete reality of the case at hand, to have had
a material bearing on the acquittal” (Graveline, at para 14).  We would
therefore set aside the acquittals.

[38]                         
While the Crown asks this Court to exercise its
discretion under s. 686(4)  of the Criminal Code  and enter a conviction,
we are of the view that a new trial is required in this case.

[39]                         
In order to set aside an acquittal and enter a
conviction, we must be satisfied that “the trial judge’s findings of fact,
viewed in light of the applicable law, supported a conviction beyond a
reasonable doubt” (R. v. Katigbak, 2011 SCC 48, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 326, at
para. 50). This is a power that should be used only in the clearest of cases (R.
v. Audet, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 171, at para 48).

[40]                         
As noted above, the trial judge made no findings
with regard to the respondent’s intent to be taken seriously.  The trial
judge’s finding that the respondent said the words out of anger or frustration
or a desire for revenge goes to his motive for saying the words, and not
necessarily his intention.  It is reasonably possible that he was
motivated by anger or frustration or by the desire for revenge, and yet did not
intend to be taken seriously.  Questions of motive and intent are two separate
inquiries and, given the trial judge’s legal errors, we cannot be certain what
he would have found had he turned his mind to the correct legal question.  This
is not the clearest of cases.  Accordingly, a new trial is required to
determine whether the charges against the respondent will be proved beyond a
reasonable doubt.

The respondent was arrested on 20 January 1994 at about 10pm by officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) who found him hiding in the toilet of flat #10-13, Blk 71, Circuit Road, Singapore. The respondent admitted to the arresting officers that he had disposed of some heroin down the rubbish chute; and when one of the officers went down to the chute on the ground floor of the block to investigate, he discovered the said heroin in the form of two long straws, 14 shorter straws and one sachet. The respondent identified these items as the drugs he had thrown down the chute. On analysis the said items were found to contain a total of 1.98g of diamorphine.
The respondent pleaded guilty in the subordinate courts to a charge of possessing a controlled drug under s 8(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) and was sentenced to six months` imprisonment by the district judge. Subsequently, however, the prosecution brought this appeal against the sentence. It was pointed out that the respondent had previously, on 1 March 1980, been convicted of possession of a controlled drug under the then s 6(1) of the 1973 edition of the Misuse of Dugs Act. The prosecution asserted that the then s 6(a) of the 1973 edition constituted the predecessor to the present s 8(a) of the 1985 edition, being identical in its terms; and that the respondent`s conviction in the present case under s 8(a) of the 1985 edition of the Act should therefore be regarded as a `
 second or subsequent offence 
` meriting the mandatory minimum sentence of two years` imprisonment called for under the Second Schedule to the Act.
Having perused the Act in its present as well as in its former editions, I agreed with the submissions of the deputy public prosecutor. The 1985 edition presently in use is in fact a reprint of the original Act (Act 5 of 1973). Indeed the 1985 edition is not even the first reprint: the first reprint was issued in 1978, this being Reprint 2 of 1978. The respondent`s conviction in 1980 under s 6(a) of the 1973 edition of the Act subsists, however, as a `
 previous conviction 
` for the same offence that now stands delineated by s 8(a): it would be absurd to hold otherwise. The process of reprinting in itself means only that the legislation in question is reproduced in a form in which the original Act has incorporated into it the amendments made to it after its initial enactment: see for example 
 Pearce and Geddes on Statutory Interpretation in Australia 
 (3rd Ed) at p 159. So far as the offence of possessing a controlled drug is concerned, however, its definition has remained unaltered between the various reprints. The only change that has been wrought lies in the stricter punishment now provided for second or subsequent offenders in the Second Schedule to the 1985 edition of the Act. Under the Second Schedule to the original 1973 edition, the sentencing judge had a choice of imposing on such an offender a minimum of two years` imprisonment 
 or 
 a fine of $3,000 (or, for that matter, both). In the 1978 reprint the fine was raised to $4,000. The choice between imprisonment and a fine has been removed in the 1985 edition of the Act, which provides exclusively for a minimum custodial sentence of two years without the option of a fine only. Clearly the intention of Parliament was to ensure stricter punishment for persons repeatedly found in possession of controlled drugs; and it would be an absurd denial of Parliament`s intention if, in considering whether an accused should be punished as for a `
 subsequent offence 
`, the courts were to ignore his past convictions for the same offence on the mere basis that these convictions had taken place under an earlier edition of the Act.
Regard should be had in this respect to the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in . The respondent in that case was convicted in July 1991 on a charge of drunken driving under s 67(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276). He had in fact been previously convicted in March 1990 on a similar charge, also under s 67(1) of the Act. In April 1990, however, the then s 67(1) had been repealed by an Amendment Act which substituted a new s 67(1) providing for enhanced punishment for `
 second or subsequent 
` offenders. Counsel for the respondent argued that he should be treated as a first offender under the new s 67(1). It was contended that the former s 67(1) formed no part of the corpus juris of Singapore, having been repealed; and that as the provision creating the offence of drunken driving was the re-enacted s 67(1), the offence referred to by the word `
 conviction 
` must mean a conviction under the re-enacted s 67(1). The Court of Criminal Appeal was asked to rule on the question of whether a court, for the purposes of sentencing an accused convicted under the new s 67(1), should take into account the accused`s previous conviction under the same section before the amendment and impose the minimum sentenced provided for in the new section. It answered the question in the affirmative. Warren LH Khoo J, in delivering the judgment of the court, stated at pp 847-848: 
 
The conviction of the respondent under s 67(1) before the `repeal` is a fact which did not cease to exist on the repeal. He remained as a person who had been so convicted ... (T)here is no question of the `repeal` affecting the subsistence of this fact ... We have no doubt at all that what Parliament intended to do was simply to enhance the punishment for persons found guilty of driving while under the influence of alcohol and drugs. What was changed was the punishment prescribed for persons convicted of the offence. The legislature was particularly intent on dealing severely with repeat offenders. Rather than prescribing a maximum fine and imprisonment term and leaving it to the courts to impose an appropriate punishment up to the maximum, Parliament prescribed the minimum as well. This indicates beyond doubt an intention to see that such criminal conduct is treated with the required degree of seriousness by the courts. If the argument for the respondent is correct, it would lead to the absurd result that a person no matter how many times he has been convicted in the past under the old subsection would be treated as a first offender if he is convicted for the first time under the new subsection. This would obviously defeat the intention of the legislature.
 
 
 
I noted of course the fact that the charge preferred against the respondent in the court below did not state the particulars of his previous conviction, contrary to the requirement of s 158(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC). Section 162 of the CPC provides, however, that `[n]o error in stating either the offence or the particulars required to be stated in the charge and no omission to state the offence or those particulars shall be regarded at any stage of the case as material unless the accused was in fact misled by that error or omission`; and having examined the records in this case, I was satisfied in the circumstances that the respondent had not in fact been misled by the omission.
For the foregoing reasons, I allowed the prosecution`s appeal and revised the custodial sentence imposed on the respondent to the mandatory minimum of two years.

2701276,R v Gouliaditis (No 2) [2016] NSWDC 216,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: I will begin these remarks on sentence by repeating what I said on the last occasion Mr Gouliaditis appeared before me. Drugs are terrible things and users of drugs are often, indeed almost always when they are using drugs, terrible people. They lie, they cheat and they deceive as they pursue their desperate need to obtain drugs. The people who are responsible for much of this misery are drug dealers such as the offender who appears for sentence today. It is for this reason - the harm the drug dealers cause - that ordinarily those who are detected dealing in drugs receive severe, even harsh sentences.
	
	
	This offender’s decision to become a drug dealer to supply his own habit was one made when he was himself addicted to drugs. He decided to fund his addiction by supplying drugs to others. He was not one of those drug dealers who was attracted to that criminal activity by the promise of easy money and a luxurious lifestyle. Nevertheless through his drug dealing activities he exposed others to the awful consequences of drug use and drug addiction. His behaviour was wrong and seriously so.
	
	
	The offender had been a recreational drug user for some time since he was attending university. In 2001 he was fined for three offences of possessing a prohibited drug. He tried to abstain but after that drifted back to using drugs a few years later. His mental health went downhill in around 2012, at that time he broke up with a partner, briefly he reunited but then realised that the relationship would not be re-established. A further stress occurred when his parents became aware of his sexuality. Although his parents are fully supportive of him now their reaction when they learnt that he was a homosexual was not a happy one. He was depressed and used drugs to deal with it. At first ice helped him to deal with his emotions, that drug made it easier for him to work and socialise, but as is always the case such improvement was highly temporary. As his usage increased he became depressed and ashamed and began to hate himself.
	
	
	His drug use escalated to the stage where he was using ice intravenously. He entered what many people have described as a downward spiral. While he had previously been an exemplary employee and a very fine solicitor he began to fail to meet deadlines and unless he was in court he would not even get to work before 11am. His conduct was of such concern to his employers that they had arranged for him to be seen by a psychiatrist, that never came about because he was arrested before the consultation could take place.
	
	
	He became distressed as a result of stresses in the relationship with his third partner, a man who used drugs. As a result of his escalating drug use he was greatly in debt. He owed family members $20,000. On two credit cards he had debts totalling $30,000. And he also had personal loans totalling $17,000. It never occurred to him, such was the level of his addiction, that he could have stopped using drugs. Of course looking back at things later he now realises it would have been better to have been revealed as a drug user than to have become a drug dealer, but that is what he became.
	
	
	He has pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity to two offences, one of ongoing supply of a prohibited drug and another of possessing a prohibited weapon, namely a taser. His drug dealing activities were detected by police who, as part of their investigation, arranged for him to meet an undercover officer. On four occasions she purchased drugs from him. On the first occasion it was .28 grams of methylamphetamine for $200 and 10 mils of 1-4 butanediol for a hundred dollars. A week later he supplied her with a gram of methylamphetamine for $500 and 20 mils of 1-4 butanediol for $200. A further week later he obtained 10.5 grams of methylamphetamine supplying 3.22 grams of that drug to the undercover officer for $1,400. Shortly after that he supplied the undercover officer with 3.5 grams of methylamphetamine for $1,400 and a quantity of 1-4 butanediol for $2,500.
	
	
	Of course it is some comfort that those particular drugs did not actually make it to any users but the offender was not to know that and, in any case, he does not pretend that the only drugs he supplied were drugs to undercover police officers.
	
	
	When I sentence him for the offence of ongoing supply he has asked that I take into account five matters on a Form 1, one of those is an offence of supplying 2.25 grams of methylamphetamine to a man by the name of Gary McCort. The offender supplied him with methylamphetamine on three occasions after which Mr McCort was arrested and the drugs he had in his possession were seized. After he was released by police he contacted the offender and told him that he required further drugs to replace the ones that had been taken from him. The offender did supply him with drugs on that occasion.
	
	
	Also appearing on the Form 1 is an offence of resist arrest. When police arrested the offender he struggled with them. The police were particularly interested in seizing the iPhone that he had in his possession.
	
	
	When police searched him they found 1.38 grams of methylamphetamine and $1,145. The offence of possessing the quantity of methylamphetamine appears on the Form 1 as does an offence of dealing with the proceeds of crime relating to the money found in his possession.
	
	
	Finally when dealing with the Form 1 when police searched the offender’s car they found ten vials containing a total of 106.4 mils of 1-4 butanediol.
	
	
	After his arrest the offender told police that in his room at his home they would find a safe and in the safe they would find a taser. The offender provided police with the electronic code to access the safe and police did find such a prohibited weapon in the safe. The offender explained that a person who was supplying drugs with him tried to get him to buy the taser, when that request was made his partner was with him and he encouraged him to buy the taser, so he took it but never actually formed the intention to buy it. He gave evidence that he had never used the taser as part of his drug dealing activities.
	
	
	So the offender stands to be sentenced for the offence of ongoing supply of prohibited drug and possessing a prohibited weapon. Both offences are very serious. The drug matter carries a maximum penalty of 20 years while the prohibited weapon matter carries a maximum penalty of 14 years with a standard non-parole period of three years. I have taken into account both the maximum penalties and where appropriate the standard non-parole period in deciding on the sentences to impose on the offender. My reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period appear in these remarks on sentence.
	
	
	As I mentioned the offender pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity to those offences. There is also another factor which I will not mention but which is well known to the parties. When I take into account the pleas of guilty and that other factor I have decided to impose a sentence on the offender which is 40% less than it would otherwise have been.
	
	
	There is a principle of law which is well-know and which needs to be applied when drug dealers are sentenced. It is this; those who are trafficking to a substantial degree must receive a sentence of fulltime imprisonment unless there are exceptional circumstances. At least that was the principle of law stated at the time before the sentencing option of an intensive corrections order was available. Whether the principle continues to apply in those terms now that ICO’s are available is a matter worthy of consideration.
	
	
	Ultimately one day the Court of Criminal Appeal may provide some guidance as to whether the introduction of ICO’s as a sentencing option requires some modification of the well-known rule. In EF v R [2015] NSWCCA 36, Simpson JA at para 12 made an observation, she said:
	


“I further observe that, at the time these statements of ‘policy’ or ‘rule’ were made, the option of an intensive correction order did not exist that was introduced into the Sentencing Procedure Act with operation from 1 October 2010...”.


	
	Justice Simpson’s observations is one which has been made on many occasion by judges of this court.
	
	
	In my view it is important to recognise what sentencing options were available at the time the rule was first laid down and then repeated on many occasions. The most significant form of punishment short of fulltime custody was periodic detention. As is well known by the older judges and lawyers, the way periodic detention operated was such that after one third of the sentence had been completed there was no custodial component at all. Indeed it operated from then on more like a community service order than a sentence of imprisonment. One can understand, when that was the most significant punishment short of fulltime imprisonment, the rule that fulltime custody was required in cases where offenders were trafficking to a substantial degree, unless there were exceptional circumstances shown. One could understand why the rule would be stated in those terms, given the sentencing options available to sentencing judges at that time.
	
	
	Intensive corrections orders are, as Simpson JA recognised a new form of sentence. No one could suggest that they approach the severity of fulltime custody but they do involve substantial limitations on a person’s liberty.
	
	
	Of course what I have said thus far about the intensive corrections order option is of less importance if the offender satisfies me that there are exceptional circumstances which would justify a sentence of other than fulltime imprisonment. It has always conceded by Mr Boulten SC, who appears for the offender, that his client was trafficking to a substantial degree.
	
	
	Mr Boulten shouldered the burden of attempting to demonstrate to me that there were such exceptional circumstances. He fully acknowledged that no one circumstance was of itself exceptional, but together he submitted that they did amount to exceptional circumstances justifying a sentence of other than fulltime imprisonment. He referred to the following matters:
	
	
	Firstly there was the offender’s motive. I have already discussed this, this was not a case where the offender dealt in drugs to provide himself with a luxurious lifestyle. To the contrary his life was falling apart in a most unattractive way. His motivation for supplying drugs was to fund his own drug addiction.
	
	
	Secondly Mr Boulten relied on the offender’s psychiatric disorder which arose around the time he decided to sell drugs, for a number of reasons.
	
	
	The third matter relied on by Mr Boulten is something which I will not mention in these publically published remarks but again the parties know what I am talking about and if necessary so will the Court of Criminal Appeal.
	
	
	Fourthly Mr Boulten relied on the substantial remorse demonstrated by the offender. He now acknowledges that lives are destroyed through drug use and that his actions in supplying drugs helped to cause such harm.
	
	
	Mr Boulten relied on 11 months of quasi custody undergone by the offender. He spent 11 weeks in Odyssey House before he was asked to leave, not because of any drug use it should be emphasised, and then eight months in William Booth House from which he successfully graduated with glowing reports.
	
	
	Sixthly there is the topic of extrajudicial punishment. As I have mentioned the offender was a fine young lawyer with much promise. He accepts now that that career is now denied him.
	
	
	Seventhly there is the offender’s particular vulnerability in prison. He suffers from some physical illnesses, and he would no doubt find incarceration a frightening prospect as a result.
	
	
	The final matter relied on by Mr Boulten is the offender’s rehabilitation. When he first appeared before me he had only recently graduated from the Salvation Army program. For only a very short time he had been living in the community away from the highly structured experience of life in William Booth House. He had not used drugs while there and he had no intention of using drugs ever again, but as Major Seymour the then manager at William Booth House recognised, predicting whether he would be rehabilitated for life would be more accurately assessed if he demonstrated a substantial period of being drug free while in the community. Accordingly I adjourned the matter under s 11 of the Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act, over objection from the Crown,. As I explained at the time, his conduct while on the s 11 remand would be of assistance to me in deciding whether fulltime custody was required and if it was how long that should be.
	
	
	Further evidence was tendered today concerning Mr Gouliaditis’ behaviour since I adjourned the matter. His rehabilitation has continued, it has continued to the extent that he is now in fact employed fulltime at William Booth House. After the matter was adjourned he began by volunteering there. There was a staff shortage in January 2016 and the offender accepted casual fulltime employment. In February 2016 the position was offered to him on a permanent basis and Mr Gouliaditis accepted. Thus Mr Gouliaditis is in no small way doing much good for the community, particularly by assisting people of the type he harmed through his drug-dealing activities. Many times in sentencing considerations such as paying back to the community for the harm an offender has caused are taken into account. In this case the offender’s current role very much achieves what he can in that regard.
	
	
	As I mentioned he has harmed many people through supplying drugs to them but he is now assisting such people through his work at William Booth House. One consequence of where he works is that Mr Gouliaditis is almost on a daily basis assessed as to how his rehabilitation is going. A letter from Major Seymour, the offender’s employer was tendered today, he says:
	


“My view is that Nick is doing exceptionally well, he remains honest about the issues that underpinned his addiction and talks positively about how his life (in particular his relationship, family and friends) has improved since graduating from WBH. Importantly he continues to attend chapel every week, meet with his sponsor regularly and attend 12 step meetings. I am also aware that Nick is receiving treatment from a psychiatrist and therapist. These are the foundations of a strong recovery.”


	
	Other material tendered today supports the assertion that the offender’s rehabilitation is proceeding well. There is one qualification to that of course and that concerns a drug screening test conducted on a urine sample which the offender provided on 14 March 2016. Evidence was called as to the nature of the testing which produced that result. The offender gave evidence, expert reports were tendered, Mr Seymour’s letter refers to it and a letter from the offender’s sister was also tendered. I note that the Crown did not object to the hearsay nature of the letters from Mr Seymour and Sabula Gouliaditis, the offender’s sister.
	
	
	The conclusion I have reached regarding the test on 14 March sample is that it was a test which revealed a false positive. I say that for the following reasons: the evidence has established that the test conducted on that sample was a screening test only, it seems to be undisputed that substances other than amphetamine can react in a similar way to amphetamine in such a screening test and that further testing is required to either confirm or disprove the presence of amphetamine once a screening sample suggests that that drug might be present. Unfortunately for the reasons which were explained in evidence, such further testing was not possible on the 14 March sample, it having been destroyed seven days after the screening test was carried out.
	
	
	What I have already said about the nature of the test conducted on 14 March is confirmed by something else. A further screening test conducted in April has the notation FTR, (further testing required) but after such further testing was carried out it was revealed that there was no amphetamine present. That tends to support the assertion that the screening test can produce a false positive.
	
	
	The third factor which has led me to conclude that it was in fact a false positive concerns what is something I mentioned earlier. He was at the time, and still is, working fulltime at William Booth House - a place where many people are highly alert to the effects of drug use on people and could be expected more than almost anyone else in the community to be able to identify when a person has used drugs. Major Seymour, who at that time had daily contact with the offender, saw no indication that he had taken drugs, nor did any other staff at William Booth House raise their concerns that the offender had used drugs with Major Seymour.
	
	
	There was also a letter from the offender’s sister to which I made earlier reference. It is important to note that the test of the sample on 14 March came six days after a negative result from a sample produced on 8 March. Thus if the offender had in fact used drugs it must have been in those six days, yet the letter from Ms Gouliaditis speaks about his movements in those six days and her observations of him over that time. There are also inconsistent with the offender having used drugs in that six day period.
	
	
	I should not also that the offender himself gave sworn evidence that he had not used drugs since he first appeared before me. He was cross‑examined with an appropriate degree of scepticism by the Crown. His answers explained many of the concerns that I might otherwise have had as to whether he truly had given up drugs as he told me had.
	
	
	And then the final matter I took into account regarding the test of 14 March was that after this experience there was a change in the testing facilities used. From then on the offender began to use a testing facility which complied with the relevant Australian Standard. He has been regularly tested since moving to that testing facility and there has been no further suggestion of there being any amphetamines in his urine. For those reasons I am satisfied that the result produced from the testing of 14 March sample was a false positive and did not demonstrate the offender’s use of illegal drugs.
	
	
	As I mentioned earlier, when the matter was first before me the Crown opposed a s 11 remand. It was the Crown’s position at that stage that nothing less than fulltime custody was required. I gather that the Crown has now modified its position. The Crown emphasises that custody of some sort is required but no longer presses for fulltime custody. Sometimes when the Crown agrees with a submission put by counsel for an offender it makes the job of sentencing job harder rather than easier. This is not a jurisdiction where parties can bind the judge about what sentencing outcome is appropriate.
	
	
	I am satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances justifying a sentence of other than fulltime imprisonment. I have determined the length of the sentences to impose upon the offender and after taking into account the discount of 40% to reflect the offender’s early pleas and the other matter, alternatives to fulltime custody thus become available. Given the likelihood of a sentence of two years or less I propose to refer the offender for assessment as to his suitability to serve that sentence by means of an intensive corrections order.
	
	
	There are only two conditions of bail, not to use, any illegal drugs whatsoever and to tell the officer-in-charge if he moves address within 24 hours of having moved.

		15 September 2016",2016-07-21 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2702550,Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Koh [2015] NSWLC 24,"Judgment


	
	The defendant is before the court to be sentenced on two charges of Dealing with Property suspected of being the Proceeds of Crime. Each charge is brought pursuant to section 193C (1) of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for each offence is imprisonment for two years or a penalty of $5500 or both. Each offence is a Table 2 offence for the purpose of section 258 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The charges are to be dealt with summarily before the Local Court. The defendant entered a plea of guilty to each charge on 13 October 2015.
	
	
	The facts are somewhat convoluted. They have a sense of being less than the full narrative. Nonetheless for the purpose of this sentencing exercise the Court will endeavour to reduce them to a simpler account.
	
	
	The defendant is a Singapore national. The facts assert he arrived in Australia on 27 April 2015. It is clear he did so in order to facilitate criminal conduct within New South Wales. He signed the usual declaration to the effect that he did not have more than $10,000 in Australian dollar value on his person. That assertion may or may not have been true.
	
	
	Within 8 days of arrival he deposited $299,650 in cash in a so called ""safe keeping account"" at Star City Casino. This type of account is essentially a safety deposit box secured within the casino. The following day he deposited $703,000 in cash into the same safety deposit box. Although not clear as to when and in what manner records at the Casino indicated some gambling activity on the part of the defendant and withdrawal of a significant portion of cash by him. Police were contacted, presumably by the Casino, and they attended the Casino on 7 May 2015 at 3.00 p.m.
	
	
	The defendant was residing in a hotel next door to the Casino. Within half an hour police attended his hotel room. The defendant told police that the $700,000 deposit came from his Aunt Jin Xiu Sun in Newcastle, was the proceeds of a brothel business and was intended to be given to her ex-husband living in China. He said that in February/March 2015 he had been asked by his ""aunt"" to come and pick up luggage containing the money and put it into safekeeping. He asserted that he attended his aunt's premises, she was not home, he entered the premises through an unlocked back door, found a suitcase in his aunt's bedroom, and took a suitcase he found and left. He said he did not look inside the suitcase.
	
	
	He says that after depositing the contents of the suitcase, $703,000, he subsequently transferred $100,000 to his uncle in China using a money remitter in Chinatown. The defendant gave no explanation for the source of the $299,650. It is implicit in the plea that he knew the cash money was the proceeds of criminal activity. He gave police permission to obtaining the remaining moneys in the safety deposit at Star City Casino. Police removed $600,230 in cash. There is no explanation in the facts for the movement of over $400,000. Police recovered a receipt for the removal of $200,000 on 6 May. In excess of $200,000 appears to be unaccounted for to any plausible detail.
	
	
	Subsequent inquiries by police establish that the ""uncle"" in China does not exist. Contact with the purported source of the $703,000 and her partner, a Gordon Bennett establish that the defendant visited their premises in Newcastle on 28 and 29 March 2015. These are dates that pre-date his arrival in Australia. It is assumed, subject to evidence to the contrary, that where the statement of facts says March it means April. The essence of inquiries of Mr Bennett and Ms Sun establish the defendant is not related to Ms Sun. She denied being the source of $703,000. Whether that is true in fact is unknown.
	
	
	In the course of sentencing proceedings a lengthy affidavit under the hand of a Police Officer Cook was tendered to the Court. The basis of the tender is section 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Sentencing Act). This provision deals with the imposition of a lesser sentence for an offender who provides assistance to authorities.
	
	
	Without disclosing greater detail of the contents of the affidavit it discloses that on the basis of information provided by the defendant some $1.59 million in tainted money has been confiscated and two persons charged with money laundering type offences. The affidavit also asserts the defendant actively participated in controlled conduct on behalf of police that led to the arrest and prosecution of the two persons charged. It is not known to this court whether either or both of the persons in question have been convicted of any offence. I will return to the vexed issue of assistance to authorities shortly.
	
	
	The defendant comes before the Court as a Singapore national. His family remain in Singapore. He is currently detained in Australia on a criminal justice visa. He has no prior record in the Commonwealth. No details of any criminal record elsewhere have been placed before the Court. In that context he is to be sentenced as a first offender and is entitled to rely on previous good character to mitigate the severity of the sentence.
	
	
	Little is known about the offender other than his nationality and the assertion that is expressed within the report of Mr Borenstein dated 7 October 2015. The personal information therein is as one might expect, largely provided by the offender himself. Within that report the defendant asserts that he is employed within the motor vehicle import business and that it was his ""boss"" who sent him to Australia to collect money and send it to China. He says his principle reason for being in Australia was to source the purchase of motor vehicles. There has been no evidence put before this Court to support this assertion. Given the defendant's conduct and intention to facilitate the laundering of a considerable amount of cash money the product of criminal activity within the community it is difficult and certainly unwise to accept that he came to Australia with any legitimate business activity in mind.
	
	
	The plea of guilty entered by the defendant is to be regarded as a plea at close to the first available opportunity. Mindful of the fact that he could have indicated a plea to both charges when first charged in June 2015 and having regard to the principles of general application point 9 set out in the decision of R v Borkowski (2009) 195 A Crim R 1 at [32], there will be a minor adjustment to the commonly applied discount for a plea of guilty at the first available opportunity. The discount will be 22.5%.
	
	
	The discount for assistance to authorities is more problematic. The affidavit from Officer Cook describes the defendant's willing involvement in controlled transactions. As indicated, the offender's role facilitated the arrest and charging of two persons and the confiscation of some $1.59 million dollars in moneys believed to be tainted. It is not known as at the date of sentencing what future role, if any the offender will need to play or is prepared to undertake in terms of prosecutions. Nonetheless where there is a ""promise"" of future assistance. Section 23(4) requires the court to quantify the discount in the exercise of its discretion. Apart from the statutory recognition set out in s 23 of the Sentencing Act the principles behind the adjustment of a sentence on the basis of assistance to authorities is well settled.
	
	
	In R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243 at 252-253 the court observed:
	


It is clearly in the public interest that offenders should be encouraged to supply information to the authorities which will assist them to bring other offenders to justice, and to give evidence against those other offenders in relation to whom they have given such information. In order to ensure that such encouragement is given, the appropriate reward for providing assistance should be granted whatever the offender's motive may have been in giving it, be it genuine remorse (or contrition) or simply self-interest.

… The information which he gives must be such as could significantly assist the authorities. The information must, of course, be true….


	
	There is a reasonable inference to be drawn on the affidavit tendered in these proceedings that the information provided to the authorities is true. The confiscation of such a significant sum of money and the charging of two persons infers that but for the offenders willingness to assist these two arrests and the confiscation of a large sum of money would not have occurred. The Court is prepared, despite the unpredictability as to whether he will be needed to give evidence or is willing to give evidence, to give recognition to the purpose of s 23(4) by further discount to the sentence otherwise appropriate to each charge.
	
	
	This does not mean that each sentence is to be reduced to the point where it becomes unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offending or based on the inherent likelihood the offender will be deported and thereby becomes an outcome of convenience intended to facilitate deportation as opposed to reflecting the seriousness of the offending. What happens to the offender at the culmination of these proceedings is a matter for federal authorities. It is not determinative in the resolution of the charges before this Court.
	
	
	In R v M [2005] NSWCCA 224 at [21]-[22] the approach in determining the level of discount is set out and noted. In R v Holland [2011] NSWCCA 65 at [42] the Court noted that the combined discount should not exceed 50% other than in exceptional circumstances. These proceedings do not fall within that categorisation. It is the view of the Court that the combined discount should not exceed 40%. The question is invariably posited- 40% of what. The resolution of this issue involves not just the quantification of the sentence but also the identification of the type of sentence the court considers commensurate with the objective seriousness of the conduct within the commission of the offence and those provisions of section 21A (2) and (3) of the Sentencing Act that aggravate or mitigate the conduct.
	
	
	Mr Ang of counsel, who assisted the offender on sentence in the fine traditions of the Bar through the Duty Barrister scheme, urged the Court to deal with the charges on the basis of a suspended sentence. Mr Ang drew the court's attention to the particular subjective circumstances of the offender. He is currently at large within the community on a criminal justice visa. It is beyond speculation that he will be deported to Singapore in the not too distant future. The offender asserts his life and that of his family will be in jeopardy if the assistance he has provided becomes known to those who controlled his part in the money laundering enterprise. That may or may not be so.
	
	
	The overall thrust of arguments in favour of the offender being dealt with by way of a suspended sentence suggests that the defendant be regarded as different from citizens of Australia on a basis that he will suffer the consequences of imprisonment more significantly than others because it will entail separation from his family as opposed to available access to a member of the wider community and that this in some way should be taken into account as justification for not imposing a sentence of full time imprisonment. I acknowledge that reality but do not accept it as a reason why there should be a differing approach on sentence to that taken in relation to ordinary members of the community.
	
	
	Ms Dewhurst for the Director has helpfully provided the Court with the decision in Chi Sun Tsui v R (1985) 1 NSWLR 308. The decision is authority for a number of principles but for the purpose of these proceedings, confirmation of the view that sentencing of an offender who may be deported is to be undertaken in a manner no different from that taken in respect of a citizen of Australia and that the relationship between immigration laws and the criminal justice system are two distinct environments where the issue of deportation can have no part to play in respect of sentencing for laws intended to protect the community.
	
	
	Returning to subjective factors there are areas of vagueness in the offender's narrative that are not capable of resolution within these proceedings. Given the level of dishonesty associated with the offender's conduct it would be an unwise court that gave undue emphasis to what might be factual circumstances without better evidence being placed before it. Speculation on subjective issues postulated by the person who has the most to gain from their unexplored acceptance is problematic. This is particularly so when it is clear the defendant's version of his involvement is contradicted to an extent by other persons who may or may not have been engaged in the criminal enterprise.
	
	
	It is important also not to lose sight of the fact that there was a significant degree of planning involved in the defendant's criminal conduct. This attracts a finding of aggravation by reason of s 21A(2)(n). Laundering of ill-gotten gains is serious criminal offending behaviour. The amount of money involved raises the objective seriousness of the conduct. General deterrence is of significant importance. The offender may be able to rely on his prior good character and a degree of accepted remorse and he may have reasonable prospects of rehabilitation however those mitigating factors together with the discount for the plea and assistance do not convince this court that it is appropriate to adopt at face value Mr Ang's suggestion that the offender be given a suspended sentence.
	
	
	Counsel's submission is predicated on an acceptance that the offender's conduct passes beyond the point highlighted in s 5 of the Sentencing Act whereby there is no appropriate alternative than the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment. That threshold view is correct. The nature of the conduct, its capacity to facilitate and maintain criminal offending on a significant scale to the detriment of the community and the amount of money involved all point towards a sentence of condign punishment.
	
	
	In ordinary circumstances the objective seriousness of the conduct and high level of moral culpability that must be found to exist when a foreign national travels to this country in order to carry out criminal activities to the potential benefit of other criminals and to the detriment of Australian law and the Australian community points towards a penalty towards the upper end of the available sentencing options. The maximum penalty in relation to each offence of 2 years imprisonment and/or a fine is the marker set by Parliament in terms of the objective seriousness of the individual offences. Absent the combined discount for the utilitarian value of the plea and assistance to authorities this Court would have been inclined to impose a sentence close to the statutory maximum.
	
	
	Mindful however of the summary disposition of the offences a sentence for each after application of the discount of 40% must logically be significantly less, but not to the extent of being unreasonably disproportionate. Section 23(3) is a clear direction so far as this proposition is concerned.
	
	
	The appropriate sentence for the offence involving the $703,000 would have been 20 months imprisonment before application of the discount. The appropriate sentence for the offence second in time involving $299,650 would have been 15 months. After application of the discount of 40% the head sentences become ones of 12 months and 9 months respectively. At this point in the 3 step process identified in R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 I return to the suggestion the sentences should be suspended. To adopt this suggestion for no greater apparent reason than that the offender would be removed from Australia to return to his place origin and perhaps inspire others to take the risk seems to this Court to be a contrivance that would do little to assist in combating this type of activity within our national borders.
	
	
	The nature of this type of offending and its prevalence highlight the need for general deterrence. The relationship between criminal offending behaviour that produces such significant sums of ill-gotten gains and the involvement of facilitators who knowingly engage in what may be described commonly as “money laundering”, particularly through licensed premises such as a Casino is a relationship and course of conduct that operates to the detriment of the whole community. General deterrence and particular deterrence are both to be pursued in the course of sentencing.
	
	
	As was said by Wood J in R v Taylor [2000] NSWCCA 442 at [49]:
	


Suspended sentences provide little, if anything by way of general deterrence


	
	They would certainly provide no deterrence to those involved in organised crime conducted on a transnational basis such as exhibited in these proceedings. The ability for persons to enter Australia from overseas, facilitate the washing of money through a casino and leave before the agencies of law enforcement are aware of their presence and conduct is such that the need for general deterrence is paramount. I decline to deal with these matters by way of a suspended sentence.
	
	
	The defendant is convicted on each charge. On Sequence 2 and after application of the discount of 40% he is sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum period of 9 months with an additional period of 3 months, a total head sentence of 12 months. On Sequence 4 after application of the discount he is sentenced to a minimum period of 5 months and an additional period of 2 months, a total head sentence of 7 months. The relationship between the two offences in terms of time persuades the Court that the sentences should be served concurrently. Given the short parole period and the fact of the defendant's nationality I decline to order supervision on parole if released. Each sentence is to commence forthwith. The moneys seized are forfeited.

2703705,R v Scott (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 460,"EX TEMPORE Judgment


	
	HER HONOUR: In terms of the application to discharge the jury, just I suppose for the record, the considerations that I have, the advanced stage that the trial has reached, it is day 11, all of the most significant evidence has been given. There were quite considerable delays in getting some of the evidence before the Court and at least in part, I apprehend that that is because some of the witnesses were less than willing to come to court and give their evidence in answer to their subpoena. That is one of the features that I take into consideration when having regard to the determination of the application to discharge the jury.
	
	
	The interests of the accused are of course a significant consideration, but it seems to me, particularly since he has the advantage of very experienced counsel coming into the matter to assist him that there is every likelihood can be ready to proceed within a reasonably short and an acceptably short period and that it seems to me is the preferable approach.
	
	
	It is always in the interests of everyone to bring these matters to finalisation as quickly as can reasonably and justly be done, so, on that basis I refuse the application for a discharge of jury.

2704850,PHAM v R [2014] NSWCCA 115,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:Offences and sentenceThe applicant was sentenced by Judge Blackmore SC in the Sydney District Court on 21 June 2013 in respect of the following offences for which he had entered a plea of guilty in the Local Court.
Count 1 - Supply a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, namely MDMA (quantity 299.2 grams), contrary to s25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years and which carries a standard non-parole period of 10 years.
Count 2 - Supply a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, namely cocaine (1000.8 grams), contrary to s25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life and which carries a standard non-parole period of 15 years.
2There was a Form 1 matter of supplying an indictable quantity of a prohibited drug, namely Methorphan, taken into account on sentence for count 2.
3The sentences imposed by Blackmore SC DCJ were:
Count 1 - Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years, commencing 17 February 2002 and expiring 16 February 2013 with a balance of term of 2 years expiring 16 February 2017.
Count 2 - Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years, commencing 17 February 2013 and expiring 16 February 2020 with a balance of term of 4 years expiring 16 February 2024.
4The total effective sentence was imprisonment with a non-parole period of 8 years and a balance of term of 4 years, such sentence to commence 17 February 2012 and expire 16 February 2024.
Factual Background
5Strike Force Bootleg was established by the Regional Enforcement Squad Surry Hills to investigate the supply of prohibited drugs by Le Vuong and her associates, Huy Thanh, Fong Dang and Thanh Li.  A warrant was granted to authorise an undercover operative (UCO),  to be supplied with prohibited drugs by those offenders.  Five different telephone services used by Vuong were monitored.  The communications showed that Vuong was using coded conversations with the applicant to source and supply prohibited drugs, namely MDMA, on 2 February 2012.
6From 23 January 2012 the UCO established telephone contact with Vuong who advised that she had quantities of ecstasy tablets available for purchase.  On 31 January 2012 Vuong telephoned the applicant and discussed obtaining ""lollies"" (MDMA) for the UCO.  On 1 February 2012 Vuong telephoned the applicant to order 1000 ""eggs"" for the next day and asked about sourcing 500 eggs for the Friday.
7On 2 February 2012 Vuong telephoned the applicant to ask if he had prepared ""one"" egg.  The applicant advised Vuong that the source had to travel some distance and that overseas stock was too expensive.  In a later conversation the applicant and Vuong agreed on the price of $11 per tablet and they made arrangements for the supply to take place that day.
8Later that day, the UCO was supplied with 1,058 ecstasy tablets by Vuong, the applicant and Dang.  The price paid was $13,500.  The tablets were analysed to be 229.2 grams of MDMA with a purity of 4 - 17 percent.  The UCO was also given a small sample of cocaine by Vuong.
9These were the circumstances of the offence in count 1.
10On 7 February 2012 Vuong told the UCO by telephone that she could supply her with one kilogram of cocaine.  They met the following day and discussed the purchase of the one kilogram of cocaine and 1000 ecstasy tablets.  The UCO said that she could buy the drugs on Friday, 17 February 2012 if the price were right.  
11Between 8 February and 17 February 2012 there was considerable communication between Vuong and the applicant via telephone and SMS.  On 16 February 2012 the applicant told Vuong that he did not have ""the stuff"" because he was waiting for a telephone call.  Later that night, the applicant confirmed ""everything is good I have some - I have SMS you already both can be delivered"".  The applicant told Vuong that he could not promise that the supply could be organised by 8am ""but I will try my best"".  The price discussed for the kilogram of cocaine was between $235,000 and $245,000.
12On 17 February 2012 numerous calls and text messages were exchanged between Vuong and the applicant to arrange the supply of the ecstasy tablets and the one kilogram of cocaine.  At 11am Vuong got into the applicant's car in Bankstown and they drove to the Pyrmont area.  They entered the UCO's hotel room in Pyrmont.  After the UCO showed the applicant and Vuong $13,350 in cash, the applicant said to a person on the telephone ""I've checked the paperwork it's all there, yeah quickly all right"".  Vuong told the applicant to hurry up the supplier.  The applicant told the UCO ""I go get egg, I go get egg"" then left the hotel room.
13At 12.10pm the applicant returned to the hotel room with a large open bag of chips, containing a resealable bag of tablets.  He handed this bag to the UCO saying that there were 550 tablets inside.  The bag contained 483 tablets analysed to be 134.6 grams of Methorphan.  This is the offence on the Form 1.
14At 12.42pm Vuong and the applicant left the hotel room.  At 1.31am Vuong returned and told the UCO that there was a delay due to one of the supplier's car having a flat tyre.  The applicant met Dang and Li a short distance away from the hotel.  Dang carried a McDonalds bag as he walked to meet the applicant and Li.
15At 1.42pm the applicant, Dang and Li entered the hotel room.  The McDonalds bag was placed on a table in the lounge room.  Vuong unpacked the McDonalds bag and told Dang and Li to leave the room.  The McDonalds bag contained two heat-sealed plastic bags containing powder.  This powder was later analysed and found to be 1000.8 grams of cocaine with a purity of 63 percent.
16At 1.45pm police entered the hotel room and arrested Vuong and the applicant.  Dang and Li were also arrested.  These were the circumstances of the offence in count 2.
Sentence proceedings
17In relation to objective seriousness, his Honour said:
""The facts reveal a very serious case of drug dealing to a substantial extent.  The Courts have maintained a consistent approach providing condign sentences for such cases.  The seriousness of the offending can also be gauged by the maximum penalties attaching to their commission.  In relation to the offence of supplying a large commercial quantity of prohibited drugs the penalty that attaches is the highest possible maximum penalty that the law provides.  When the facts of each of the cases are addressed individually in my view neither could be said to fall within the middle range of objective seriousness and standard non-parole period need not be applied.  In each case the offenders have pleaded guilty.  Having said that the standard non parole periods remain a guide to the sort of penalties that should be applied.""  (ROS 10.4)
18His Honour assessed the position of Vuong and Pham in the distribution hierarchy as being similar and significant, although their roles were different.  His Honour noted that while Pham might have been closer to the original supplier, he was not the supplier.  His Honour saw Vuong as the person who was obtaining the customers and in a sense, taking more direct risks.  He assessed the level of participation of both as being within the middle range.  His Honour said:
""Because Pham appears to be closer to the ultimate supplier he might be regarded as having a more significant role, but the differences in their roles are not very great.""  (ROS 11.1)
19In relation to the applicant's subjective case, his Honour noted that he had a relatively minor criminal record.  He was aged 39, came from Vietnam and was married with four children.  He and his family escaped Vietnam and were in a refugee camp in Thailand for a number of years before coming to Australia.  Two of his children suffered from autism, one quite seriously.
20The applicant had developed a serious drug addiction and was also abusing alcohol.  At the time of the offending, the applicant was living separately from his wife.  Despite this, the couple appeared to run a successful business at the Flemington Markets where they had a stall.  This business provided financially for the couple and their children.
21His Honour rejected the proposition that the applicant's family background demonstrated extraordinary hardship, thereby requiring a moderation in his sentence.  His Honour was prepared, however, to take the hardship into account but not on the basis that it was extraordinary.
22Despite some depression and his alcohol and drug dependency, his Honour formed the opinion that the applicant had been reasonably successful in that he had always worked, adequately provided for his family and maintained a successful business.  For those reasons, his Honour found that his prospects of rehabilitation were very good.  By reason of the hardship aspects of the applicant's subjective case, his Honour was prepared to find special circumstances.
23The applicant received a discount of 25 percent for his plea of guilty.  In relation to his Honour's start point for sentencing, his Honour said:
""Given the seriousness of the offending had these cases gone to trial and both the offenders been convicted then paying due regard to their respective roles and the subjective circumstances attaching to each a sentence of at least sixteen years of imprisonment would have applied in each case.""  (ROS 13.9)
24Before passing sentence, his Honour said:
""The offences in reality form part of one business of drug dealing.  In that regard the sentences to be imposed can be largely concurrent.  In as much as I have not referred to in detail to s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and the factors outlined therein, I note that I have taken those factors into account on sentence.  I have also taken the standard non-parole periods into account in setting a sentence.""  (ROS 14.3)
APPEAL
Ground 1 - The sentencing judge erred in accepting as providing appropriate comparable sentences those the subject of two decisions of this Court given prior to the High Court decision in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120.
25The applicant submitted that because his Honour did not explain how he arrived at an ""overall"" sentence of 16 years as a start point, he must have relied upon two decision to which he was referred in argument which were Ly v R [2008] NSWCCA 262 and Efstathiadis v R [2009] NSWCCA 319.  The applicant submitted that the Crown had placed reliance on those cases in both written and oral submissions and that they were the only cases to which the Crown specifically referred.
26The applicant submitted that nowhere in submissions, either from the Crown or defence, was it pointed out that these cases were decided before the High Court decision in Muldrock and were therefore potentially infected by error.  The applicant submitted that an examination of Ly showed that the outcome was heavily influenced by an erroneous view of the application of the standard non-parole provisions.  The applicant submitted that there was the same erroneous emphasis in Efstathiadis.
27The applicant submitted that having regard to the erroneous reasoning in those cases, it was not appropriate to rely on their outcomes as providing an appropriate range for this case.  The applicant queried whether, in any event, it was appropriate to consider such a limited number of cases in this way when seeking to establish an appropriate range of sentencing.  The applicant referred to R v Ehrlich [2012] NSWCCA 38 where Adams J observed (at [50]) that because the cases he had reviewed were pre-Muldrock and therefore decided by reference to principles subsequently found to be erroneous, ""the resulting sentences must therefore be treated with more than usual caution"".  The applicant submitted that while Adams J was not supported in that expression of opinion by the other judges, his observation was plainly correct.
28The applicant submitted that the erroneous reliance upon Ly and Efstathiadis was sufficient to establish the first ground of appeal and accordingly this Court was able to re-sentence without the need for him to establish the second ground of appeal.
Consideration
29This ground of appeal is bold.  It seeks to argue that in some unspecified way, the exercise of the sentencing discretion by the primary judge was infected by Muldrock error.  It does so not by reference to what the primary judge said in his sentence judgment but because he may have had in mind the sentences imposed in Efstathiadis v R and Ly v R when sentencing in this case.  This ground of appeal is without foundation and should be rejected.
30At no stage in his judgment did the primary judge refer to the decisions in Efstathiadis v R or Ly v R.  The sentence proceedings were heard over a number of days.  On the first day, the primary judge raised with counsel that given the very serious series of offences, it was a possibility that his client could receive a non-parole period exceeding 10 years.  On 7 June 2013 when the matter was next before the court, the Crown provided brief written submissions to the primary judge which for the first time referred to the decisions in Efstathiadis v R and Ly v R.  In the course of an exchange with both counsel for the defence on that day, his Honour accepted that there were aspects which distinguished those cases from the case before him.
31The fact that there was no reference to either case in the sentence judgment is consistent with his Honour not finding either to be particularly persuasive or relevant.  In that regard, the observation by Spigelman CJ (with whom Grove J and Smart AJ agreed) in Regina v Howard [2004] NSWCCA 348 is pertinent:
""47 This is a reference to some observations made by his Honour in the course of argument.  Those particular observations are not repeated in his remarks on sentence.  The particular matters do not appear to have been taken into account in any adverse way.  A trial judge is entitled to put propositions during the course of argument and to modify those propositions, either as a result of submissions or in the light of further consideration of the relevant material.""
32It has not been suggested, nor could it be, that the primary judge gave the standard non-parole period primary or determinative significance in the formulation of sentence nor did his Honour adopt a two stage approach.  
33In any event, simply demonstrating that a sentencing judge followed R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 before the decision in Muldrock will not of itself be sufficient to demonstrate error (Essex v R [2013] NSWCCA 11 at [30]; Butler v R [2012] NSWCCA 23 at [26]).  The critical issue is whether, guided by the jurisprudence before Muldrock, the primary judge used the standard non-parole period as a mandatory starting point or gave it determinative significance.
34Finally, it is by no means clear that the decisions in Efstathiadis v R and Ly v R were affected by Muldrock error.  In Ly Hislop J (with whom Beazley JA and Harrison J agreed) when dismissing an applicant's appeal against sentence said:
""31 In the end result, the non parole period imposed was 8 years, reflecting a starting point before the discount for the plea of 25 percent of 10 years and 8 months compared to the 15 year standard non parole period.  The applicant also received a finding of special circumstances and the non parole period was 66.7 percent of the total term.  There was therefore a clear allowance made for the applicant's subjective features, including his plea.""
35The mere reference to the standard non parole period is not indicative of error, particularly as occurred in Ly, Hislop J was using it as a guidepost or reference point.
36In Efstathiadis v R, McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Howie and Fullerton JJ agreed) said:
""19 The applicant's submissions are not entirely clear. The written submissions are not entirely clear and it may be that there is confusion between the non-parole period and the total term. A submission was made that the starting point for the overall sentence which, having regard to the discount for the plea, must have been 15 years and 6 months, is greater than the standard non-parole period of 15 years. His Honour actually set a non-parole period of 10 years which is 66% of the standard period. Having regard to his Honour's finding as to the objective seriousness of the offence, the time of the guilty plea and the lack of positive matters in the applicant's subjective circumstances, the non-parole period which his Honour imposed was within the available range.""
37That review of factors in the case does not reveal Muldrock error.  There is a reference to the standard non parole period, but not in an impermissible way.
38It follows that even if his Honour had relied in whole or in part on Efstathiadis v R and Ly v R, that was not indicative of error.  It is a well known fact to which the High Court adverted in Muldrock, that after the commencement of standard non-parole periods, sentences generally were likely to increase.  The cautionary warning by Adams J in Ehrlich, given the purpose of his Honour's analysis in that case, does not mean that cases decided after Way but before Muldrock should not be taken into account in post Muldrock sentence proceedings.
Ground 2 - The sentences are manifestly excessive.
39The applicant noted that in terms of culpability there were two actual supply offences.  The first was 299.2 grams of MDMA, being a commercial quantity of that drug (.125 kgs is a commercial quantity).  The second offence was 1000.8 grams of cocaine being a large commercial quantity of that drug (1 kg is a large commercial quantity).  The applicant submitted that in terms of quantum the amount of the first offence was mid way between a commercial and large quantity and the amount in the second offence was just over the large commercial quantity threshold.  The applicant noted that the primary judge found that the offending did not fall within the midrange of objective seriousness, but below that level.
40The applicant relied upon what he said was a strong subjective case, i.e. a relatively minor criminal record, a serious drug and alcohol addiction, very good prospects of rehabilitation, four children of whom two were autistic, and that the needs of those children would have to be met by the applicant's wife while he was in prison.
41The applicant submitted that so far as a range could be ascertained from more recent decisions, those cases did not support the existence of a range which would allow the sentences here to be regarded as the product of a legitimate exercise of the sentencing discretion.  In support of that proposition, the applicant referred to the decisions of Wienand v R [2013] NSWCCA 202 and Hill v R [2012] NSWCCA 265.  In Wienand the drug was methylamphetamine and the amount was 1848 grams.  The starting point for the sentence was 10 years and 8 months with a non parole period of 7 years and 4 months.  After adjustment for the early plea of guilty, the sentence was 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months.
42Hill was a co-offender of Wienand.  In the District Court the start point was 12 years with a non-parole period of 8 years.  After adjustment for the guilty plea (25 percent) and for past and future assistance (25 percent) the sentence became 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years.  On appeal that sentence was reduced to 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years.
43The applicant relied upon Ehrlich where the quantity of methylamphetamine was 1.615 kgs and where the offender was sentenced after a combined discount of 35 percent to an overall term of 6 years and 6 months with a non parole period of 4 years and 10 months.
44Other cases relied upon by the applicant were Lipton v R [2010] NSWCCA 175 and Parris v R [2013] NSWCCA 5.  Although Lipton came before the Court of Criminal Appeal on a different point, in the District Court the offender was sentenced for two offences, i.e. a large commercial quantity of cocaine (1.09 kgs) and a large commercial quantity of MDMA (.58 kgs).  There was a 25 percent discount for a plea of guilty and culpability was reduced by the activities of an undercover officer luring him into a bigger league than that in which he had previously been involved.  The sentences were a non parole period of 4 years with a balance of term of 3 ½ years for the first count and a non parole period of 3 years on the second count, with a balance of term of 2 years.  The second sentence commenced 6 months before the first, making for an overall non parole period of 4 ½ years with a balance of term of 3 ½ years.
45The applicant submitted that those sentences suggested a range for this level of offender appreciably below that imposed in this case and substantiated the proposition that the sentence imposed here was manifestly excessive.
Consideration
46The decision in Wienand provides little assistance.  The focus in that case was on the issue of parity.  There were four separate acts of supply between 4 November 2010 and 2 December 2010 which were charged as a single count of supplying a large commercial quantity.  To the extent that the court turned its attention to the adequacy of the sentence imposed, it did no more than find that the sentence was not manifestly excessive.  It said nothing about the extent to which the sentence indicated a range.  The matter of Hill depended very much upon its own facts.  It was the element of coercion in his subjective case which led to the significant reduction in his sentence.  
47Having taken into account the reservation suggested by Adams J to the decisions in Ly v R and Efstathiadis v R (Muldrock error not having been identified in those cases), they are of some assistance.  In Ly the quantity of drug was 1101 grams of methylamphetamine with three offences of goods in custody being taken into account on a Form 1.  There was no evidence of the position occupied by Mr Ly in the supply organisation.  He pleaded guilty and the details of the sentence imposed on him have already been set out (see [34] hereof).
48In Efstathiadis v R the quantity of drug was 1.9 kgs of methylamphetamine with a plea of guilty that was not entered at the earliest opportunity.  While the offender was clearly a drug supplier, his position in the supply organisation could not be identified.  The sentence imposed has already been referred to (see [36] hereof).
49In both cases the sentences were within a range similar to that imposed on the applicant.  While the quantity of drug in each case was larger, each of Ly and Efstathiadis was involved in a single supply whereas the applicant was involved in two supplies.  Unlike Ly and Efstathiadis the applicant's position in the drug supply hierarchy was known in that he was dealing more directly with the ultimate supplier than was his co-offender Vuong.
50The Crown identified a number of cases involving the supply of not less than a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug which had been decided by this Court after Muldrock.  It dealt with four cases in considerable detail and then provided a schedule of a further 10 cases which came within the same category.  The purpose of that analysis was to demonstrate that to the extent that there was a range of sentences, which could be imposed for this kind of offence, the sentence imposed on this applicant was not outside that range.
51A case considered in some detail was Paxton v R [2011] NSWCCA 242.  The applicant had a similar subjective case without the element of hardship.  He pleaded guilty to three counts of supply and one count of receiving stolen goods.  The quantity of drugs was significantly higher than the amount in this case, i.e. 8.467 kg of MDMA, 2.314 kg of methylamphetamine and 335.3 g of cocaine.  He was a dealer in a variety of drugs for financial gain.  
52His sentence for the supply of cocaine is of some assistance in that he was sentenced to imprisonment with a non parole period of 6 years and 6 months with a balance of term of 2 years and 2 months.  Although his precise position in the drug supply hierarchy was not identified, he appears to have been a much larger supplier than was the applicant.  However, his sentence was also commensurately larger, i.e. 13 years non parole with a balance of term of 6 years for the MDMA supply and 12 years non parole with a balance of term of 4 years for the methylamphetamine supply.  His total effective sentence imposed following the appeal was imprisonment with a non-parole period of 21 years with a balance of term of 7 years.
53In Aoun v R [2011] NSWCCA 284 the applicant had a strong subjective case.  His offending was not isolated and he was involved in a commercial supply of drugs for profit.  In relation to the supply of a large commercial quantity of MDMA (3.36 kg) he was sentenced to imprisonment with a non parole period of 7 years with a balance of term of 5 years.  For the supply of not less than a commercial quantity of cocaine (989.6 g) he was sentenced to imprisonment with a 7 year non parole period and a balance of term of 3 years and 3 months.
54In Collier v R [2012] NSWCCA 213 the offender had been supplying drugs to a drug network in northern NSW over a period of almost a year.  She was involved in what was described as a high level sophisticated criminal organisation.  Over that period, she had supplied in total over 1 kg of heroin and 1 kg of methylamphetamine.  In relation to the supply of not less than a large commercial quantity of heroin, she was sentenced to a non parole period of 10 years 6 months with a balance of term of 4 years and 6 months and for the supply not less than a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine she was sentenced to a non parole period of 9 years with a balance of term of 3 years.
55In Hsu v R [2012] NSWCCA 248 the applicant had a very difficult upbringing and had been a drug addict since his teens.  He was supplying drugs to two suppliers over a period of just over 3 weeks.  He supplied 732.4 grams of MDMA.  His position was characterised as that of a facilitator or commission agent.  His offence was determined to be slightly below the middle range of objective seriousness.  For the count of supply not less than a large commercial quantity of MDMA, he received a sentence with a non-parole period of 10 years with a balance of term of 3 years and 6 months.
56What is clear from those cases and the cases on the schedule is that the factual circumstances, both of the offending and of the subjective background of each of the offenders, cover a wide spectrum.  None are the same.  The only common element is that they were all suppliers of substantial quantities of prohibited drugs.  By focusing only on the quantity of drugs supplied, some of the sentences were imposed for amounts similar to those for which the applicant was sentenced.  The position of the various offenders in drug supply hierarchy, however, could either not be identified with precision or in some cases, was higher and in other cases lower than that occupied by the applicant.  To the extent that those cases and the cases on the schedule are capable of indicating a range of sentences, the sentence imposed in this case is not outside that range.
57There are, however, considerable limitations in relying upon a series of individual cases to establish some kind of range of sentences.  In that regard, the observations recently made by Adamson J (with whom Simpson and Davies JJ agreed) in Dang v R [2014] NSWCCA 47 are apposite:
""55 Care must be taken in drawing direct comparisons between sentences passed, those to be passed and those which are, or have been, the subject of appeal: see generally, Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2005] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [53]- [56] per French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ. Sentencing requires the exercise of discretion. The factors that are germane to the exercise of the discretion include deterrence, both general and specific, rehabilitation and punishment. The exercise of the discretion requires consideration of objective circumstances (the seriousness of the offending conduct) as well as subjective circumstances pertinent to the offender. The number of factors to be taken into account as either mitigating or aggravating under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides an indication of the complexity of the exercise and the concomitant difficulty of identifying ""comparable cases"".  Although it is orthodox for such cases to be identified for the benefit of the sentencing judge, they can be no more than a guide.""

58Perhaps the most significant difficulty faced by the applicant in making out this ground of appeal are the principles conveniently set out in Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 where Gleeson CJ and Hayne J said:
""5 ... Thus, as was accepted in argument in this Court, the appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal was based upon an allegation of manifest inadequacy rather than specific error. That is, the error assigned was of the third kind mentioned in House v The King. Only if this error was demonstrated was it open to the Court of Criminal Appeal to ""pass such other sentence warranted in law ... in substitution"" for the sentence passed at trial.
6 Manifest inadequacy of sentence, like manifest excess, is a conclusion. A sentence is, or is not, unreasonable or plainly unjust; inadequacy or excess is, or is not, plainly apparent. It is a conclusion which does not depend upon attribution of identified specific error in the reasoning of the sentencing judge and which frequently does not admit of amplification except by stating the respect in which the sentence is inadequate or excessive. It may be inadequate or excessive because the wrong type of sentence has been imposed (for example, custodial rather than non-custodial) or because the sentence imposed is manifestly too long or too short. But to identify the type of error amounts to no more than a statement of the conclusion that has been reached. ...""
59In the same case, Gaudron and Gummow JJ said:
""57 ...  In Lowndes v The Queen, this Court remarked that: 
""a court of criminal appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge merely because the appellate court would have exercised its discretion in a manner different from the manner in which the sentencing judge exercised his or her discretion. ... The discretion which the law commits to sentencing judges is of vital importance in the administration of our system of criminal justice.""
58 The necessity to show error in such a case is fully accepted by courts deciding appeals against sentence. Indeed, it is commonly referred to by the Court of Criminal Appeal of Western Australia. Because the imposition of a sentence involves the exercise of judgment and evaluation upon which minds can differ, it bears close similarities to the making of a discretionary decision.  Like such a decision, if properly imposed, a sentence will not be disturbed on appeal merely because the appellate court would have reached a different result had the responsibility of sentencing belonged to it.  As in the case of appellate review of a discretionary decision, a brake is imposed upon undue appellate disturbance of primary decisions (and unwarranted appeals seeking that relief) by the necessity to identify an error that justifies and authorises appellate intervention. Such an error may involve the adoption by the primary judge of an incorrect principle, giving weight to some extraneous or irrelevant matter, failing to give weight to some material considerations, or a mistake as to the facts.
59 As on appeal from discretionary decisions, it will sometimes not be possible to identify, with exactness, an error of the foregoing kind; yet the result that is challenged may be so manifestly unreasonable or plainly wrong that the appellate court will be able to infer that, in some unidentified way, there has been a failure to exercise the power properly. In appellate review of sentencing, it will commonly be the case that the appellate court's authority to intervene will derive from a conclusion that the resulting order is so disproportionate to the matter to which it relates as to afford the foundation for concluding that, in some way, the exercise of the powers of the primary judge has miscarried.""
60It has not been shown that the primary judge erred in the exercise of his wide sentencing discretion.  His finding was of a very serious case of drug dealing and that the role of the applicant was significant.  His conclusion was:
""In my view both offenders fall within the middle range of participation.  Because Pham appears to be closer to the ultimate supplier he might be regarded as having a more significant role, but the differences in their roles are not very great.""  
61While his Honour did not emphasise them, the principles of general deterrence and denunciation of substantial drug supply loom large in this matter.  His Honour gave appropriate weight to the applicant's subjective circumstances with particular reference to the difficulties likely to be encountered by his wife.  No challenge has been made to his findings in that regard.
62For this ground of appeal to succeed, it had to be established by the applicant that the sentences imposed were ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"".  That has not occurred.  The primary judge correctly identified the objective seriousness of the applicant's offending and the resulting sentences are not out of step with that finding.  I do not consider the sentence imposed to be outside the range within which the sentencing judge's discretion could be properly exercised.
63The orders which I propose are that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.
64ADAMS:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
65HALL J:  I agree with the orders proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL and with his Honour's reasons.

2705918,RajLaw NSW Pty Ltd v RajLaw Pty Ltd [2013] NSWSC 1621,"Judgment

1By Contract of Sale dated 6 July 2012 the plaintiff company purchased from the first defendant that part of its legal business as was carried on in New South Wales. The second defendant (Mr Raj) was the sole director of the first defendant. The purchase price was $1 million subject to variations. A sum of $600,000 was paid on completion as part of the ultimate purchase price. 

2The plaintiff company is a legal practice. Mr Bechara Shamieh is its sole director. Mr Raj was previously a director but in some way that appointment, according to the ASIC search in evidence, ceased on 12 September 2013. The shares in the plaintiff company are held by Consolidated Corporate Pty Limited. Consolidated Lawyers Pty Limited is another legal company. Mr Shamieh is one of four directors. He holds a majority of the shares. The other directors are Graham Fullick, Therese Armstrong and Ramy Qutami. Veritas Legal Pty Limited is a third New South Wales legal company. The directors of this are Mr Qutami, Ms Armstrong and Mr Shamieh. Maddison Marcus Law Firm Pty Limited is the fourth law firm involved on the plaintiff's side. It has the same directors as Veritas.

3The Contract omits to describe the business name of the business sold but lists the type of business sold as ""legal firm"". There are special conditions to the contract relevant to this interlocutory hearing:

45.1 The Vendor and Purchaser agree to the following post settlement collaboration:

...

(c) Will use their best endeavours to assist one another to grow their respective practices.


45.2 The parties may agree to the following post settlement collaboration:

...

(b) Referral of work and clients to one another. For example, the Vendor shall refer to the Purchaser all work falling within the New South Wales jurisdiction and the Purchaser shall refer to the Vendor all work falling within the Queensland, [sic] even if a client is a national client, that is, the services they require fall within the Queensland jurisdiction and the New South Wales jurisdiction.

(c) Notwithstanding Clause 45.2(b) the Purchaser agrees that the Vendor may continue to act for National clients that he currently acts for from his Queensland office as disclosed in Annexure ""B"" of this agreement.

...

46 Restraint

(a) Mr Raj warrants that for a period of seven-(7) years he will not carry on or be engaged in the practice of law in New South Wales (unless otherwise required by the Purchaser) nor will he contact the clients and/or referral partners for the purposes of soliciting that client and/or referral partner to cease dealing with the Purchaser to return to the Vendor company and/or any other company to which Mr Raj is associated or otherwise connected.

(b) The Purchaser acknowledges that this Special Condition does not restrain Mr Raj from practising as a Solicitor in another state / jurisdiction other than in the State of New South Wales.

(c) The parties acknowledge that this Special Condition shall not merge on completion.

(d) In addition, the Vendor, its directors, shareholders and related entities agree that it will not open or be involved in a business, that is similar to or competitive with the Purchaser within the State of New South Wales for a period of seven-(7) years.

(e) The Vendor and its directors, shareholders and any related entity agree not to do any act or thing which would cause or is likely to cause the clients to seek the transfer of their file to another firm. For the purposes of this clause related entity has the same meaning as prescribed in the Corporations Act (2001).

(f) The Vendor and its directors, shareholders, employees (to the extent possible) and related entities covenant that they shall not undertake, engage or carry out any work on behalf of clients relating to the Practice of Law in New South Wales, a client domiciled in New South Wales and work that would reasonably be expected to be carried out in New South Wales from any other state or jurisdiction, unless otherwise consented to by the Purchaser for a period of seven-(7) years from the Completion Date. This clause shall bear no effect on the Vendor with respect to clients domiciled in Queensland.

4There were discussions between Mr Raj and Mr Shamieh about an over- arching name for the Queensland and New South Wales businesses. The Queensland business after the sale continued to be operated by the first defendant. Mr Shamieh was in favour of Maddison Marcus. On the evidence as it stands Mr Raj did not agree to this. The Maddison Marcus website indicated that Consolidated Lawyers, Veritas Legal and Raj NSW Property Division were combined under the Maddison Marcus umbrella. Maddison Marcus has itself opened an office in Brisbane it seems consisting of Consolidated Lawyers and Veritas Legal but not Raj NSW. Members of the staff of Raj NSW have worked for Maddison Marcus clients from time to time but this does not really matter for the purpose of this interlocutory hearing.

5The third defendant, Arrow Law Pty Ltd (Arrow), was incorporated in July 2013. Mr Raj is one of two directors. A company, Astra Group Investments Pty Ltd, is a major shareholder. It is not clear whether Arrow has purchased the practice of the first defendant or whether there has been a transfer of business without purchase but Mr Raj is now practising as Arrow Law and is transferring the clients from the first defendant to the new firm.

6The substantive orders sought in the action are:

1. Declarations of breach by the first and second defendants of obligations under the restraint provisions of the contract for sale;

2. An order for specific performance of certain obligations the subject of the alleged breaches;

3. An order for final injunctions restraining breach of the restraint provisions and certain other provisions of the contract;

4. In addition, orders are sought restraining Arrow from carrying on any legal practice for 7 years, and an account of profits of the third defendant; and

5. Damages.

7This judgment deals with a claim for interlocutory relief. The principal orders sought are set out in prayers 20-25 and 27 of the Amended Summons as follows:

20. An order, until further order, restraining the Third defendant (whether by its servants or agents or otherwise howsoever) from carrying on, or being engaged in, legal practice.

21. An order, until further order, restraining the First and Second defendants (whether by its servants or agents or otherwise howsoever) from transferring the business of the first defendant to the third defendant.

22. An order, until further order, restraining the Second defendant (whether by its servants or agents or otherwise howsoever) from carrying on, or being engaged in, legal practice in a name other than 'Raj Lawyers' in Queensland and Victoria.

23. An order that the First defendant, Second defendant and Third defendant be restrained (whether by themselves, their servants or agents or otherwise howsoever), pending the final hearing of the proceedings, or further or earlier order, from:

a. carrying on, or being engaged in, any work for a client domiciled in New South Wales, or that involves the practice of law in New South Wales;

b. carrying on, or being engaged in, any work for a client domiciled outside of New South Wales that would reasonably be expected to be carried out in New South Wales.

24. Further and in the alternative, an order, until further order, under section 232/234 of the Australian Consumer Law restraining the Third defendant from aiding and abetting the contravention by the First and Second defendant of section 18 of the Australian Consumer Law by carrying on, or being engaged in, legal practice.

25. Further and in the alternative an order, until further order, under section 232/234 of the Australian Consumer Law restraining the First defendant from contravening section of 18 of the Australian Consumer Law by:

a. restraining the First defendant from transferring its business to the Third Defendant;

b. restraining the First defendant from carrying on, or being engaged in, any work for a client domiciled in New South Wales, or that involves the practice of law in New South Wales;

c. restraining the First defendant from carrying on, or being engaged in, any work for a client domiciled outside of New South Wales that would reasonably be expected to be carried out in New South Wales.

...

27. Further and in the alternative, an order, until further order, restraining the Third defendant from interfering with the Contract between the Plaintiff and the First defendant by carrying on, or being engaged in legal practice.


8There are additional claims under section 18 of Schedule 2 to the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) (the Australian Consumer Law) against the first and second defendant. These are really representation claims based upon the contractual obligations and claimed breaches of those obligations.

9It is accepted by the defendants for the purpose of this hearing that there is a reasonable question to be determined as to whether Mr Raj is a party to the contract. It is I think clear that Arrow, through Mr Raj, had knowledge of the contract for the sale of business so that in accepting as clients those who were previously clients of Raj Law Pty Ltd there is at least a seriously arguable case to be tried as to whether Arrow induced a breach of the contract between the plaintiff and the first defendant: OBG Ltd v Allan [2008] AC 1 at 39-41 per Lord Hoffman. There is also a question of whether or not Arrow was formed as a sham for the purpose of enabling the first and second defendants to evade their obligations under the contract: Albert Locke (1940) Ltd v Winsford Urban District Council (1973) 71 LGR 308 (Chancery Division).

10Whether the tort of causing loss by unlawful means has been committed is not presently to the point. The decision of the House of Lords in OBG Ltd v Allan [2008] AC 1 shows why DC Thomson & Co Ltd v Deakin [1952] Ch 646 is no longer good law in England. There was a statement by Williams JA in Deepcliff Pty Ltd v Gold Coast City Council (2001) 118 LGERA 117 at 139 that it is only for the High Court of Australia to decide whether a tort of causing loss by unlawful means exists in Australia, after that Court refused to decide that question in Sanders v Snell (1998) 196 CLR 329. 

11Whether or not that tort is part of the law in Australia, the tort of inducing breach of contract is: Short v City Bank of Sydney (1912) 15 CLR 148. To that extent, the reasoning of the House of Lords is open to be followed here. Commentators have said that it could be followed: R P Balkin and J L R Davis, Law of Torts (2013, 5th edn) at 610. Judges have cited Lord Hoffman's speech relating to inducing breach of contract with apparent approval: Wilson HTM Investment Group Ltd v Pagliaro (2012) 226 IR 75 at 96 per Bergin CJ in Eq; Cleary v Kocatekin [2012] NSWSC 692 at [18] per Bergin CJ in Eq; LED Technologies Pty Ltd v Roadvision Pty Ltd (2012) 199 FCR 204 at 215-216 per Besanko J. 

12As the first and second defendants are restrained under the contract from carrying on legal business in NSW for 7 years and there is an arguable case that Arrow was formed for the purpose of circumventing this and that Arrow has induced the first defendant to breach its contract with the plaintiff, I consider there is a serious question to be tried on those issues. The balance of convenience is clearly in favour of an interlocutory order restraining Arrow from carrying on legal business in New South Wales. I can see no basis for restraining Arrow from practising anywhere at all as is actually sought.

Prayer 21 of the Amended Summons
13The evidence indicates that the transfer has taken place. In that case there would be no point in the order sought. In addition the argument on this claim as addressed by Mr AW Street SC was based upon clause 46(e) of the contract which in my opinion deals with clients of the NSW firm. There is no suggestion or threat such clients have been or will be approached to transfer or will be somehow transferred to Arrow. I do not consider there is a proper question to be tried on this claim.

Prayer 22 of the Amended Summons
14This claim appears to be contrary to rights under clause 46(b) of the contract. Clause 46(e) does not appear to vary clause 46(b) rights. There is no doubt that Mr Raj is involved in the Arrow company but the claim for interlocutory relief was not based upon the agreement as to collaboration under clause 45 of the contract.

Prayer 23 of the Amended Summons
15There is no evidence that any work of the nature referred to is being carried on or that there is some threat that it will be. Matters identified related only to completion of leasing matters where the costs had already been paid. In addition, the nature of the restraints sought in prayer 23(b) is expressed in terms that lack clarity and certainty. I do not consider the court would make the order sought. This is because one cannot ordinarily direct injunctions at people who are not parties and because ""any work ... that would reasonably be expected to be carried out in New South Wales"" is so uncertain and open to debate as to its meaning that it could not form part of a court order. 

Prayer 24 of the Amended Summons
16As I have said I intend to make an order pursuant to the claim in prayer 21 on a more limited basis I would not make a wider order under paragraph 24.

Prayer 25 of the Amended Summons
17In respect of prayer 25 the same conclusions are reached as I have already reached on the earlier paragraphs dealing with the contractual claims.

18Other interlocutory orders sought in the Amended Summons were not addressed by counsel and were therefore not pressed and I do not deal with them. I should add that clauses 46(a) and (c) of the contract of sale cannot impose obligations on Arrow which is not a party to the contract. 

Result
19The result of this is that an order will be made in more limited terms than that sought in prayer 20. The balance of the claims for interlocutory relief will be dismissed. As each party has had some success and as the final result has not been determined it seems to me that the appropriate order for costs is that the costs of the interlocutory hearing be determined by the trial Judge.

20It is, I think, important that this matter be determined on a substantive basis as quickly as possible. It seems likely that a lot of the evidence required for final hearing has already been gathered. I will make directions to do this.

Orders
1. Upon the plaintiff through its counsel giving the usual undertaking as to damages, order up until the final determination of the action or any prior order the third defendant be restrained from carrying on or being engaged in legal practice in New South Wales.

2. Costs of the Notice of Motion be determined by the trial Judge.

Directions
3. Direct the matter proceed on pleadings and the plaintiff file a Statement of Claim by 12 November 2013.

4. Direct the plaintiff to file a Notice of Motion by 7 November 2013 returnable on 15 November 2013 seeking an expedited hearing.

2707197,Piscitelli v R [2013] NSWCCA 8,"Judgment

1Hoeben JA: I agree with Button J.

2Johnson J: I agree with Button J.

3Button J: On 14 February 2011 in the District Court at Wollongong, his Honour Judge Frearson SC sentenced Tony Dominic Piscitelli (""the applicant"") for four offences. Three appeared on an indictment and one was placed before his Honour on a certificate pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. All offences were of a sexual nature, and all of them arose from one incident on the evening of 13 April 2010.

4The details of the offences and the structure of the sentences imposed will be provided later in this judgment. It suffices to say at this stage that a total head sentence of imprisonment for 16 years 6 months with a total non-parole period of imprisonment for 11 years 6 months was imposed with regard to the four offences.

The offences

5The following summary is taken from the remarks on sentence. No ground of appeal impugns these findings of fact:

""Now the facts are that the victim, an eighty-three year old widow resided alone at her home at Tuross Boulevard, Tuross Heads and the victim's residence is a small two bedroom unit contained in a small complex of three units. Her unit is located at the front of the property facing the street. She lived at the address for some eight years. The victim suffered from asthma and takes various forms of Ventolin to relieve her condition. On Tuesday 13 April 2010 the victim spent the evening alone watching television in the lounge room of her unit which is situated at the front of the unit. The front screen door was locked. During the evening she changed into her sleeping attire, namely a nightie, dressing gown, underpants and socks. It was about 9pm that the victim left the lounge room with a torch and entered the bathroom at the rear of the unit to use the toilet. She used the torch apparently to save on electricity. She went to the bathroom in darkness and at the same time the accused entered the unit, the facts say by cutting the flyscreen. There is a dispute about the precise method of entry, and unlatching the screen door. The victim did not turn the light on in the bathroom and the only light in the unit at that time came from the torch and the single light which had been left on in the lounge room. As the victim seated herself on the toilet the offender, who unbeknown to her had entered the bathroom, placed a hand over her mouth and throat and applied pressure. The victim attempted to push the hand away from her mouth and throat at which time she heard the offender say, ""Don't make a noise, I'm not going to hurt you"". She attempted to struggle against the accused but was unable to free herself of his grasp and it was very dark and she could only see a body towering over her. The offender grabbed the victim by the upper left arm and pulled her off the toilet. The offender continued to say to the victim, ""I'm not going to hurt you, I'm not going to hurt you"".

The offender took the victim from the bathroom and pulled her towards the bedroom causing pain to her arm and during this time the victim pleaded with the accused saying, ""Please don't do this, please don't do this"". The offender pulled the victim into the bedroom, the room was in darkness and the offender said, ""Take the dressing gown off"". The victim was very scared and she complied. The accused said, ""Take your nightie off"", and the victim complied and the offender said, ""Take your pants off"", and she again complied. The victim did not argue and did fight against the offender but continued to plead with him stating, ""Please don't do this, please don't do this"". The offender ignored the victim's pleas and said, ""Lay on the bed on your stomach"". The victim did as she was told and the offender immediately attempted to penetrate her vagina with his penis without success and the victim actually felt the penis press against her anus. The offender made three or four attempts to penetrate the victim before inserting his fingers into her vagina and the accused moved his fingers around inside the victim's vagina and that is the activity that constitutes count 1.

After a short time the offender removed his fingers from the victim's vagina and he was breathing heavily at this time. The victim was struggling to breathe and she felt disgusted and humiliated as one would expect. The accused then said, ""Get up and lay on your back"", and the victim stood up from the bed and turned around before lying on her back on the bed with her knees on the bed and her legs dangling over the side. The offender penetrated the victim's vagina with his penis from a standing position and commenced to engage in penile/vaginal intercourse with her. That is the activity that founds count 2.

While this was occurring the offender placed his mouth on the victim's right breast, and this is the matter that is the indecent assault that founds the matter on the 166 certificate. The offender placed his face against her right cheek, the victim turned her head to the left in an attempt to move away from the offender and the offender stopped and said to the victim, ""I've got a knife"". She did not see a knife. He continued to have penile/vaginal sexual intercourse with the victim and the offender placed his arms around her in an embrace and demanded that she do the same. That seems rather odd. The victim, fearing for her life, did as the offender insisted. The offender became agitated and asked the victim if she was enjoying the sexual activity and the victim stated unsurprisingly, ""I'm 83 years old what do you expect"". The offender persisted in having penile/vaginal intercourse with the victim and ejaculated a short time later and the victim stated that the accused was pushing harder and faster prior to ejaculating causing her pain. She was struggling for breath and could feel her heart palpitating. The intercourse occurred for about three minutes.

The offender said, ""Stand up, sit down and put your back up against the wall"". The victim stood up from the bed and sat down on the floor in a small place between the dressing table and the bedroom door with her back against the brick wall. The offender forcefully took hold of the victim's head with both of his hands on either side of her face. He brought the victim's head forwards towards him and immediately forced it backwards causing the rear of her head to strike against an internal brick wall. He repeated this at least four or five times. This is the activity that is said to have resulted in the wounding that is the specially aggravating feature of the attempted sexual intercourse which I referred to before. The blows caused a loud cracking noise and the victim had tears in her eyes and felt intense pain. The offender stopped and the victim was able to get back onto the bed and she was having great difficult breathing and was suffering extreme pain to her head.

The offender was standing in front of her. She said, ""I need my puffer I can't breathe"", and the offender said, ""Where is your puffer"", and the victim replied, ""It's out on the kitchen table"", the offender said, ""I'll go and get it"", and he left the bedroom and the victim could see the silhouette of a tall thin man possibly wearing a checked shirt. The victim saw the offender turn towards the lounge room and took the opportunity to quickly replace her underpants, nightie and dressing gown. The victim then sat on the bed and waited for the accused to return with the puffer. He did not return. After a short time the victim left the bedroom and commenced to check all the rooms in her unit to determine whether the accused was still present. When she checked the laundry she saw that the back door was ajar. The victim closed and locked the door before entering the lounge room. The victim did not sight the offender and assumed him to have left the unit. She noticed that her puffer was where she had left it on the kitchen table. The victim sat in the lounge room and administered her puffer to assist her breathing. The victim saw that the front door to the premises was closed but not locked. She locked this door and returned to her chair. She feared calling the police and she was concerned the accused may still be nearby. About six to seven minutes after sitting in the chair the victim contacted a neighbour and the victim initially told the neighbour that there was an intruder in the home and she was in a mess. The neighbour contacted police with her husband and the neighbour and her husband attended the victim's unit. The victim was initially frightened to open the door when the neighbours arrived but ultimately she summoned the courage to let them in and they saw that the victim was covered in blood and she said, ""I've been raped"". One of the neighbours, Lynette Norton, called the police and ambulance and the victim was crying at this stage. Police and ambulance attended the victim's premises.""

6The profound gravity of the criminality encompassed by the offences committed by the applicant requires no elaboration by me. His Honour found that the offences were ""just below worst case"".

The aftermath of the offences

7As a result of the offences, the victim suffered extensive bruising to most of her body. There were also injuries to her genitals. There were a number of lacerations to various parts of her body, the most serious of which was a laceration to her right temple that required seven sutures. She remained in hospital for a period of 11 days. A number of black and white photos before this Court go some way to showing the injuries inflicted upon the victim. 

8A victim impact statement was read out in the proceedings on sentence. The victim described the impact of the offences upon her as ""huge"". She described flashbacks and memories that led her to ""shudder with revulsion"". She experienced nightmares and was being treated for depression as at the date of that statement. She was hypervigilant.

9The victim found it impossible to remain in the flat where the offences had been committed. She moved in with her daughter for three months and then with her son for two months. She found a new home away from Tuross Heads. She did not feel comfortable driving at her new home, and had lost a substantial degree of independence as a result.

10The victim revealed in the statement that, prior to the offences, the only person with whom she had had sexual contact in her life was her deceased husband.

11The victim impact statement concluded by saying that the victim believed on the evening in question that she would not survive her ordeal.

The position of the applicant after the offences

12A male DNA profile was obtained from the underwear of the victim. That profile was very promptly compared to a database, and it was found to be identical to the profile of the applicant on that database. The applicant was living in Tuross Heads at the time. On 19 April 2010 he was interviewed at length by the police, and flatly denied the offences. He was arrested and charged, and has been in custody ever since that date. 

13On 21 April 2010, his mother visited the applicant at the police station and asked him about the offences. His Honour found in the remarks on sentence that:

""[S]he asked him why he did it and according to the mother the offender replied, ""I don't know, I don't remember mum, I remember going to the house and seeing her watching TV, the door was open but the screen door was locked. I cut the flyscreen and reached in and unlocked the latch"". The offender stated, ""I don't think she saw me because it was dark"". He told his mother he could not remember anything else. On 22 April 2010 the accused's mother provided a statement to the police about those admissions.""

14In a further ERISP on 4 May 2010, the applicant did not deny the offences, but claimed to have no memory of them. He also claimed to have no memory of the conversation with his mother, or indeed of the first ERISP. With regard to his amnesia regarding the offences, he referred to the fact that he had been intoxicated that evening by alcohol, cannabis, and some prescription medication provided to him by another person. 

15The applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court and was committed for sentence (I infer that, for some procedural reason, an indictment was presented in the District Court). He received a 25 per cent discount as a result of the utilitarian value of his pleas. Neither party impugned the quantum of that discount in this Court. 

16Whilst in custody, the applicant wrote a letter to the victim expressing his embarrassment, shame, and remorse for what he had done. That letter was tendered in the proceedings on sentence. 

Subjective features generally

17No psychological, psychiatric, or pre-sentence report was available to his Honour in the proceedings on sentence. The applicant gave evidence on oath, as did his mother.

18The applicant was born on 10 July 1986. Accordingly, as at the date of the offence, he was 23 years old. As at the date of sentence, he was 24 years old.

19The applicant was raised by his mother on her own and had few, if any, positive male role models in his life. He was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder at the age of 9 years, and took medication for that condition until he was aged 15. He was exposed to illicit drugs at the age of 10. He had left school in year nine and had worked in a number of short-term, unskilled positions. At the time of these offences, he was unemployed and living with his mother in Tuross Heads. 

20There was no evidence of his level of intellectual functioning, but the impression one gains from the transcript of the ERISPs and his evidence on oath is that he is, at the least, an unsophisticated person.

21The criminal record of the applicant was not unblemished and did not assist him. It commences in the Children's Court with a charge when he was 12 years of age. It features offences of dishonesty, damage to property, and some violence, with resultant probation periods and short control orders, some suspended and some to be served in custody. As an adult in NSW, he had been convicted of malicious damage (for which he had been fined $100), and driving offences. 

22In Queensland, he had been dealt with as an adult for a number of offences relating to drug possession and use, misuse of a carriage service, and dishonesty. 

23His criminal record as a whole, whilst lengthy, revealed that the applicant had never been sentenced to imprisonment in an adult gaol. 

24Of particular note were two offences dealt with in the Children's Court in 2003. The facts with regard to each of those offences were tendered in the proceedings on sentence. The details of those two offences are as follows. 

25The applicant was dealt with for assaulting a school student in April 2003 whilst she was attending school. The facts were that an 8 year old girl entered the girls' toilet block of the public school she was attending. There she was grabbed around the mouth by the applicant. He told her to be quiet and said ""I have a friend here"". The victim escaped from the applicant, ran back to her class, and told her teacher what had happened. 

26The applicant was sentenced to a control order with a very short non-parole period. Of note was that one of the conditions of his release was that he was ""to participate in assessment and intervention as directed by the sex offender program"" and ""not to associate with children under the age of 12 years unless approved by the sex offender program"". 

27In August of the same year, the applicant committed an offence of peeping or prying. 

28The facts were that one morning a 16 year old girl went to use the female toilets at a TAFE in North Wollongong. There were two cubicles in the toilets, and the victim noted that one of the cubicles had its door closed. She went to the other cubicle, locked the door, and commenced to take off her jeans. At that time she heard a noise from the other cubicle, looked up, and saw the applicant looking at her over the top of the cubicle wall. She became frightened and ran out of the toilet. 

29For that offence, the applicant received a further control order with a non-parole period of 2 months. Again, included in the orders were the conditions that the applicant involve himself as directed with the sex offender program, and not associate with children under the age of 12 years unless authorised to do so. 

30The significance of these two matters will be discussed further below.

31It was shown in the proceedings on sentence that the applicant would serve any sentences on protection, though the evidence as to the degree of restriction resulting from that fact was quite limited.

32As for the future, both the applicant and his mother accepted that treatment for his undoubted sexual problems was essential.

33The findings of his Honour with regard to the future included that prospects of rehabilitation were ""extremely guarded"", and that there was a ""real danger that the offender will reoffend"". Those findings are not the subject of criticism by the applicant.

Two findings in the remarks on sentence

34Two factual findings made by his Honour found grounds of appeal in this Court.

35The first was with regard to the offence committed in April 2003 described above. There was a dispute at first instance as to whether his Honour could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that that offence had a sexual component. There was no dispute that the later offence of August 2003 could be so characterised. After reviewing the facts of the two matters, his Honour said in the remarks on sentence:

""These matters are relevant on the question of whether the offender has unresolved sexual issues and I will come back to that later. It is submitted on his behalf that the August 2003 incident [sic] does not have a sexual connotation. I am satisfied that it does and I am satisfied of that beyond reasonable doubt.""

36There was also a dispute at first instance whether one could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant intended to sexually assault the victim at the time when he entered the home, or whether his Honour should proceed on the basis that the applicant formed that intention sometime after entry. His Honour said:

""In relation to the facts I do find, and I find it beyond reasonable doubt, that the offender actually entered the premises with a view to the sexual exploitation of the victim. There is a close temporal connection between his entry into the premises and what he did and his evidence that he entered thinking something was wrong is inherently implausible and I find it unbelievable and I reject it beyond reasonable doubt.""

Sentences imposed

37Annexed to this judgment is a diagram that seeks to show the structure of the sentences imposed upon the applicant in a readily comprehensible format. 

38I shall discuss the sentences chronologically, in the sense that I deal with them in the order of their commencement dates.

39Count 3 was an offence of breaking and entering and committing a serious indictable offence (attempted sexual intercourse without consent) in circumstances of special aggravation, namely, wounding. The offence was brought pursuant to s 112(3) of the Crimes Act 1900. It was founded on the applicant opening the flyscreen door, entering into the dwelling of the victim, and thereafter unsuccessfully attempting to penetrate the genitalia of the victim with his penis. This offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years, and a standard non-parole period of imprisonment for 7 years. His Honour imposed a head sentence of 10 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 6 years 6 months, both to commence on 19 April 2010. The head sentence expires on 18 October 2020, and the non-parole period expires on 18 October 2016.

40There was an indecent assault contained on the s 166 certificate. It was founded on the touching of the breast of the victim. The offence was brought pursuant to s 61L of the Crimes Act. The maximum penalty for that offence when dealt with on indictment is imprisonment for 5 years. There is no standard non-parole period applicable. When dealt with summarily, the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 2 years. 

41His Honour imposed a fixed term of imprisonment for 2 years, to commence on 19 April 2010 and expire on 18 April 2012. It can be seen that that fixed term is completely concurrent with the sentence imposed on count 3. No challenge was made to this sentence, and it need not be discussed further. 

42Count 1 was an offence of aggravated sexual intercourse, the circumstance of aggravation being the infliction of actual bodily harm. The form of sexual intercourse relied upon to found this count was penetration of the vagina of the victim by the fingers of the applicant. The offence was brought pursuant to s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act. The maximum penalty was imprisonment for a period of 20 years, with a standard non-parole period of imprisonment for 10 years. His Honour imposed a head sentence of imprisonment for 12 years, to commence on 19 October 2011 and expire on 18 October 2023. A non-parole period of imprisonment for 7 years 6 months was imposed, to commence on 19 October 2011 and expire on 18 April 2019. 

43Count 2 was in identical terms. The form of sexual intercourse underpinning this count was penetration of the vagina of the victim by the penis of the applicant. A head sentence of imprisonment for 13 years to commence on 19 October 2013 and expire on 18 October 2026 was imposed, with a non-parole period of imprisonment for 8 years to commence on 19 October 2013 and expire on 18 October 2021.

44As noted above, the ultimate result is a total head sentence of imprisonment for 16 years 6 months, with a total non-parole period of 11 years 6 months. 

GROUNDS

45Six grounds of appeal have been notified. I shall deal with them in turn. 

Ground One
""The learned sentencing judge failed to give appropriate weight to the applicant's contrition""

Background and submissions

46No written or oral submissions were made by senior counsel for the applicant in support of this ground. 

47The background is that, in the remarks on sentence, his Honour said:

""On the question of remorse I accept that the offender has acknowledged the gravity of his behaviour and I do accept that he is remorseful and I do accept that he has accepted responsibility for his behaviour. And I do accept that he is ashamed of his behaviour.""

Decision

48In light of the position of senior counsel for the applicant, I consider that I can deal with this ground briefly. 

49In light of that extract from the remarks on sentence, it is not possible to say that his Honour failed to take into account this topic, or made a wrong finding about it, or even an ungenerous finding about it. As for whether his Honour gave the matter appropriate weight, that surely calls for evaluation of the ultimate sentences, both individually and in their total effect: see my remarks in Hanania v R [2012] NSWCCA 220, with whom Hoeben JA and Johnson J agreed. I proceed to consider the question of whether the sentences appropriately reflect the contrition that was found to exist when I come to ground six. 

50Accordingly, I do not uphold ground one as a separate ground.

Ground Two
""The learned sentencing judge fell into error in his treatment of the applicant's criminal history""

Background and submissions

51Senior counsel for the applicant submitted that it was not reasonably open to find that the offence in April 2003 (that is, the offence of assaulting the 8 year old girl in the toilet block by placing his hand over her mouth and holding her) had a sexual component. It was submitted that that finding was of some importance, because it played a role in the proposition that the applicant had longstanding sexual problems and that, as a result, his prospects of rehabilitation were extremely guarded. Senior counsel for the applicant referred to the portion of the remarks on sentence extracted by me above at [35], and submitted that there must have been some confusion about the topic. That was because defence counsel at first instance had never submitted that the incident in August 2003 did not have a sexual flavour. Rather, it was the characterisation of the earlier offence in April 2003 that was the point of contention in the Court below.

52Counsel for the respondent submitted that the reference to August, as opposed to April, in the extracted portion of the remarks on sentence was nothing more than a slip of the tongue. 

53As for whether it was reasonably open to find that the offence in April 2003 had a sexual connotation, she made a number of submissions. First, all three victims were females. Secondly, the applicant accepted in the witness box that, in 2003, his problem with females had manifested itself. Thirdly, he also gave evidence that he had realised in that same year that he had issues relating to violence with females. Fourthly, the criminal record of the applicant revealed that, with regard to the April 2003 offence, he had been ordered to be involved in a sex offender program. Fifthly and finally, she emphasised that all three offences were committed in toilets, two public and one private.

Decision

54The limitations on review by this Court of findings fact made by a sentencing judge at first instance are well known and established by such cases as R v O'Donoghue (1988) 34 A Crim R 397, R v Kelly (1993) 30 NSWLR 64, and Aoun v R [2011] NSWCCA 284. In short, a finding of fact will not found the basis of a successful ground unless that finding was ""not reasonably open"". 

55In light of all of the aspects of the evidence discussed above, I consider that the finding of fact under consideration was certainly reasonably open. 

56It follows that I would not uphold ground two. 

Ground Three
""The learned sentencing judge erred in reaching a conclusion, beyond reasonable doubt, that the applicant actually entered the premises with a view to the sexual exploitation of the victim.""

Background and submissions

57In support of this ground, senior counsel for the applicant conceded that the acceptance by his Honour of the version given by the mother of the applicant of the conversation at the police station was open. However, in light of what the applicant said in that conversation, and having regard to all of the evidence, including what the applicant had said on oath, it was submitted that one could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, at the time he entered the home of the victim, the applicant had formed the intention of sexually assaulting the victim.

58Counsel for the respondent made a number of submissions in support of the proposition that the finding was reasonably open. First, the reason for entry given by the applicant to the effect that he thought something was wrong was spurious and liable to prompt rejection. Secondly, the victim was unaware of the presence of the applicant in her home at any stage prior to the commencement of the offences. Thirdly, the applicant left immediately after the conclusion of the offences. Fourthly, the applicant committed no other offences (such as stealing) whilst in the home of the victim. 

Decision

59I need not repeat the limited basis upon which factual findings of sentencing judges may be overturned by this Court. 

60To the factors identified by counsel for the respondent may be added that, in light of the untruths in the first ERISP, and repeated subsequent changes of the position of the applicant, his credibility by the time he gave evidence in the witness box was very substantially damaged.

61Again, I consider that it was well open to his Honour to make the finding under consideration. Accordingly, I would not uphold ground three.

Ground Four
""The sentencing judge placed undue weight on the objective circumstances of the offences.""

Background and submissions

62This ground as developed focussed on some of the words used by his Honour in the remarks on sentence. Particular reliance was placed on the following portions at pp 8, 15-16:

""One only has to read those facts out to be horrified and it is a fact that any right thinking member of the community would be thoroughly disgusted by the facts of this case.

...

...I have also noted in particular the photographs depicting the injuries to the victim and I must say the photographs on any view are disturbing. ... [I]t does seem to me that the injuries sustained by the victim go far beyond the threshold of what is necessary to constitute the particular offences.

...

I have had regard to the Victim Impact Statement and that was a statement read by the victim's granddaughter and I must say when it was read out I think that nobody who heard it could have been unaffected by it. It was extremely disturbing to hear how an eighty-three year old woman was traumatised by these offences and very disturbing indeed ... It seems to me looking at the matter this was a savage, callous and predatory attack upon an eighty-three year old in her own home ... The offender's conduct towards the victim was particularly degrading and he entered the premises for the very purpose of engaging in that conduct and sexually exploiting the frail woman of advanced years."" 

63Attention was drawn by senior counsel for the applicant to the fact that his Honour found that the offences were ""just below worst case category"".

64It was also mentioned that his Honour had said of the offences ""these are very serious offences that attract standard non-parole periods"". As for that portion of the remarks on sentence, it was submitted that, to the extent that there had been pleas of guilty in the matters, his Honour was not correct in stating that the offences attracted standard non-parole periods. 

65As I understand this ground, the complaint is that, with regard to the first two paragraphs extracted from the remarks on sentence, the language used by his Honour was intemperate and suggestive that, to quote the oral submissions:

""it indicates an undue weight, in the overall circumstances, on the objective circumstances"".

66Counsel for the respondent submitted that strong language was called for by the offences. She noted that the applicant himself, in denying the offences in the first ERISP, referred to the allegations as ""disgusting"". He used the same word in the witness box to describe the actions that by that stage he did not deny. 

Decision

67The submission discussed at [64] may be disposed of quickly. The offences indeed attracted standard non-parole periods by way of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999; the law at that time was that, because of the pleas of guilty, the sentencing did not call for their inflexible application. In any event, the whole flavour of the remarks on sentence demonstrates that his Honour was quite aware of the role of a standard non-parole period when there had been a plea of guilty. Finally, there is no substantial ground asserting error in the approach to the standard non-parole periods. I respectfully reject this submission. 

68As for the language used by his Honour, it is noteworthy that, in his own letter of apology tendered in the proceedings on sentence, the applicant himself referred to the ""terrible way I treated you"" and the ""pain and trauma"" and ""suffering"" of the victim. Furthermore, in oral submissions in this Court in support of this very ground, senior counsel for the applicant referred to ""the horror of what, undoubtedly, was a horrendous sequence of circumstances"". Those characterisations adopted by the applicant himself and his own counsel lend support to the proposition that the language used by his Honour cannot be the subject of effective complaint on his behalf.

69The general purpose of remarks on sentence is to explain to the offender and to the community what sentence is being imposed and why. There is no requirement that remarks on sentence be anodyne or mealy-mouthed. If an offence is trivial, or comically inept, a sentencing judge is surely entitled to say so in the remarks on sentence. Conversely, where, as here, a series of offences is so serious as to inspire severe condemnation, I do not consider that a sentencing judge should be prohibited from using strong, even powerful, language, although it should never become inflamed or inflammatory. A similar approach to the use of powerful language in appropriate circumstances in remarks on sentence was taken by this Court in the recent decision of Lobsey v R [2012] NSWCCA 239 at [20] - [21].

70In this case, every member of the Australian community would surely deplore the ordeal to which the applicant subjected an 83 year old woman in her own home. In describing what the applicant did to the victim that evening, one could expect such citizens to use language far more potent than the language used by his Honour. 

71I do not consider that the language used by his Honour establishes an intemperate failure to approach the sentencing exercise properly, or a misjudgment as to the objective seriousness of the offences committed.

72It follows that I would not uphold ground four.

Ground Five
""With respect to count 2 the sentencing judge erred in commencing the sentencing process as if the offence fell into the worst category.""

Background and submissions 

73This ground was not the subject of written or oral submissions by senior counsel for the applicant. Nor was it addressed in writing by counsel for the respondent.

74Accordingly, I consider that I should deal with it very briefly.

Decision

75As I understand the ground, unilluminated by submissions, it seems to be suggesting that, if one subtracts the discount that resulted in a head sentence of imprisonment for 13 years on count 2, one arrives at a starting point head sentence of 17 years 4 months. That is approaching the maximum penalty of imprisonment available of 20 years. In light of that position, the ground seems to be asserting that that starting point head sentence is not consistent with the finding of his Honour that the offences were just below the worst case. 

76In truth, therefore, ground five appears to be asserting that the head sentence imposed for count 2 is erroneously long. Accordingly, I shall deal with this particular argument when I come to consider ground six.

77I would not uphold ground five as a separate ground. 

Ground Six
""The effective sentences imposed are manifestly excessive.""

Background and submissions

78In written submissions, senior counsel for the applicant suggested that ""the effect of the partial accumulation was such as to produce an overall sentence which is manifestly excessive"". He invited attention to two decisions of this Court, both of which I will analyse shortly. 

79Senior counsel for the applicant submitted that, if this ground were made out, this Court ""ought to intervene and proceed to re-sentence an effective reduction in line with a disposition of the appeal"" as to the total sentence in one of those decisions. 

80Counsel for the respondent submitted that the degree of partial accumulation exhibited in this sentencing structure was open to the discretion of his Honour. She also submitted that the criminality encompassed by the offences called for condign punishment. She also referred to the very well-known principle to the effect that, in order to succeed in such a ground, an applicant must demonstrate not merely a severe sentence, but a sentence that is ""plainly unreasonable or unjust"": Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357.

Decision

81The applicant was sentenced for one explosion of criminality committed against one victim. No offence carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life. The offences of the applicant did not include homicide. He pleaded guilty at an early stage and was remorseful. He was 23 years old at the time of the offences. His criminal record, although lengthy, contained nothing approaching the seriousness of these offences; indeed, he had never been sentenced to imprisonment in a gaol before. In those circumstances, the imposition of a total head sentence of 16 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 11 years 6 months calls for careful consideration of this ground. 

82I shall first consider the sentences individually, then totality, and then the total sentence in itself.

83Again, I will deal with the sentences in the chronological order in which they appear in the sentence structure. All offences, it will be recalled, are the subject of the undisputed characterisation by his Honour that they were ""just below worst case"".

84It will be recalled that count 3 featured a head sentence of imprisonment of 10 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 6 years 6 months, in the context of a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years and a standard non-parole period of 7 years. The offence reflected the breaking and entering of the victim's house and the attempted penetration of the vagina of the victim with the penis of the applicant. That was attempted three or four times, and the victim felt the penis of the applicant press against her anus. The wounding was the circumstance of special aggravation. It will be recalled that the wounding was occasioned by way of the repeated bashing of the head of an elderly woman against a wall. Despite her request for her asthma inhaler, the applicant thereafter departed, leaving the victim bruised, bleeding, in great pain and struggling for breath.

85Taking everything into account, including of course the subjective features, I do not consider that sentence to be manifestly excessive.

86As for the sentence for count 1, it will be recalled that it consists of a head sentence of imprisonment for 12 years with a non-parole of imprisonment for 7 years 6 months. It was imposed in the context of a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years with a standard non-parole period of imprisonment for 10 years. It featured the digital penetration of the vagina of the victim in the context of the infliction of a very substantial amount of actual bodily harm.

87I do not consider that the sentence is manifestly excessive.

88As for count 2, it will be recalled that a head sentence of imprisonment for 13 years with a non-parole period of imprisonment for 8 years was imposed. That was in the context of a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years with a standard non-parole period of 10 years. 

89The sexual intercourse that founded the offence was penetration of the vagina by the penis of the applicant. It lasted for about 3 minutes. During the course of it, the applicant threatened the victim by way of claiming to have a knife (though his Honour was not satisfied that that was in fact the case). During the intercourse the victim was in pain, could feel her heart palpitating, and was struggling for breath. The applicant ejaculated inside her. The degradation of the victim was made more pronounced by the enquiry by the applicant as to whether she was enjoying the experience.

90As I have indicated with regard to this ground of appeal, I give consideration to the aspect that I understand is encapsulated in ground five. The head sentence is imprisonment for 13 years. Accordingly, when one adds on the discount for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty, the starting point, reflecting all the objective and subjective features of the matter, must have been 17 years 4 months. The maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years. The finding of his Honour was that the offence was just below the worst class of case. Those circumstances give rise to the question as to whether the starting point was too high.

91Two things may be said with regard to that. The first is that this Court has cautioned against an analysis of starting points in order to determine whether a sentence is manifestly excessive: see SZ v R [2007] NSWCCA 19; (2007) 168 A Crim R 249 at [40], Rutkowsky v R [2008] NSWCCA 10 at [10] and Yousef v R [2011] NSWCCA 104 at [30]. Instead, attention should be focussed upon the sentence actually imposed.

92But even proceeding to undertake the analysis about which caution has been expressed, I come to the conclusion that the starting point is indeed approaching the maximum penalty but not inappropriately so, in all of the circumstances of this case. 

93Considering the sentence as a whole, and leaving aside the analysis based on starting points, I do not consider that the sentence is manifestly excessive. 

94In short, I do not determine that any individual sentence is manifestly excessive.

95I now consider the question of totality, reflected by the sentence structure adopted by his Honour. I proceed from the foundational proposition that a degree of partial accumulation was undoubtedly open to the discretion of his Honour; the question is whether the extent of the accumulation in this case has resulted in a total head sentence or total non-parole period that is manifestly excessive.

96Turning to the details of the sentencing structure, it can be seen that relatively short periods of custody are solely referable to the offences other than count 2.

97The structure is that the period actually to be served in custody for count 3 is 18 months. The s 166 offence is wholly concurrent with count 3. The period actually to be served in custody with regard to count 1 is 2 years. None of those aspects of the structure can be impugned by the applicant. 

98The head sentence and non-parole period of count 2 are wholly cumulative on those two periods actually to be served. But they are, of course, substantially concurrent with the head sentences of both count 3 and count 1. 

99I do not consider that those periods of accumulation can found a finding that error is established. It follows that I would not uphold the ground on the basis of an erroneous failure to reflect the principle of totality. 

100I turn to the question of whether the total head sentence and total non-parole period are manifestly excessive. This was the focus of the oral and written submissions of senior counsel for the applicant. In particular he invited attention to two decisions of this Court: Brooks v R [2006] NSWCCA 169 and AA v R [2009] NSWCCA 109. Senior counsel did not provide this Court with any other materials, such as statistics, tables of cases at first instance or on appeal, case summaries, or further decisions of this Court, in support of this ground. 

101In Brooks v R, the offender pleaded guilty to a number of offences. They were an offence of aggravated break and enter and committing an indictable offence, namely, aggravated sexual intercourse without consent; aggravated sexual intercourse without consent; attempted aggravated sexual intercourse without consent; a further offence of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent; and aggravated robbery. Each offence carried a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 20 years. For the aggravated break and enter offence there was a standard non-parole period of 5 years, and for the aggravated sexual assaults there was a standard non-parole period of 10 years. There were also offences on a Form 1.

102Briefly, the offender broke into the home of an 82 year old woman. He terrified her with a spanner. He penetrated her vagina digitally and with his penis. It is not clear whether the offender ejaculated. He also performed cunnilingus and attempted to force the victim to perform fellatio. The offender robbed the victim. It was found by the sentencing judge that the initial intention was to steal, not to sexually assault.

103The offender in that matter was aged 18 years at the time of the offences. He was on parole, and another sentence had expired only days before. He had a bad criminal record. He had been sexually assaulted as a child. His older brother had committed suicide. The offender in that case was not remorseful. His sentence was to be served on protection. A discount of 20 per cent was applied for the utilitarian value of pleas of guilty. At first instance an total head sentence of imprisonment for 17 years was imposed with an total non-parole period of imprisonment for 13 years.

104On appeal, a ground founded on the characterisation by the sentencing judge at first instance that the offences fell into the worst class of case was upheld. The aggregate sentence was reduced, with the result that there was a total head sentence of imprisonment for 14 years with a total non-parole period of 10 years 6 months. That was the result for which senior counsel for the applicant contended in this appeal in his written submissions.

105In some ways, the position of the applicant was more favourable than that of Brooks. In the case of the applicant, there was no robbery; there was no use of a weapon (although there was the threat thereof); the applicant had a less serious criminal record; there was a finding of remorse; and there was (one can assume from the discount given to Brooks) an earlier plea of guilty.

106In other ways, the position of the applicant was less favourable than that of Brooks. The applicant was aged 23, as opposed to 18, as at the date of the offences; he committed an offence carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years; he inflicted severe physical violence upon the victim above and beyond the violence inherent in the sexual offences; he intended to commit sexual offences at the time of entry, as opposed to opportunistically forming that intention later; his subjective features were less compelling; and there were prior offences that were found to have a sexual flavour.

107The exercise of comparing and contrasting the matter under consideration with the appeal in Brooks v R, with particular regard to the total head sentence and total non-parole period imposed on Brooks, does not persuade me that the total head sentence and non-parole period imposed upon the applicant are manifestly excessive.

108In AA v R, the offender detained and sexually assaulted a 32 year old woman in her car. There were two offences of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent, the circumstance of aggravation being the use of a knife to threaten to inflict actual bodily harm. Each of those offences carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years with a standard non-parole period of 10 years. There was also an offence of armed carjacking. That offence carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years and a standard non-parole period of 5 years. There was also an offence of detaining with intent to obtain an advantage, which carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years. 

109A knife was used to effect the offences, and at times it was held firmly to the throat of the victim. There was digital penetration of the vagina of the victim, and penile penetration with ejaculation. It was found that, at the time he entered the vehicle, the offender intended to commit sexual offences.

110When he departed, the offender implicitly threatened the victim with death if she informed the authorities of his offences. 

111The offender in AA v R was not yet 17 at the time of the offences. He entered an early plea of guilty, after having been served with DNA evidence. He had a bad record, including a previous matter of sexual intercourse without consent. His childhood had been marred by domestic violence and, at the age of 4, seeing his father commit suicide by way of a shotgun blast to the head. He suffered from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and had low cognitive function. He was not found to be remorseful, on the basis that his level of functioning did not permit him to fully appreciate the gravity of what he had done. 

112A ground founded upon the proposition that the total head sentence of imprisonment for 13 years with a total non-parole period of imprisonment for 9 years was manifestly excessive did not find favour in this Court. 

113Again, in some ways the position of the applicant was more favourable than the position of AA. The applicant used no weapon; there was no threat of death; and the applicant had a less serious record. In other ways, the position of the applicant was worse: the applicant was substantially older than AA; the subjective circumstances of the applicant were less compelling; the victim of the applicant was more vulnerable; the offences were committed in the home of the victim; and finally, severe violence was visited upon an elderly and frail woman.

114Again, comparing of all of the salient aspects of the matter under consideration with the judgment in AA v R, and focussing in particular on the total head sentence and total non-parole period, I do not come to the conclusion that the total head sentence and aggregate non-parole period imposed in this matter are manifestly excessive. 

115Speaking generally, it is not easy for this Court to seek to construe whether a sentence is manifestly excessive by comparison to one or two other cases that bear some objective or subjective similarities to the matter under appeal: see R v George [2004] NSWCCA 247; (2004) 149 A Crim R 38. All cases turn on their own facts, and, as in the examples discussed here, there will be factors that point towards or away from a greater or lesser sentence. What needs to be shown by an applicant with regard to this ground is that the sentence is so far outside the range available to the discretion of the sentencing judge as to be clearly wrong. It is not easy for this Court to be satisfied of such a proposition on the basis of two other cases. 

116Finally, although counsel for the respondent submitted that it was not appropriate, I consider that it is useful, in evaluating whether the total head sentence and non-parole period are manifestly excessive, to consider what the total head sentence and total non-parole period would have been if there had been a trial. That cannot be worked out mathematically, because the starting point reflects the finding of remorse, which would almost certainly have been absent if a trial had taken place. Nevertheless, if there had been a trial, I consider that it is useful to reflect on a total head sentence in the order of 22 years with a total non-parole period in the order of 15 years 6 months. Would such sentences have been appropriate in the circumstances? Apart from anything else, such a trial would have involved an 84 year old witness re-living the events of that evening. 

117A hypothetical total sentence of that length would undoubtedly have been a heavy one. But the criminality to which it would have related was extreme. And the fact is that this Court does not shy away from the imposition of very lengthy sentences for offences of sexual violence of great brutality: see Haines v R [2012] NSWCCA 238. Ultimately, I am not satisfied that such a hypothetical sentence demonstrates that the total head sentence or total non-parole period actually imposed in this case is manifestly excessive.

118In short, I am not persuaded that any individual sentence is manifestly excessive; or that totality is erroneously reflected in the sentence structure; or that the total head sentence or total non-parole period actually imposed is manifestly excessive, whether by way of the comparisons with two other cases that senior counsel for the applicant invited this Court to undertake, or by way of consideration of the ""starting point"". 

119It follows that I would not uphold ground six.

		04 February 2013",2013-02-03 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2708434,Regina v PL [2012] NSWCCA 31,"Judgment

1BATHURST CJ: This is an appeal brought by the Crown pursuant to s 107 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (""the Act"") against the directed verdict of acquittal given following the conclusion of the Crown case on the trial of the respondent for the manslaughter of MG (""the deceased"").

2Prior to the trial the subject of the appeal, the respondent had stood trial for both the murder and the manslaughter of the deceased. The trial judge in that trial directed a verdict of acquittal. On appeal the verdict was quashed and a new trial ordered on the charge of manslaughter. It is from the directed verdict in that second trial that this appeal is brought.

The grounds of appeal

3The Crown relies on two grounds:

1 His Honour erred by misdirecting himself on the test of whether there is a case to answer.

2 His Honour erred in finding that it was ""usually necessary"" for the Crown, in order to establish that there was a case to answer, to identify ""the cause of death or the precise acts that resulted in that cause"" of death.

4Each of the parties accepted that an appeal under s 107 of the Act must involve a question of law alone (see s 107(2)) and that the section does not permit an appeal on a mixed question of fact and law: R v PL [2010] NSWCCA 256; (2010) 261 ALR 365 at [11]-[27].

The factual background

5The factual background set out below is taken from the judgment of the trial judge setting out the reasons for his directed verdict and the summary of trial filed by the Crown in this appeal which is accepted as correct by the respondent.

6The respondent and the deceased, MG, had been in a relationship for some years. However, there was evidence that the deceased was contemplating bringing it to an end. A friend of the deceased and respondent ('the friend') gave evidence that about a month before his death, the deceased told him that he wanted to terminate his relationship with the respondent because he was not happy, the respondent was becoming aggressive and he (the deceased) was frightened of him.

7A neighbour lived in a terrace adjoining the one occupied by the deceased and the respondent. At about 8.15am on the morning of 7 April she heard a bang, ""sounding like a shelf falling, and pots and lids falling to the ground"". She then heard what she described as a sound or singing lasting ""for 8 seconds even"". She later said, ""It could have been a word even, if it was muffled, it was - I didn't know what it was - it was a shout or a roar. It could have been somebody saying something or crying out"".

8She gave evidence that at about 8.45am she heard some further noise from the adjoining premises. She said she could hear ""somebody crying like a child, having a temper tantrum crying that type of cry, you know, not really crying. It was like roaring or having a tantrum"". She said it was the respondent who was crying but she could not identify the persons she had heard shouting earlier. She said the respondent's crying or wailing continued for about 10 to 20 minutes. 

9On the morning of 7 April 2007, the wife of the friend of the deceased and respondent telephoned their residence at around 9.00am. The person who answered the telephone, believed by her to be the respondent, was crying on the end of the line sounding really upset and hysterical. She then rang her husband and daughter and told them to go to the house.

10At 9.12am on 7 April, the respondent made a 000 phone call. The transcript of the call records him saying, ""I have a fight with my friend"". The operator is recorded saying, ""I beg your pardon?"" and the respondent is recorded replying, ""I have a fight with my friend and my friend dead"". 

11The friend gave evidence that after receiving a call from his wife he went to the house in which the deceased and the respondent were residing. He could see the respondent ""scream his head off"" sitting with the deceased's body. He remembered the respondent saying, ""I want my [MG], [MG], wake up, [MG]"". 

12The ambulance officer, a Mr Lawrence Agars, attended the house and saw the respondent sitting at the bottom of the staircase with his back to the front door, the deceased lying on his back with his head elevated on a pillow in the respondent's lap. He said the respondent was hysterical and he was wailing very loudly. Officer Agars said there was what appeared to be a tiny smear of blood on the wall of the stairs but he was unsure if he put it there with his gloves. He also noted a metal object, a small pot with a spout, near the deceased's legs.

13The police officers who arrived soon after observed that the respondent had what appeared to be blood on the top that he was wearing at the time.

14After the respondent had been handcuffed and cautioned, he was heard saying to Senior Constable Simkins, ""It's too late. I need my medication"". Senior Constable Simpkins asked what had happened that morning and he replied, ""He had a fight"". He was asked what the fight was about but he only replied, ""I want my medication"".

15A Mr Raymond Carter, a former partner of the respondent and also a friend of the deceased, attended Redfern Police Station. He saw the respondent was crying and hysterical. After a time the respondent told him, ""We had an argument"" and ""I was making carrot juice. [MG] kept at me"" and then started sobbing even more.

16At 3.30pm on the afternoon of 7 April, Detective Hamill cautioned the respondent. The respondent said, ""No I didn't murder him, he's not dead he is only in hospital"". Detective Hamill said, ""No [MG] is dead. Can you tell me what happened?"". The respondent replied, ""I don't remember. We have breakfast, [MG] argue with me. He criticise me a lot"". The respondent then said, ""Oh, [PL]"" (himself) and then ""Then my head starts spinning. Then I don't know what happened"".

17A Detective Griffin attended the premises on 7 April 2007. He noticed what appeared to be a bloodstain on the northern wall near the deceased and an apparent smudge of blood on the doorway and handrail of the stairs. There was an apparent bloodstain smeared on the part of the juicer on the floor near the deceased, but no blood on the floor. No scientific testing was done to determine whether what Detective Griffin saw was in fact blood.

18Dr Paull Botterill was the forensic pathologist who conducted the autopsy on the deceased. In his opinion the cause of death was blunt force head and neck injuries. Both head and neck injuries would be possible causes of death. Whilst either could have resulted in death, it was more likely that the combination of them was responsible for the death. Dr Botterill noticed the following injuries at the autopsy:

1 Tears over the skin of the right side of the chin.

2 Tears, grazes and bruises under the chin.

3 Multiple tears to the skin and bruises over the front of the neck and upper front of the chest.

4 Bruising beneath the skin at the back of both sides of the head.

5 A tear of the lining of the inside of the mouth near the right lower lip.

6 Some blood over the surface of the brain.

7 Bruises to the left back and hip region, and 

8 Multiple bruises under the skin of the right arm, left forearm, right wrist and knuckles of both hands.

19Dr Botterill stated that although any of the individual injuries might have been associated with a simple fall, the extent and distribution of the injuries was more in keeping with multiple, blunt force contacts. A fall down the stairs may have accounted for some of the injuries but not all of them. He stated it was possible that the cross-type laceration to the deceased's chin was caused by contact with the metal part of the juice extractor. He agreed, in answer to questioning from the trial judge, that in relation to the neck injuries it was difficult to be more accurate than that they had occurred within a 24 hour period before death. However, he stated that if one knew the neck injuries had been inflicted six or eight hours before death, he would defer to the head injuries as the cause of death.

20Dr Botterill inspected the area around the staircase in the house. In his opinion a fall from the landing partway up the staircase could not result in the constellation of injuries on the deceased. He could not conceive of the deceased's injuries being caused by a fall from the top of the stairs, except for the ""theoretical possibility"" of a person having a seizure and repeatedly moving their body along a surface to produce the pattern of bruising on the chest, but he had never seen such in a situation in his experience. 

21Dr Michael Rodriguez was the neuropathologist who examined the deceased's brain at the request of Dr Botterill. His principal diagnosis was that the brain was subjected to blunt force injury. He said that there was a significant movement of the central structures of the brain and the injury to the central part of the brain was by far the most serious of the deceased's brain injuries. He stated possible causes could include:

(a) A fall down six steps of a set of stairs.

(b) If one was hit hard enough over the head with the part of the juice extractor.

(c) If a person was in a physical altercation, was pushed backwards and fell and hit his head on a wooden floor.

The reasoning of the trial judge

22Early on in his judgment the trial judge stated the test to be applied in determining whether or not to direct a verdict of acquittal. He referred to the principle as stated in Doney v The Queen [1990] HCA 51; (1990) 171 CLR 207 at 212 to the following effect:

""There is no doubt that it is a trial judge's duty to direct ... [a verdict of not guilty] if the evidence cannot sustain a guilty verdict or, as is commonly said, if there is no evidence upon which a jury could convict.""

23His Honour accepted that ""evidence which favours the accused as, for example, by contradicting, qualifying, or explaining the evidence supporting a conviction is to be disregarded: R v R (1989) 18 NSWLR 74"", and that questions of credibility and reliability are for the jury to determine, not the judge. He stated the mere fact that in a circumstantial case it is possible to formulate a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence which the prosecution has failed to exclude cannot justify a direction that the jury should acquit if there is evidence upon which the accused could be convicted.

24The parties accepted that in this part of his judgment (pars [2]-[4]) the trial judge articulated the correct principles.

25The trial judge set out the evidence and summarised the Crown case in the following terms (at [18]):

""The Crown, in brief, submitted that the medical and scientific evidence, the timeline, the tension in the relationship, the lack of any other person with opportunity, what was heard by the neighbour and the statements of the accused permitted the inference that the deceased was strangled and/or hit over the head (either with the juicer bowl or otherwise) by the accused although it is unclear in which order these acts are said to have occurred. (Given that the accused was on trial for manslaughter and not murder, the possible financial gain that might have been a motive was not relied on.)""


26The critical portions of the trial judge's judgment are at pars [20]-[22]. It is convenient to set them out in full:

""[20] It is clear that identification of the cause of death or the precise acts that resulted in that cause need not be identified in every case, though it is obviously usually necessary to do so in order to show that it is the accused who was responsible. Here, the crucial question is whether the deceased's death was caused by the unlawful and dangerous act of the accused. There can be no doubt that answering this question requires focus on what the jury are able, as a matter of common sense and reason, to conclude from the evidence as a whole. The mere fact that the Crown case is possible could not, of course, justify a conviction. The evidence must be such that the accused could, though not necessarily would, lawfully be convicted upon it: May v O'Sullivan [1955] HCA 38; (1955) 92 CLR 654 at [7]. 

[21] It is important, indeed crucial, to understand that reasoning by inference is an essential part of the jury's consideration of the charge and that this may not always be capable of clear articulation, as is evidenced by the injunction frequently given that common sense has a significant part to play in drawing inferences. Of course, technical medical evidence is not a matter of common sense but of expertise, though its significance may well depend on common sense inferences derived from other material. That material, and how it impinges on or is affected by the medical evidence and, ultimately on the issues in the case, are matters for the jury to evaluate. Given the time frame in which it is possible that the injuries were suffered and the uncertainties of the cause of death, the surrounding circumstances - so far as there is evidence of them, are crucially important. Thus, for example, the juicer bowl may have inflicted the laceration to the deceased's chin, but was it wielded by the accused and, if so, in what circumstances? If he had used it, why did he leave it there in full sight and, if it were bloodstained, why was there no blood on the floor? If the deceased fell down the stairs why did the accused not mention it? This would require consideration, amongst other things, of his mental state at the time he spoke. If saucepans falling to the floor explains the noise heard by the neighbour, how did this happen and what inferences arose from it? Was it merely the sound of the juicer bowl hitting the floor and, if so (since it was thrown at the wall above the kitchen door), who threw it and why? Did it cause an injury to the deceased and, if so, in what circumstances? For example, did it cause any serious injury or one or more that was or were relevant to the deceased's death? Did the deceased fall down the stairs and could this event occur independently of the accused and, if not, did the accused do it deliberately or accidentally or in self defence? I mention these matters by way of example only - the range of factual issues is much wider of course. At the end of the day, one must remain acutely aware that inferences may be able to bridge any apparent gaps in the Crown case. 

[22] Accepting, however, that there is no bright line separating 'conjecture' from common sense or inferential reasoning, the evidence must be such as to enable a lawful verdict of guilt. Much might be left uncertain but a judge must direct acquittal where, in his or her view, a guilty verdict would necessarily involve inadmissible conjecture. Inevitably, this will be a matter of fact and degree. In some cases, the multiplication of circumstances, taken together (though ignoring those matters that assist the accused), will be capable of leading to a conclusion of sufficient certainty to justify conviction, in which event, there is a case to answer. Here, however, the number of possibilities and the varying inferences available if one or another path of reasoning be followed add to uncertainty rather than reduce it. The choice of path is fraught with considerable doubt and each has substantial gaps. So far as the medical evidence pertaining to the event or events that caused death, a very significant complicating feature is the evidence, not given at the first trial, of the 24-hour time frame in which the injuries may have been suffered. Amongst other things, this made it distinctly less important than it earlier appeared that a fall down the stairs almost certainly did not explain all the injuries.""

Ground 1

The submissions of the Crown

27The Crown focused on par [22] of the judgment of the trial judge stating that although he had articulated the correct test earlier in his reasons, his statement in that paragraph: ""In some cases, the multiplication of circumstances, taken together (though ignoring those matters that assist the accused), will be capable of leading to a conclusion of sufficient certainty to justify conviction, in which event, there is a case to answer"", erroneously stated the test to be applied. The Crown stated that this was not the correct test. Its submissions emphasised that a directed verdict is not available merely because a judge believes a verdict would be unsafe or unsatisfactory. It was submitted that the trial judge contemplated a variety of factual scenarios and integral to his reasoning was that it was relevant to consider situations in which the strength of the Crown case varied. It was put that this was contrary to what was said in Doney v The Queen supra and R v JMR (1991) 57 A Crim R 39, which state that the Crown case must be taken at its highest and that the trial judge cannot direct a verdict of acquittal if there is evidence in support of the Crown case upon which the accused could be convicted even though a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence might be formulated.

28The Crown submitted that the evidence at its highest was that the act of the respondent causing the injury or injuries to the deceased which constituted an unlawful and dangerous act were caused by him during their physical altercation overheard by the next door neighbour less than an hour before the respondent finally called 000.

The submissions of the respondent

29The respondent pointed to pars [2]-[4] of the judgment of the trial judge and submitted that they did not reveal any error of law. He submitted that the reference in par [22] to ""sufficient certainty"" must be read in its context; his Honour there meaning sufficient certainty to justify a conviction without conjecture or speculation. He pointed to the fact that the trial judge stated in his reasons that it was not sufficient in a circumstantial case that there may be another reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence which the prosecution has failed to exclude to justify a directed verdict of acquittal. The respondent also sought to draw some comfort from remarks made by the trial judge during the course of argument on the issue to show that he understood the correct test.

30In addition, the respondent submitted that any error made by the trial judge was in fact an error of mixed fact and law, pointing out that the directed verdict by its very nature involved an evaluation of the evidence, that being a question of fact.

Consideration

31The principles on which a trial judge should direct a verdict of acquittal are well settled. The question is whether at the time a no case to answer submission is made the accused could lawfully be convicted on the evidence as it stood at that time: May v O'Sullivan [1955] HCA 38; (1955) 92 CLR 654 at 658. In Doney v The Queen supra, in addition to the passage cited by the trial judge the Court made the following remarks (at 214-215, citations omitted):

""It follows that, if there is evidence (even if tenuous or inherently weak or vague) which can be taken into account by the jury in its deliberations and that evidence is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty, the matter must be left to the jury for its decision. Or, to put the matter in more usual terms, a verdict of not guilty may be directed only if there is a defect in the evidence such that, taken at its highest, it will not sustain a verdict of guilty.

It is necessary only to observe that neither the power of a court of criminal appeal to set aside a verdict that is unsafe or unsatisfactory nor the inherent power of a court to prevent an abuse of process provides any basis for enlarging the powers of a trial judge at the expense of the traditional jury function. The power of a court of criminal appeal to set aside a verdict on the ground that it is unsafe or unsatisfactory, like other appellate powers, is supervisory in nature. Its application to the fact-finding function of a jury does not involve an interference with the traditional division of functions between judge and jury in a criminal trial.""

32It is also clear from the authorities that the sufficiency of evidence to warrant a conviction is to be resolved without regard to evidence which favours the accused as, for example, by qualifying, contradicting or explaining the evidence in support of a conviction (see R v R supra at 81, 84-85). Further, in a case such as the present which depends in the main on circumstantial evidence, a judge cannot direct a verdict of acquittal if there is evidence in support of the Crown case on which the accused could be convicted even though a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence can be formulated: R v JMR supra at 44.

33The learned trial judge early in his judgment correctly articulated these propositions. However, following his statement of the Crown case (at [18]) he adopted a somewhat different approach. In par [20] of his judgment he stated that the mere fact the Crown case is possible could not justify a conviction. It is difficult to see how this could be reconciled with the passage from Doney cited above to the effect that an acquittal can only be directed if there is a defect in the evidence taken at its highest which would mean it would not sustain a verdict of guilty. It is also difficult to reconcile with the statement in that case that it is not sufficient that the trial judge forms the view that any conviction would be unsafe or unsatisfactory.

34The trial judge at this point, however, did refer to May v O'Sullivan supra.

35In par [21] of his judgment, the trial judge referred to a series of alternative hypotheses which may have resulted in the death of the deceased. In par [22] as the Crown pointed out, he again referred to the need for a conclusion of sufficient certainty to justify a conviction, although pointing to the difference between what he described as conjecture and commonsense or inferential reasoning.

36It seems to me that the trial judge erred in law in two respects. First, his statement of the need for sufficient certainty implied an evaluation process of the weight of the evidence as distinct from a consideration of the question of whether the evidence taken at its highest could support a verdict of guilty. Second, and related to this issue, the trial judge reached his conclusion after evaluating alternative hypotheses which it was open to the jury to consider, contrary to the approach referred to above and in particular what was said by this Court in R v JMR supra at 44. 

37There remains the issue of whether the error of the trial judge was an error of law alone or an error of mixed fact and law. It was correctly accepted by the parties that the Crown was not entitled to appeal on a question of mixed fact and law. If what the trial judge did was to wrongly apply the correct principles to the facts, that would be an error of mixed fact and law and an appeal would not lie (see Smith v R (2000) 1 WLR 1644 at 1653).

38The respondent contended that in the present case any error of the trial judge was an error of that nature and that at most the trial judge had wrongly concluded, in accordance with the correct principles, that there was not evidence on which a jury could convict, thereby committing an error of mixed fact and law.

39Although support for this argument can be derived from the correct statement of the principles in the opening paragraphs of the judgment of the trial judge, it seems to me for the reasons set out above he failed to apply these principles in reaching his conclusion, in particular in his requirement of sufficient certainty and in his consideration of various hypotheses favourable to the accused. The trial judge in these circumstances in my view, applied incorrect principles to his consideration of the issue and thereby committed an error of law alone.

40It follows that this ground of appeal has been made out.

Ground 2

41In these circumstances it is not strictly necessary to deal with ground 2. However, I do not believe there was an error of law in the comment by the trial judge that it is usually necessary to identify the cause of death to show that the accused was responsible. The trial judge stated consistently with what was said in R v PL supra that the cause of death need not be identified in every case and his expression of the view as to what would generally be required did not constitute a legal error.

42However, the comment was unhelpful. What his Honour was required to do in considering whether or not there was evidence on which a jury could convict in a circumstantial case of this nature, was to consider the evidence as a whole (see R v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; (2007) 228 CLR 618 at [46]), ignoring alternative hypotheses, to determine whether it was open to the jury to convict on that evidence. What is or is not usually necessary is irrelevant to that consideration.

Discretion

43There remains the question of whether this Court should quash the acquittal under s 107(5) of the Act and if so whether it should exercise its powers under s 107(6) to order a new trial. Whilst not directly addressing the issue raised under s 107(5), the respondent contended that a new trial should not be ordered. He contended that a conviction following a retrial would likely be overturned on appeal as unreasonable, that it was the second directed verdict by a Supreme Court judge, that an order for a retrial would undermine community confidence in the criminal justice system and that the respondent had clearly suffered from four months imprisonment, strict bail conditions and the stress and uncertainty surrounding the Crown appeals.

44The Crown submitted that a new trial should be ordered, pointing to the fact that the charge involved the taking of human life, a matter that has always been regarded as serious. The Crown also pointed to the fact that prior to the second trial Dr Botterill, having viewed the premises, concluded that the likelihood of the injuries being incurred from falling down from the top of the stairs was at most a theoretical possibility and that the death resulted from a heart attack was a remote and unlikely possibility. The Crown in those circumstances submitted that the circumstantial case was a strong one.

45The manner in which the discretion should be exercised was considered by this Court in R v PL supra. In that case Spigelman CJ, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, made the following comments at [88]-[93]:

""[88] In a passage frequently cited by Australian Courts, Black J said in Green v United States, 355 US 184 at 187-188 (1957): 

'The underlying idea, one that is deeply ingrained in at least the Anglo-American system of jurisprudence, is that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.'

[89] Accordingly, there are circumstances in which the courts will order a stay of a second prosecution. (See, eg, Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [116]-[118]). 

[90] In my opinion, in the context of an appeal against an acquittal by directed verdict, this Court should exercise its discretion not to order a new trial if it is satisfied that a conviction would be overturned as unreasonable, or on any other basis which would not result in a new trial on a successful conviction appeal. 

[91] Although, on the authority of R v R, the trial judge cannot direct a verdict on that basis, the principle of double jeopardy, notwithstanding its partial abrogation, remains a fundamental principle of our criminal law. It should be given effect in the manner I have indicated. 

[92] The Crown relied, on the exercise of the discretion, on the principle that the Court should not constrain the prosecutorial discretion. In Maxwell v The Queen (1995-1996) 184 CLR 501, Dawson and McHugh JJ said at 512: 

'Our courts do not purport to exercise control over the institution or continuation of criminal proceedings, save where it is necessary to do so to prevent an abuse of process or to ensure a fair trial.'

[93] If this Court formed the opinion that an appeal from a new trial would be upheld, then that new trial would constitute a relevant abuse of process.""

46In that case the Court, applying these principles to broadly similar facts to the facts which emerged at the second trial, ordered a new trial on the ground of manslaughter but not of murder.

47It is not necessary to deal in detail with the competing contentions of the parties as to the strength of the case against the respondent. Suffice to say that on the evidence outlined above, particularly the fact that the respondent and the deceased were alone in the house, the sounds heard by the neighbour, the statements of the respondent made on 7 April 2007 and the evidence of Dr Botterill, is it by no means certain that a jury verdict of guilty would be set aside as unreasonable. 

48So far as the other matters put by the respondent are concerned, this undoubtedly is a tragic case. However, having regard to the gravity of the offence, it seems to me ultimately a matter for the prosecutorial authorities to determine whether or not to proceed further against the accused. Those authorities undoubtedly would take into account the fact that a further trial will be a third trial and the other matters put by the respondent in this appeal in making that decision.

49In these circumstances, in my opinion, the Court should make the following orders:

1 Appeal allowed.

2 Verdict of acquittal on charge of manslaughter quashed.

3 Order a new trial on the charge of manslaughter.

50SIMPSON J: I agree with the Chief Justice.

51ADAMSON J: I agree.

2709894,Aouad and El-Zeyat v R [2011] NSWCCA 61,"JUDGMENT 

1McCLELLAN CJ AT CL: I agree with James J. 

2JAMES J: Ramzi Aouad and Nasaem El-Zeyat appealed against their convictions on a charge that on 30 October 2003 at Punchbowl they murdered Ahmed Fahda. A trial in which they were found guilty was conducted before Bell J (as her Honour then was) and a jury between 31 March 2006 and 16 May 2006. A third accused Adnan Darwiche, who was charged with being both an accessory before the fact and an accessory after the fact to the murder of Adam Fahda, was acquitted on both of those charges. There was no application by either appellant for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on him. 

3At the trial the Crown case, very broadly stated, was that shortly after two o'clock in the afternoon of 30 October 2003 the deceased had been a passenger in a Pajero 4-wheel drive vehicle (""the Pajero"") driven by a man named Bassam Said, which was travelling in Punchbowl Road, Punchbowl. The Pajero ran out of petrol and Ahmed Fahda and Bassam Said pushed the Pajero into a service station on Punchbowl Road near the intersection with Dudley Street. Both men got out of the Pajero. 

4Another vehicle, a Commodore, stopped near the service station. Two men armed with pistols (""the shooters"" or ""the gunmen"") got out of the Commodore. They walked past the deceased, who was looking into the bonnet of the Pajero and, from close range, fired a large number of shots into the deceased's body, killing him. The gunmen then ran from the service station and boarded the Commodore which had been driven into Dudley Street. The Commodore then drove off. 

5The issue at the trial, so far as the appellants were concerned, was whether the Crown could prove that the two appellants were the gunmen. The Crown case at the trial depended heavily on the evidence of the witnesses Bassam Said, Wahib Hannouf, Haissam Hannouf and Tony Haddad. Apart from the evidence of these witnesses, there was evidence from a number of witnesses who had witnessed the shooting but who could not identify either of the gunmen, some limited formal admissions by the appellants and some pieces of circumstantial evidence. 

6Having regard to some of the grounds of appeal against conviction, it is necessary to examine in some detail the evidence of many of the witnesses in the Crown case. 

EVIDENCE OF THE CROWN WITNESSES 
BASSAM SAID'S EVIDENCE 

7As at 30 October 2003 Bassam Said had known Tony Haddad and the appellant El-Zeyat for about five years. He had known of the deceased Ahmed Fahda but had not known him personally. 

8On the morning of 30 October 2003 Bassam Said received a telephone call from Tony Haddad, who asked Bassam Said to come to his house and pick him up. Bassam Said drove to Tony Haddad's place in the Pajero, which was half owned by Bassam Said and half owned by Tony Haddad. Bassam Said picked up Tony Haddad and they drove to Wiley Park. 

9At Wiley Park they had a meeting with Adnan Darwiche and the appellant El-Zeyat. At Wiley Park Bassam Said merely said hello to Darwiche and El-Zeyat and had no further conversation with either of them. 

10Bassam Said drove off in the Pajero with El-Zeyat as a passenger. In Punchbowl Bassam Said saw Ahmed Fahda and his brother Douse Fahda in a vehicle. 

11Bassam Said stopped the Pajero. El-Zeyat got out of the Pajero and Ahmed Fahda got into the Pajero and asked Bassam Said to take him to Tony Haddad's house. 

12Bassam Said drove Ahmed Fahda to Tony Haddad's mother-in-law's house. He sounded the horn of the Pajero but no one came out of the house. Ahmed Fahda then asked Bassam Said to give him a lift to where his car was parked in Punchbowl. 

13The Pajero ""started conking out"" of petrol. The engine stopped. Ahmed Fahda got out of the Pajero and pushed it all the way to a service station, while Bassam Said steered the vehicle, also pushing (apparently with his foot). 

14The service station proprietor came out and helped push the Pajero into the service station. Bassam Said started getting petrol for the Pajero from a bowser, while Ahmed Fahda was looking under the bonnet of the Pajero, which Bassam Said had raised. 

15Bassam Said gave further evidence as follows: 

Q. What happened next? 
A. I finished filling up the petrol. By the time I was looking up to where Mr Fahda was I heard gun shots and I could see his body shaking and -- 

Q. Did you recognise either or one of those people doing the shooting? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Who did you see? 
A. Nasaem El-Zeyat and Ramzi Aouad. 

Q. Were you able to see where the gun shots were coming from? 
A. I seen two people firing guns. 

16As at 30 October 2003 Bassam Said did not know the appellant Aouad. He subsequently found out that the shooter other than El-Zeyat was Aouad, when Aouad introduced himself to Bassam Said ""days after the event"". 

17When the shooting started, Bassam Said ""hit the floor"" and ran to the back of the Pajero. The shooting stopped. Bassam Said saw that Ahmed Fahda was lying on the ground and he asked a person at the service station to call an ambulance. The two shooters ""walked off or ran off, I don't know"". 

18Bassam Said was ""shocked"" at what had happened. After some indecision, he got back into the Pajero and drove off to his house in Bettina Court. Bassam Said was ""going off my head"". Tony Haddad was at Bassam Said's house, when Bassam Said arrived home. 

19About two minutes later the Commodore motor vehicle arrived. Bassam Said saw the two appellants in the front yard of his house. El-Zeyat wanted to park the Commodore in the garage at Bassam Said's house and El-Zeyat drove the Commodore into the garage. Aouad and El-Zeyat were holding guns, which they ""unclogged' and they then disappeared. 

20Bassam Said then drove the Pajero to a friend's place. Bassam Said was asked by the Crown Prosecutor whether he remembered going to Menai on 30 October 2003. He answered, ""Probably, I can't remember"". After some further questions and answers, the Crown Prosecutor made a successful application under s 38 of the Evidence Act for leave to cross-examine Bassam Said. 

21In cross-examination by the Crown Bassam Said agreed that there had been a meeting at which he was present at Menai on the evening of 30 October 2003. At the meeting he had been told by El-Zeyat to go to the police and make a statement ""saying it was not them"". 

22On 5 November 2003 Bassam Said was arrested. He was told that he was under arrest for the murder of Ahmed Fahda. He was taken to a police station and questioned. He also made a statement, which he described in his evidence at the trial as a ""bullshit statement"" (Bassam Said's first statement). 

23In the first statement Bassam Said said that he did not recognise either of the shooters. He made the ""bullshit"" statement, because ""that is what they (the accused) wanted"". 

24As Bassam Said was leaving the police station on 5 November 2003, he was served with a summons to attend the New South Wales Crime Commission. He attended the Crime Commission and was questioned. He swore to give truthful evidence but told a number of lies. He told the Crime Commission that the vehicle he had been driving was not his. 

25Bassam Said made a second statement on 3 June 2004. At the time of making this statement he was in custody, bail refused, on a charge of having been an accessory after the fact to the murder of Ahmed Fahda. 

26While in custody he had been moved to the Special Purposes Centre at Long Bay and while there he had communicated regularly with the Hannouf brothers. He had learnt from police that the Hannouf brothers were providing assistance to the police and both Wahib Hannouf and Haissam Hannouf confirmed this. Bassam Said denied in his evidence that he and the Hannouf brothers had spoken to each other about the evidence they would give. 

27Bassam Said was told by police that, if he made a statement, the charge against him would be dropped or the police would not oppose bail or he would receive an indemnity against prosecution on the charge of having been an accessory. 

28In the second statement of 3 June 2004 Bassam Said for the first time identified Aouad as having been one of the shooters. He said in the statement that he had not been able to properly see the second shooter. 

29On 12 July 2004 Bassam Said made a third statement. He was then still in custody. In the third statement he, for the first time, identified El-Zeyat as having been one of the shooters. He said that he had not been prepared to identify El-Zeyat earlier, because of threats made to him and also because El-Zeyat was a friend. 

30In August 2004 Bassam Said was released on bail and in September 2004 the charge of having been an accessory was discontinued. 

31Bassam Said made a final statement on 16 December 2004. He was further interviewed by police on 5 April 2006 and 2 May 2006.He gave evidence in the committal proceedings on 13 May 2006. 

32Bassam Said received or sought a number of benefits for cooperating with the police. Before he made the second statement he was promised that the information which would be contained in the statement would not be used in any criminal proceedings against him. He asked for protection for himself and his family and a weekly wage of $500 for a period of a year and it would seem that these benefits were granted. Bassam Said also demanded that criminal charges against one of his brothers, whose whereabouts were unknown, be discontinued but this did not happen. 

33At the time Bassam Said gave evidence at the trial the Crime Commission was paying the rent on his family home. After he had completed giving evidence, he was to be provided with an overseas holiday, as part of a witness protection programme. 

34Although he received the benefits I have referred to, Bassam Said did not receive any indemnity against prosecution for any alleged offence. 

35Bassam Said was aware that the Pajero was a ""rebirth"" vehicle. A criminal charge against him in relation to the Pajero was discontinued. Bassam Said admitted in his evidence at the trial that he and Tony Haddad had been buying damaged vehicles and fitting them with stolen parts. 

36In December 2005 Bassam Said had been involved with Tony Haddad and another man, in what was described at the trial as a ""rip"" (that is a drug rip-off). Said drove Haddad to a place where an unknown man gave Haddad a parcel. Said did not know what was in the parcel and did not ask any questions, apart from asking Haddad what was in the parcel, to which Haddad answered that he did not know. Bassam Said thought it was likely that the transaction was illegal. Bassam Said received $20,000 for his involvement. 

37Bassam Said refused to come to court to give evidence at the trial. Warrants for his arrest for him to be brought to court to give evidence were issued, including a warrant of 13 April 2006. Bassam Said agreed in cross-examination at the trial that he was prepared to take steps to avoid execution of the warrant ""for the safety of my family"". Bassam Said said that he had been at his home but police had not come to his home to execute the warrant. 

38Bassam Said gave evidence that he had intended to attend court voluntarily on 2 May 2006. However, he said that in the early hours of the morning of that day, while he was travelling from Kings Cross to his home, a male person wearing a balaclava had opened the door of his vehicle while it was stationary and had shot him in the leg. Bassam Said telephoned an emergency number and drove himself to Sutherland Hospital. While he was at Sutherland Hospital he was arrested pursuant to the warrant and he remained in police custody until after he had completed giving evidence. 

TONY HADDAD'S EVIDENCE 

39As at 30 October 2003 Tony Haddad had known all of Ahmed Fahda, Ramzi Aouad known as ""Fidel"", Nasaem El-Zeyat known as ""Erdt"", Adnan Darwiche, Mohammed Touma and Bassam Said for a number of years. 

40As at 30 October 2003 Tony Haddad was living at an address in Condell Park. On the morning of that day he received a telephone call from a man named Jalal Alameddine, who told him that Ahmed Fahda was at his house and wanted to speak to Tony Haddad. Tony Haddad had a conversation on the telephone with Ahmed Fahda in which Ahmed Fahda said, ""I have to see you"". Tony Haddad said that he was ""a bit busy"" and that Ahmed Fahda should call back later in the day. 

41Tony Haddad then had a telephone conversation with El-Zeyat. In the conversation Tony Haddad said that he was going to see Ahmed Fahda. El-Zeyat said that Tony Haddad should wait until El-Zeyat came over. El- Zeyat said ""Don't meet up with him. He is a dirty cunt"". 

42Bassam Said arrived at Tony Haddad's home, driving the Pajero. Tony Haddad got in the Pajero and they drove off. While in the Pajero Tony Haddad received a telephone call from El-Zeyat, who said, ""I am on my way. Meet me at Wiley Park park"". 

43Bassam Said and Tony Haddad stopped at the park, where they saw El-Zeyat. El-Zeyat was carrying a gun on his hip. 

44Tony Haddad also saw Adnan Darwiche in the park. El-Zeyat and Darwiche had a conversation with each other, which Tony Haddad was unable to hear. 

45Darwiche said to Tony Haddad, ""What does Ahmed (Fahda) want from you?"" and Tony Haddad replied, ""I don't know"". Darwiche said, ""Fidel's been looking for him"". 

46El-Zeyat and Darwiche had a further conversation, which Tony Haddad was unable to hear. 

47Ahmed Fahda telephoned Tony Haddad and said that he would meet Tony Haddad at his parents' place in Punchbowl. When the conversation ended one of El-Zeyat and Darwiche asked, ""Was that him?"" and Tony Haddad replied, ""Yeah, he is at my parents' house"". 

48El-Zeyat asked Bassam Said if he could give El-Zeyat a lift and the two left together in the Pajero. Darwiche and Tony Haddad travelled to Bassam Said's house at Bettina Court, Greenacre. 

49Tony Haddad tried to telephone El-Zeyat but could not establish contact. Eventually he spoke to El-Zeyat. Tony Haddad's evidence continued:- 

""I said, ""Where are you? I am at Bass' house"". He said, ""I am doing something, I am doing something. I will ring you back. I won't be long"""". 

50Tony Haddad heard the sound of gunshots. Bassam Said's house was about two kilometres from the service station in Punchbowl Road. Darwiche said, ""Ring up the boys"". Tony Haddad tried without success to ring El-Zeyat. He telephoned Bassam Said and ""he was screaming off his head"". 

51The Pajero arrived at the house. Bassam Said parked the Pajero outside the house. Bassam Said ""was jumping out, banging his head with his hands"". His face was white. Darwiche told Bassam Said to park the Pajero properly and Bassam Said parked the Pajero on the driveway in front of the garage. 

52A Commodore vehicle then arrived at the house. Tony Haddad's evidence continued:- 

""Erdt and Fidel jumped out and started running towards the house and Mohammed Touma came out and he was running too"". 

53El-Zeyat and Aouad ""clocked"" guns by ""pulling the top back"". When they did this, one bullet fell on the floor. The guns were then wrapped in a jumper. About 10 to 15 minutes had passed from the time that Tony Haddad had heard the sound of gunshots. 

54Darwiche said, ""Move the car"". The Pajero was moved and the Commodore was parked in the garage. El-Zeyat said, ""I'll get rid of it later"". 

55El-Zeyat, Aouad and Darwiche got into Darwiche's car and left. Bassam Said and Tony Haddad walked to Bassam Said's parents' house nearby. Tony Haddad made a telephone call and arranged with his father to drive him to his home. 

56At Tony Haddad's house Bassam Said was still pale and white. He sat on the floor with his hands over his face. 

57El-Zeyat arrived at Tony Haddad's house. He said to Bassam Said, ""What's the matter?"" 

58Later Tony Haddad travelled by car to Menai. On the way El-Zeyat, who was in the car, received a telephone call from Darwiche. 

59The car travelled to McDonalds at Menai, where there was a meeting with Darwiche. Darwiche said to El-Zeyat ""We got to talk"". However, Darwiche said that certain other persons at McDonalds looked like police and that they should go elsewhere to talk. 

60Darwiche, El-Zeyat, Tony Haddad, Bassam Said and another man all travelled in the same car to a small park. They walked into the park. Tony Haddad's evidence continued:- 

Q. What conversation then occurred? 
A. Erdt was jumping around like a monkey. He was screaming like saying that he dropped him, he dropped him. 

Q. Can as best you can I said, he said? 
A. He said, ""I dropped him. I dropped him."" I said, ""Who?"" He said, ""Ahmed, I know it's Ahmed, Ahmed Fahda."" I said, ""Did you kill him?"" He said, ""Yeah."" 

... 

Q. What more was said, again, I said, he said? 
A. I said to him, I said to him, ""Did you shoot him?"" He said, ""Yeah."" ""Who was with you?"" He said, ""Me, Eddie, Fidel."" 

61Darwiche said to Bassam Said:- 

""Mate, I don't know, just make sure you don't say nothing about the boys. If you say anything about them, you know, going to be problems."" 

62Darwiche also said to Bassam Said :- 

""If the police ask you who done it, tell them it wasn't the Darwiche family"". 

63Darwiche also said to Bassam Said:- 

""Make sure you don't go to the cops, and, you know, if you do, we'll get you. We'll get your family, if you know, I wouldn't."" He said, ""I have to say this to you so you know where I stand."" 

64Bassam Said said:- 

""I am not going to the police. Don't worry about it"". 

65The group then drove back to McDonalds at Menai. Darwiche got out. The other four El-Zeyat, Tony Haddad, Bassam Said and the other man drove to Tony Haddad's house at Condell Park. 

66Tony Haddad went to a hotel where he spent the night of 30 October 2003. 

67The following day at Tony Haddad's home there was a conversation. Darwiche, El-Zeyat, Aouad, Mohammed Touma and Tony Haddad were present. In this conversation Aouad said, ""I am worried if the camera got my tattoo"". 

68Tony Haddad's evidence continued:- 

Fidel said, ""Anyway we got the cunt"" and then Erdt said, ""We got him, we fucked his mum, I emptied the clip into him: and Fidel said ""Yeah, me too"". 

69On 31 October 2003 Ahmed Fahda's brother Hussain Fahda and some other men assaulted Tony Haddad and attempted to kidnap him. Tony Haddad did not reveal who had killed Ahmed Fahda. He did not report the assault to the police. 

70In 2004 Tony Haddad was arrested on a charge of perjury and refused bail. For a period of two to three months Haddad, when questioned by police, denied any knowledge of the shooting of Ahmed Fahda. He was told by police that he would be charged with having been an accessory after the fact to the murder of Ahmed Fahda. 

71While he was still in custody Tony Haddad learnt that Hussain Fahda was in the same gaol. He became concerned for his own safety and decided that he would assist the authorities. 

72Haddad had a first meeting with representatives of the Crime Commission. There was discussion about his providing assistance and his being granted an indemnity. Haddad made statements to the police between July 2004 and December 2004. He was promised an indemnity against ""everything"", including the perjury charge. However, he pleaded guilty to the perjury charge because he got tired of waiting for the indemnity to be actually granted. 

73In November 2004 Haddad was sentenced for the offence of perjury to which he had pleaded guilty. The sentencing judge said in her remarks that she was allowing a discount of 60 per cent for the plea of guilty and the assistance provided and to be provided by Haddad in this matter and other unrelated matters. 

74In May 2005 Haddad refused to give evidence in the committal proceedings, because the indemnity had not yet been granted. 

75An indemnity against prosecution was finally granted on 13 March 2006. Haddad was indemnified against alleged firearms offences, offences of stealing and receiving stolen motor vehicles and stolen motor vehicle parts and offences of concealing a number of serious indictable offences, including several murders. He had been charged only with the firearms offences. 

76An affidavit by an officer of the Crime Commission disclosed the financial benefits Haddad had received for his assistance being payments of $50,000 and $11,086, payments of $300 per week since December 2005 and rental payments. Haddad admitted in cross-examination at the trial that his house had been partly purchased with funds from criminal activities. The Crime Commission had not brought any proceeds of crime proceedings against him. 

77In November 2005 Haddad had been involved in a ""rip"" (a drug rip off), in which he deceived a drug dealer into handing over $300,000 (although Haddad did not know the amount at the time), in exchange for a suitcase. Haddad did not know what was in the suitcase but did not believe that it contained the drugs it was supposed to contain. Haddad performed the ""rip"" at the request of a friend. He said that he was asked to do it, because he was practised at ""conning"" people. 

78Haddad was told by the authorities that he would not be charged with any offence arising out of the ""rip"". At the time of the trial the indemnity had not been extended to any offence in relation to the ""rip"". 

79Warrants were issued for the arrest of Tony Haddad to ensure that he gave evidence at the trial. 

80On 23 March 2006 Haddad made a document, which became a defence exhibit at the trial (Exhibit 3), in which he said, ""Since I made my statement (to the police) I can no longer confirm if my statement is true and correct. This has been written of my own free will"". 

81In his evidence at the trial Tony Haddad said that the contents of Exhibit 3 were completely untruthful. He referred to pressure to which he had been subjected by a number of persons. 

WAHIB HANNOUF'S EVIDENCE 

82As at 30 October 2003 Wahib Hannouf knew the appellant Aouad. He had first met Aouad about two years before and had seen him seven to ten times during those two years, for periods of up to an hour. 

83As at 30 October 2003 Wahib Hannouf knew El-Zeyat. He had first met El-Zeyat about 6 years before and had seen him many times, perhaps 40 to 50 times. 

84As at 30 October 2003 Wahib Hannouf knew Ahmed Fahda, having first met him in the year 2000. Ahmed Fahda had had a dispute with relatives of Wahib Hannouf and had ""shot"" at the family home. 

85On 30 October 2003 Wahib Hannouf was driving a vehicle in a generally north easterly direction in Punchbowl Road. His brother Haissam Hannouf was a passenger in the vehicle. Wahib Hannouf was driving on the opposite side of Punchbowl Road from the service station, near the intersection of Punchbowl Road and Dudley Street. He was travelling ""really slow"". 

86Wahib Hannouf looked into the service station and ""I've seen Ahmed (Fahda) at the back of a 4-wheel drive"". Wahib Hannouf's evidence continued:- 

""When I seen him I slowed down even more because he was in gaol because, you know, because my Dad put a statement against him and I heard he has been out of gaol so I wanted to see if it was really him. So I slowed down and Ahmed was actually walking towards the front at that stage"". 

87The bonnet of the 4-wheel drive vehicle was opened. 

88Wahib Hannouf saw a blue Commodore vehicle and he saw Aouad and El-Zeyat, who he referred to as ""Fidel"" and ""Erdt"", walking towards the service station and Ahmed Fahda. Both men were wearing hooded jumpers. Wahib Hannouf's evidence continued:- 

""I seen two Glocks, they pulled out two Glocks from their pants and they just kept walking towards Ahmed, they sort of went behind Ahmed"". 

89The two men were walking on the footpath outside the service station. They walked past where Ahmed Fahda was standing. They were walking in the opposite direction to that in which Wahib Hannouf's vehicle was travelling. 

90Wahib Hannouf's evidence continued:- 

""Ahmed was in front of the 4-wheel drive and they were actually behind him, that is when I wanted to park and that is when I heard the shots"". 

91Wahib Hannouf was not still looking at the service station when he heard the shots, because he was driving and had to steer his vehicle. 

92The Commodore started moving, either just before the shots or when the shots were happening. There was only one person in the Commodore. 

93Haissam Hannouf told Wahib Hannouf to ""take off"". Wahib Hannouf turned into a side street and stopped. He said to his brother, ""I want to go back and see what happened"". Haissam Hannouf said that he did not want to go back. Haissam Hannouf got out of the vehicle. 

94Wahib Hannouf drove the vehicle back to the vicinity of the service station and parked it in Dudley Street. He remained in the area for about 40 minutes. 

95Wahib Hannouf gave evidence of a number of incidents between the Hannouf family and the Fahda family. 

96In about 2000 Ahmed Fahda had demanded $50,000 from Wahib Hannouf's brothers in relation to a vehicle. Ahmed Fahda threatened to shoot at the Hannouf family home. The Hannouf family was in fear of Ahmed Fahda and obtained guns to protect themselves. The issue was resolved, when it was explained to Ahmed Fahda that the Hannoufs had had nothing to do with the vehicle in question. 

97In 2001 Ahmed Fahda had a dispute with cousins of Wahib Hannouf. Ahmed Fahda demanded that Wahib Hannouf present his cousins to Ahmed Fahda, so that Ahmed Fahda could shoot them. Wahib Hannouf refused. Ahmed Fahda sent his father to speak to Wahib Hannouf's father. Ahmed Fahda arrived with his brother and started shooting. Wahib Hannouf was not injured. 

98At the trial there was evidence from a police officer that enquiries into this incident were still proceeding but the police had difficulty in accepting the Hannouf brothers' version of what had happened. 

99Wahib Hannouf was aware that Ahmed Fahda had been in prison from 2002 to sometime in 2003. Although it was his understanding that all issues between the two families had been resolved, some members of his family had gone overseas to avoid any reprisals which might take place after Ahmed Fahda was released from gaol. 

100Wahib Hannouf was granted an indemnity against prosecution for offences of armed robbery, kidnapping, aggravated breaking, entering and stealing, demanding property with menaces and drug offences. Wahib Hannouf denied that he had committed any of the alleged offences referred to in the indemnity. He did, however, admit that he had bought and on-sold Sudafed tablets so that others could manufacture amphetamine. 

101Wahib Hannouf made a statement to police in February 2004, before receiving the indemnity, although he made the statement on the understanding that he would be receiving an indemnity. 

102Wahib Hannouf had made an earlier statement to police on 13 November 2003. In this statement he told police that he had been travelling on Punchbowl Road on 30 October 2003 and had parked his vehicle in Dudley Street. However, he did not tell police that he had seen the two appellants and did not describe the events which he had witnessed, because he was concerned about the repercussions, if he did so. He also omitted disclosing the presence of his brother Haissam Hannouf, because his brother did not want to be involved. Wahib Hannouf said in this statement that he had never previously met Ahmed Fahda. He also omitted to tell police that he had had problems with the Fahda family. 

103Subsequently, the Hannouf brothers Wahib Hannouf, Haissam Hannouf and another brother (all of whom were in gaol) agreed that they would speak to the Crime Commission. 

104Wahib Hannouf revealed to a police officer that one of the gunmen had been El-Zeyat. He told the police officer that he would only give a brief version of events, until he knew what benefits he would receive. He declined to sign a statement until he knew that he would get an indemnity. He was told that it was up to the Attorney-General whether an indemnity would be granted. 

105Wahib Hannouf subsequently made a comprehensive statement to police. 

106Wahib Hannouf gave evidence that the New South Wales Crime Commission had seized property and money belonging to his family, worth approximately $1.5 million. Wahib Hannouf admitted that some of the money and property had been obtained through criminal activities. He had begun negotiating for the return of the property and money from the time of his arrest and the Crime Commission had agreed that the money and property would be returned, once Wahib Hannouf had given evidence. 

107Wahib Hannouf agreed that he and his brothers had been in custody at the same time as Tony Haddad. He denied that he and his brothers had discussed with Haddad the information they would provide to police. By the time of his custody Wahib Hannouf had already made his comprehensive statement. Wahib Hannouf denied disc u ssing the events of 30 October 2003 with Bassam Said. 

HAISSAM HANNOUF'S EVIDENCE 

108Haissam Hannouf was a qualified mechanic who had worked at service stations. 

109As at 30 October 2003 he had known El-Zeyat for about 4-5 years during which he had seen him somewhere between five to ten times, the longest period being about five minutes. He also knew Ahmed Fadha and Mohammed Touma, who he referred to as ""Mitch"". As at 30 October 2003 he did not know the appellant Aouad. 

110There had been trouble between Ahmed Fahda and members of Haissam Hannouf's family before 30 October 2003. ""He shot our place ... him and his brother"". 

111On another occasion in about 2000 Haissam Hannouf had refused to give Ahmed Fahda a certificate for the registration of a vehicle, without first inspecting the vehicle. 

112On 30 October 2003 Haissam Hannouf was travelling as a passenger in a vehicle being driven by his brother Wahib Hannouf in a north-easterly direction in Punchbowl Road. He was travelling with his brother for the purpose of assisting his brother in renovating a house. 

113Haissam Hannouf's evidence continued:- 

Q. What happened when you were driving on Punchbowl Road? 
A. My brother saw Ahmed Fahda. 

Q. What did your brother said to you? 
A. He said, ""Look, there is Ahmed Fahda, in the service station"". 

Q. What did you say to him? 
A. I looked and I said, ""Yeah, it is him. It is true what people are saying. Like, he got out of gaol"". 

114Ahmed Fahda was in the service station on Punchbowl Road near Dudley Street. He was standing close to a Pajero 4-wheel drive vehicle. Another man was standing about two metres away from Ahmed Fahda and close to the Pajero. The bonnet of the Pajero was opened. 

115Haissam Hannouf's evidence continued:- 

""Then I seen - we seen Erdt and Fidel were walking on the footpath and walking towards the service station"". 

116Haissam Hannouf recognised the person he named as Erdt as being Nasaem El-Zeyat. He did not know who the other person was. He asked his brother, ""Who is the other person?"" and Wahib Hannouf said ""That's Fidel"". 

117Haissam Hannouf's evidence continued:- 

""I seen them putting hoods on and they got their guns out and walking quickly towards the service station"". 

118The guns the two men were carrying were black in colour and looked like police guns. 

119The two gunmen approached Ahmed Fahda who was in front of the Pajero looking inside the bonnet ""and shot him from the back"" at a range of about two to 3 metres. ""I could see Erdt and Fidel shooting Ahmed Fahda"". Ahmed Fahda fell to the ground. The two men continued shooting after Ahmed Fahda fell. 

120Haissam Hannouf's evidence continued:- 

""I told my brother to take off ... before we get ...shot by any bullets ... My brother took off and I was looking back and there was a blue Commodore and I heard it ... taking off quickly"". 

121The Commodore moved in the opposite direction to that in which the Hannouf brothers were travelling. Haissam Hannouf had first seen the Commodore when it was stationary near the service station. He recognised the driver of the Commodore as being Mohammed Touma (""Mitch""). 

122Wahib Hannouf turned off Punchbowl Road into a side street. Wahib Hannouf said that he wanted to go back to the scene of the shooting. Haissam Hannouf did not want to go with him. Haissam Hannouf got out of the car and returned to his home. 

123Haissam Hannouf received an indemnity against prosecution for a number of offences, including armed robbery, kidnapping, aggravated breaking entering and stealing, demanding property with menaces and knowingly taking part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug. 

124Haissam Hannouf agreed in cross-examination that he would not have assisted the authorities, if the indemnity had not been granted and if the property of his family which the Crime Commission had seized under proceeds of crime legislation had not been returned. He said that the indemnity was required, because it was dangerous for him and his brother to remain in gaol. 

125Haissam Hannouf and his brothers had been in the same gaol. Wahib Hannouf told his brothers that he was going to assist the authorities and all the brothers decided that they should provide assistance, because, if they did not do so, they would remain in gaol and be at risk of reprisals. Haissam Hannouf acted as spokesman for the brothers in discussing with representatives of the Crime Commission the granting of indemnities. 

126Soon after the shooting Haissam Hannouf and Wahib Hannouf discussed what Wahib Hannouf would say, if questioned by Police about his car being in Dudley Street after the shooting. Haissam Hannouf encouraged Wahib Hannouf not to tell police that they had been together in the car driving along Punchbowl Road and to tell police that he had not seen anything. Haissam Hannouf said these things because he did not want the lives of himself and his brother threatened by a member of the Fahda family. 

127Haissam Hannouf agreed in cross-examination that he had discussed with Wahib Hannouf the version of events which they would give to the Crime Commission. 

KHALED TALEB'S EVIDENCE 

128A man named Khaled Taleb gave evidence that in 2003 he knew both the appellants and Adnan Darwiche. 

129On an occasion after 20 August 2003 but before the shooting the appellant Aouad visited Khaled Taleb at his home. Aouad told Khaled Taleb that he had split up with his wife Donna Fahda, who was a sister of Ahmed Fahda, and it ""looks like this time it's for good"" and ""Donna's brothers are going to come after me, going to fucking pop me"". Khaled Taleb gave evidence that ""pop"" meant to ""shoot"". 

130Khaled Taleb received an indemnity against prosecution for a large number of alleged offences, including alleged offences of wounding, assaulting and firearms offences and being involved in murders. 

EVIDENCE OF OTHER CROWN WITNESSES ABOUT THE SHOOTING 
MICHAEL RAHMAN'S EVIDENCE 

131A witness using the pseudonym Michael Rahman gave evidence. At some time after two o'clock on 30 October 2003 Mr Rahman was driving home. He pulled into the service station on Punchbowl Road, intending to buy petrol. A 4-wheel drive Pajero was already stationary at a pump in the service station. Michael Rahman drove his vehicle past the 4-wheel drive and stopped in front of it, at the same line of petrol pumps. Mr Rahman's evidence continued:- 

""When I was just reversing my car to adjust my car to the pump, and then I heard very loud shooting, it is like a shooting, you know, so I look in my rear mirror, in my rear mirror and the side one and I saw two guys shooting, they was standing between my car and the other car and they was shooting to someone in that time"". 

132Mr Rahman saw one man (""the first man"") more than the other man. He described the first man as being:- 

""He's tall built, middle east appearance, about 170 something centimetres tall. He had hood on the head so I can't see his hair or anything like that"". 

133The first man had a goatee beard and he was carrying a black pistol that looked like a Glock. Although the first man had a hood, most of his face was exposed. 

134Mr Rahman described the second man as follows:- 

""The second person was a bit taller than the other one, he is 175 centimetres tall, he is thinner than the other one, and he had a hood on his head too, but I didn't see his face that much"". 

135Mr Rahman did not really see the face of the second man. 

136Mr Rahman's evidence continued:- 

""After that I drive forward to the side of the petrol station where the exit for Dudley Street is, and I saw the car was stop in the middle of the street with the doors open, and the engine running so I stopped in the exit of the station and I look again in the mirror. There was still shooting and when they finish they coming running beside me, all right, the two offenders, and I went to the exit in Dudley Street and the first guy, I described him, he come and get to the passenger's seat and the other guy he went to the driver's seat and they drove off"". 

137The vehicle in Dudley Street was a Commodore. Mr Rahman could not see if there was any one else in the Commodore. 

138Mr Rahman reversed his vehicle. A man was lying on the ground dying. The Pajero was then still there. A man said, ""I have to move the car"" and that man drove off in the Pajero. 

139Mr Rahman participated in the preparation of a Comfit image of the first gunman (the first man). I will discuss his evidence on this subject in more detail, when I deal with one of Aouad's grounds of appeal against conviction. 

140Mr Rahman also looked at two series of photographs for the purpose of attempting to make a photographic identification of the first man. I will describe his evidence on this subject in more detail, when I deal with the same ground of appeal by Aouad. 

SAFA MILANI'S EVIDENCE 

141Safa Milani gave evidence that on 30 October 2003 he was working at the service station in Punchbowl Road. While he was helping the driver of a truck unload stock for the shop at the service station, he heard a call for assistance and he helped others push a 4-wheel drive vehicle into the service station. He then went back to help the driver of the truck unload his stock. 

142Mr Milani heard the sounds of gunshots. He did not see the persons who did the shooting. 

143Mr Milani saw one of the men who had been pushing the 4-wheel drive lying on the ground. He saw a car on Punchbowl Road. The driver of this car appeared to be looking at the service station. The driver slowed the vehicle down. 

KERRY NOUNIS'S EVIDENCE 

144Kerry Nounis was a lawn-mowing contractor who was mowing a lawn directly opposite the service station. 

145Mr Nounis heard a number of bangs coming from the service station. At first he thought it was the sound of a car backfiring or of firecrackers. Mr Nounis saw two persons walking away to a car, a Commodore, which was in Dudley Street. He thought one of the men had a pistol in his hand. 

146Mr Nounis could only give a very general description of the two men. He thought that one of them had an olive complexion. 

147Mr Nounis took the registration number of the Commodore and later supplied it to the police. 

MOHAMMED HALWANI'S EVIDENCE 

148Mr Halwani gave evidence that in October 2003 he was an apprentice mechanic at the service station. 

149On 30 October 2003 he was working in the workshop of the service station. He heard noises like firecrackers. His evidence in chief continued:- 

""I poked my head out to see what was going on and I saw two people shooting and then I went back in"". 

150Mr Halwani said in his evidence in chief that he was not able to see any guns in the hands of the men. ""That's why I thought it was firecrackers because all I saw was smoke"". 

151The Crown was granted leave to cross-examine Mr Halwani. In cross-examination Mr Halwani agreed that in a statement he had given to police he had said, ""When I looked at the males with the guns I saw they both didn't have anything covering their faces"". He had said in the statement that the man closer to him was Lebanese, about 170 centimetres tall, medium build, with black shoulder length hair with blonde streaks in it. In his statement he said that he did not get a good look at the second man but the second man was Lebanese. 

MELE MALUPO'S EVIDENCE 

152Ms Malupo gave evidence that at around 1.00 or 2.00 pm on 30 October 2003, she was a passenger, with other family members, in a vehicle being driven by her mother along Punchbowl Road towards King Georges Road. She heard two loud noises that sounded like fireworks coming from her right hand side where the A P Service Station was located. She saw two men running from the A P Service Station towards a light green/aqua coloured car parked in the side street which ran alongside the service station. The first man got into the front passenger seat, but she did not see where the second man went. The vehicle drove away as soon as the men entered it and for this reason Ms Malupo believed that there was a driver waiting in the car. 

153Ms Malupo's mother then drove into the A P Service Station and she and her family attempted to render assistance to the deceased. 

154Ms Malupo stated that she only got a 'quick glance' at the two men. She described the first one as being of average/tall height and because of the man's nose and eyes, she believed him to be Lebanese. The first man was wearing a light brown coloured hooded jumper. She could only see the eyes and nose of the man, because the hood covered the rest of his head. Ms Malupo described the second man as being about the same height as the first man and he too was wearing a hooded jumper. 

OTHER EVIDENCE IN THE CROWN CASE 

155Apart from the evidence of the witnesses I have referred to, there were some further pieces of evidence, including:- 

1. Evidence of an association between Aouad and the Commodore vehicle, being formal admissions that he was driving the Commodore 11 days before 30 October 2003 and was in the Commodore later that month. 

2. Evidence of an association between El-Zeyat and the Commodore, being formal admissions that on 17 October 2003 Adnan Darwiche drove the Commodore to El-Zeyat's home, left it parked outside El-Zeyat's home and then drove it away from El-Zeyat's home. 

3. Evidence of the meeting at McDonalds Menai, only a few hours after the killing, between El-Zeyat, Darwiche, Jalal Alameddine, Bassam Said and Tony Haddad, including a photograph of the group taken while they were at McDonalds. 

4. Call charge records and evidence of telephone numbers, showing telephone contact between El-Zeyat and Bassam Said just before the time of the shooting and two to three minutes after the time of the shooting. 

5. Evidence of possession by Aouad of a hooded jacket. 

6. Evidence by Donna Fahda, the former wife of Aouad, that Aouad had possession of Glock pistols of the type which, according to the ballistics evidence, had been used to shoot Ahmed Fahda. 

THE DEFENCE CASES 

156A number of the Crown witnesses, and particularly Bassam Said, Tony Haddad, Wahib Hannouf and Haissam Hannouf, were cross-examined at length so as to bring out before the jury the extent of their criminal activities, the benefits they had received from co-operating with the authorities, the conflicts and omissions in the various accounts they had given and the opportunities they had had to jointly concoct untrue versions of events. 

157Neither of the appellants gave evidence and Adnan Darwiche did not give evidence. No witness was called to give evidence in the defence case of El-Zeyat. 

158Two witnesses were called in the defence case of Aouad. A private investigator gave evidence of certain time trials, that is of the times it had taken the investigator to travel by car or on foot along some of the routes which, according to the Crown witnesses, they had taken on 30 October 2003. A ballistics expert gave evidence about Glock pistols. It was not suggested at the hearing of these appeals that the evidence of either of these witnesses had any significance. 

GROUNDS OF APPEAL 

159Ultimately, after leave had been granted by the court to amend certain grounds of appeal or raise further grounds of appeal, the appellant Aouad relied on six grounds of appeal against conviction and the appellant El-Zeyat relied on four grounds of appeal against conviction. 

160Aouad's first ground of appeal and El-Zeyat's first ground of appeal raised substantially similar issues and can conveniently be dealt with together. 

161Aouad's second ground of appeal was by its very nature specific to Aouad's appeal and there was no corresponding ground of appeal by El-Zeyat. Aouad's third ground of appeal, which related to the admission into evidence at the trial of informal admissions made by El-Zeyat, being evidence which was clearly admissible against El-Zeyat, was abandoned by Aouad. Aouad's fourth ground of appeal related to certain conduct by his former wife Donna Fahda in giving evidence at the trial and there was no corresponding ground of appeal by El-Zeyat. 

162Aouad's fifth ground of appeal and El-Zeyat's second ground of appeal raised substantially similar issues and can conveniently be dealt with together, as is the case with Aouad's sixth ground of appeal and El-Zeyat's fifth and sixth grounds of appeal. 

AOUAD - GROUND OF APPEAL 1 

1. The trial judge erred in directing the jury as to the approach they were entitled to take in considering the evidence of the witnesses who might reasonably be regarded as criminally concerned in the crimes alleged against the appellant and, in particular, by directing the jury that the evidence of any one 'indemnified witness' may be considered as providing support for the evidence of another. 

1(b) The trial judge erred in directing the jury that it was open to the jury 'to have regard to the evidence of one or more indemnified witnesses as providing some support for an acceptance of the evidence of another of the indemnified witnesses'. 

EL-ZEYAT - GROUND OF APPEAL 1 

1 The trial judge erred in directing the jury that the evidence of any one ""indemnified witness"" may be considered as providing support for the acceptance of the evidence of another of the ""indemnified witnesses"". 

163Counsel for Aouad informed the Court that ground 1(b) did not raise any ground independent of ground 1. Ground 1(b) had been added to the grounds of appeal, merely for the purpose of basing the first ground of appeal on the precise words the trial judge had used in her summing-up. 

164Ground 1 in Aouad's appeal refers both to witnesses who might reasonably be regarding as criminally concerned in the crime alleged against the appellant and to indemnified witnesses. Ground 1 in El-Zeyat's appeal refers only to indemnified witnesses. 

165The witnesses at the trial who had been indemnified were Tony Haddad, Wahib Hannouf, Haissam Hannouf and Khaled Taleb. Bassam Said was not an indemnified witness. 

166Suggestions were made at the trial that the two Hannouf brothers might have been criminally concerned in the murder of Ahmed Fahda. However, there would not appear to have been any evidence (apart from evidence of possible motive), and on the appeal this Court was not directed to any actual evidence, as distinct from suggestions made in cross-examination, that the Hannouf brothers were or might have been criminally concerned in the murder. No suggestion was made at the trial that Bassam Said, Tony Haddad or Khaled Taleb might have been criminally concerned in the murder. 

167The appellants' grounds of appeal were based on a passage in the trial judge's summing-up. The trial judge had been referring to the evidence of the Hannouf brothers, Khaled Taleb, Tony Haddad and Bassam Said. Her Honour noted that they were all persons of bad character with a history of serious criminality. Her Honour continued: 

""Plainly members of the jury, there is a need for you to exercise great care in assessing the evidence of each of these witnesses. You look at whether the evidence impressed you as credible. Whether it is consistent in the case of each witness with accounts that he has previously given, plainly you would look for independent support in considering whether you accepted the evidence of one or more of these witnesses. 

It is open to you to have regard to the evidence of one or more of the indemnified witnesses as providing some support for an acceptance of the evidence of another of the indemnified witnesses. As your own commonsense would suggest, you need to approach that exercise with a degree of care. Tony Haddad and Bassam Said are persons with a close association that includes their willingness to engage in serious criminal activities together. Each was suspected by the police of having been an accessory after the fact to the murder of Ahmed Fahda. To the extent that their accounts may seem to coincide, you would assess whether they have had the opportunity to collude and agree upon an account to put forward to the police that serves to exculpate them."" 

168At the trial there was no complaint from trial counsel for either appellant (or from counsel for the other accused Darwiche) about this part of the trial judge's summing up. Accordingly, r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies. Nor was there any request pursuant to s 165 of the Evidence Act for any further direction. 

169The history of the written submissions of the appellants in support of this ground is somewhat involved. Written submissions dated 6 December 2007 were lodged on behalf of El-Zeyat. These submissions had been prepared by the late Mr Paul Byrne of senior counsel. 

170Written submissions were subsequently lodged on behalf of Aouad. In these submissions it was stated Aouad adopted and relied upon the submissions made on behalf of El-Zeyat. This was apparently a reference to the submissions which had been prepared by Mr Byrne. However, in submissions subsequently lodged on behalf of El-Zeyat it was stated that the submissions of 6 December 2007 were withdrawn and that new submissions were being made. 

171In the course of the hearing it became clear that the appellants did wish to rely on Mr Byrne's submissions, as well as further submissions. 

172The written submissions prepared by Mr Byrne were not really submissions but a survey by Mr Byrne of English and Australian cases on the subject of ""mutual corroboration of accomplices"". A number of cases surveyed by Mr Byrne were referred to frequently in further written and oral submissions on the appeal. These cases included Pollitt v The Queen (1991-1992) 174 CLR 558; R v Chen & Ors (2002) 130 A Crim R 300; R v Ngo [2003] NSWCCA 82 (reported in part at (2003) 57 NSWLR 55); Conway v The Queen (2001) 209 CLR 203; Kanaan & Ors v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 109. 

173In Pollitt the Crown case was that Pollitt and an accomplice named Jones had been recruited to kill one man but had mistakenly killed another man. At the trial Jones gave evidence in the Crown case and a prisoner informer named Denning gave evidence of a confession he said Pollitt had made to him while both Pollitt and Denning were in prison. 

174The trial judge gave a direction that Denning's evidence, if accepted, was capable of corroborating the evidence of the accomplice Jones. It was submitted on the appeal that the witnesses Jones and Denning could not corroborate each other. 

175At pp 599-600 Dawson J and Gaudron J said in their joint judgment: 

""It is convenient first to consider the argument that Denning and Jones could not corroborate each other. Leaving aside the special problems associated with the unsworn evidence of children (which, of course, are not involved in this case) and the position with respect to the evidence of accomplices, there is no rule of law or practice that evidence which attracts a corroboration warning cannot corroborate or be corroborated by other evidence attracting the same warning. 

The rule that one accomplice cannot corroborate another is based in large part on the common interest of accomplices in minimizing their involvement in the offence charged. That common interest raises the possibility that they may have conspired to give an identical but false account. It is for this reason that a direction is given that accomplices cannot corroborate each other. Thus, if there is no possibility of joint fabrication, as, for example, where the witness was an accomplice in other offences and is called to give similar fact evidence, a direction to this effect is not required. Equally, there may be cases not involving accomplices where, because of the possibility of joint fabrication, it is necessary to direct a jury to look elsewhere for corroboration. But there was no basis for any suggestion of joint fabrication in this case and, thus, there was no need for a direction that Denning and Jones could not corroborate each other."" 

176In R v Chen the appellants had been charged with importing a commercial quantity of heroin in contravention of the Customs Act . A man named Chan who had been a member of the criminal enterprise gave evidence for the Crown. At para 58 of its judgment the Court of Criminal Appeal said: 

""In our opinion, Chan was plainly an accomplice. Though s 164(3) of the Evidence Act abolished the universal common law duty to give an accomplice warning, the power and the duty to do so in appropriate circumstances survives: see also s 165(5). It became, therefore, incumbent upon the learned presiding judge to give the jury a clear direction to the effect that it would be dangerous to convict the appellant, and his other co-accused, upon the uncorroborated evidence of that accomplice. This, as it seems to us, his Honour plainly and correctly did. ..."" 

177In R v Ngo the Court at para 179 of its judgment quoted part of the joint judgment of Dawson and Gaudron JJ in Pollitt at p 600 and at paras 187 and 188 referred with approval to what had been said at para 58 of the judgment in Chen . 

178In Conway v The Queen , Conway was charged with the murder of his wife. It was alleged by the Crown that he had instigated two men to inject his wife with a fatal dose of heroin. The two men gave evidence for the Crown at Conway's trial. The Commonwealth Evidence Act , which was in similar terms to the New South Wales Evidence Act , applied to the trial. 

179The trial judge gave the jury a direction that it would be dangerous to convict Conway of the evidence of the two men, who were accomplices, unless the evidence was corroborated. The trial judge directed the jury that a large number of matters were capable of amounting to corroboration. On the appeal it was conceded by the Crown or found by the Court, that some of these matters were not capable of amounting to corroboration. 

180The High Court held that ss 164 and 165 of the Evidence Act did not prohibit a judge from warning a jury that it would be dangerous to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice. The High Court further held that, although the jury had been misdirected about what evidence was capable of constituting corroboration, no substantial miscarriage of justice had resulted, because the evidence against the accused was overwhelming. 

181Kanaan & Ors v Regina featured prominently in the submissions of the parties on the hearing of the present appeal. 

182In Kanaan the head of a criminal organisation had been murdered. The Crown alleged that the persons who became appellants in the Court of Criminal Appeal had been parties to a joint criminal enterprise to kill the deceased. 

183The Crown case depended principally on the evidence of a witness who had been a member of the same criminal organisation and who might reasonably have been supposed to have been criminally concerned in the joint criminal enterprise. This witness was given the pseudonym of Rossini. The witness was given an undertaking by the Attorney General that, provided that the evidence he gave was true, his evidence would not be used against him. 

184The Crown case also depended, to a lesser extent, on the evidence of two brothers who might reasonably have been supposed to have been accessories after the fact to the murder. The two brothers were given the pseudonym ""Laycock"". 

185In Kanaan the trial judge did not direct the jury that it would be dangerous to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice. The trial judge did direct the jury that they could find ""support"" for the evidence of Rossini in the evidence of the Laycock brothers. The Court of Criminal Appeal held that the trial judge had not erred in either respect. 

186The High Court refused special leave to appeal from the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Kanaan ((2007) HCA transcript 402 (3 August 2007)). In refusing special leave the Chief Justice said that the Court was of the view that there were insufficient prospects of the appeals succeeding to grant special leave. 

187Parts of the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Kanaan which were particularly referred to on the present appeal were parts of the judgment between paras [202] and [224]. 

188In para [205] the Court noted a submission by the appellants as follows: 

""The appellants' next submission supporting Ground 3 is that it was incumbent on the judge in this case to direct the jury that, as Rossini was an accomplice, it was dangerous to convict the accused on his uncorroborated evidence, to give the jury assistance as to the nature of corroborative evidence and to identify what evidence there was which, if accepted, could constitute corroborative evidence in this case. Reliance was placed on the decisions of this Court in Regina v Chen and Regina v Ngo."" 

189In para 206 of the Judgment the Court referred to para [58] in the judgment of the Court in Chen . In para 207 the Court set out the provisions of the Evidence Act . The Court commenced para 208 by referring to paras [187]-[188] of the judgment of the Court in Ngo . The Court then proceeded to point out that in neither Chen nor Ngo had any reference been made to the decision of the High Court in Conway , which had been handed down before the decisons in Chen and Ngo were given. 

190In paras [216]-[217] of its Judgment in Kanaan the Court said: 

""216 In the circumstances that - 

(i) Conway v The Queen explicitly states that a common law accomplice warning that it is dangerous to convict is not necessary, although it is permissible, 

(ii) the need for corroboration for any evidence (except in relation to trials of perjury or a similar or related offence) has been abolished by s 164, unless some other provision of the Evidence Act required it, and 

the terminology of the common law accomplice direction is not imported into the accomplice warning to be given pursuant to s 165(2) (as we have asserted in par [214] supra - 

it is, with due respect, not possible to agree with this Court's decisions in Chen and Ngo , and to some extent with the decision in Livingstone , that the necessity for such a direction (or the duty to give such a direction) has survived 'in appropriate circumstances'. 

217 In our view, the effect of ss 164-165 (as now interpreted by the High Court) is as follows: 

(1) It is not necessary for the evidence of a witness who may reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the trial to be corroborated. 

The judge, if requested to do so and unless of opinion that there are good reasons not to do so, is: 

(a)to give a warning that the evidence of that witness may be unreliable, 

(b)to inform the jury of matters that may cause it to be unreliable, and 

(c)to warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it. 

(3) The matters to which reference was generally made in directions which accompanied the common law accomplice warning should, when appropriate, generally be used when informing the jury of the matters which may cause the evidence of that witness to be unreliable. 

(4) The Judge may, if satisfied that it is necessary in the interests of justice to do so in the particular case, give a warning that it would be dangerous to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of such a witness, but the judge is never under a duty to do so."" 

191In paras [219], [220] and [221] the Court said: 

""219 The appellants' final submission in support of Ground 3 is that the judge wrongly directed the jury that they could find 'support' for the evidence of Rossini in the evidence of the Laycock brothers. Reliance is placed on Pollitt v The Queen (1992) 174 CLR 588 at 600, where the rule that one accomplice cannot corroborate another was said to have been based in large part on the common interests of accomplices in minimising their involvement in the offence charged. That common interest raises the possibility that they may have conspired to give an identical but false account. For the reasons already given (in par [202] supra ), the Laycocks as accessories after the fact were not accomplices. Nor was there any requirement that Rossini's evidence be corroborated. 

220. The High Court in Pollitt also said (at 600) that corroboration could not be given of the evidence of an accomplice where there was the possibility of joint fabrication by the accomplice with the other witness. There was such a possibility of joint fabrication between Rossini and the Laycock brothers. It would therefore have been an error if the judge had directed the jury that the evidence of the Laycock brothers could corroborate that of Rossini. He did not do so. His instruction to the jury was that they should look 'to see to what extent there is any independent support' for the evidence Rossini had given. That direction did not invite the jury to equate independent support with corroboration. 

221 The words 'independent support' have a far wider meaning than 'corroboration', and therefore 'support' need not be of such a nature that it confirms in some material particular not only that the crime has been committed but also that the accused committed it: cf Rex v Baskerville (1916) 2 KB 658 at 665, 668. Provided that the jury is adequately warned that the evidence of a witness who may have fabricated a story jointly with the 'accomplice' may be unreliable for that reason when looking for support in that witness's evidence of the evidence given by the 'accomplice', there is no reason why the jury may not look for support in such evidence.' 

192The decision in Kanaan was handed down on 13 April 2006 during the trial of the appellants. The decision was drawn to the trial judge's attention and her Honour's directions in her summing up were clearly based on Kanaan . 

193On the present appeal counsel for Aouad submitted that the trial judge had erred in directing the jury that it was open to them to have regard to the evidence of one or more of the indemnified witnesses for support for the evidence of another indemnified witness. 

194It was submitted that all of the witnesses Bassam Said, Tony Haddad, Wahib Hannouf and Haissam Hannouf were ""unreliable"" witnesses and that the jury could look for support for the evidence of one of those witnesses in the evidence of another of those witnesses, only if the evidence of the other witness was truly independent of the evidence of the first witness and the evidence of the other witness would not be truly independent, unless the possibility of the two witnesses having jointly concocted their evidence was excluded. Counsel referred to Pollitt at p 600. 

195A further submission was made that in the part of the trial judge's summing up which I have quoted the trial judge directed the jury that they should assess whether the witnesses Bassam Said and Tony Haddad had had the opportunity to collude and agree upon their accounts but did not give a similar direction about whether other pairs of the unreliable witnesses had had the opportunity to jointly fabricate their evidence. 

196Counsel for Aouad accepted that the judgment of this Court in Kanaan appeared to present some difficulties for his submissions. Counsel did not submit that Kanaan had been wrongly decided but did suggest that Kanaan had been ""misunderstood"". 

197Counsel submitted that the passage in the joint judgment in Pollitt at p 600 had continuing significance, notwithstanding the subsequent introduction of the Evidence Act and the judgment of this Court in Kanaan . 

198Counsel acknowledged that leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules was required to rely on this ground, because there had been no objection to her Honour's direction at the trial, but submitted that leave should be granted. 

199Counsel for El-Zeyat made the same principal submission as counsel for Aouad, that is that the jury could look for support for the evidence of one of the unreliable witnesses in the evidence of another of those witnesses but only if the evidence of the other witness was truly independent and the evidence of the other witness would not be truly independent if there was a possibility that the evidence of the two witnesses had been jointly concocted. 

200A submission was made by counsel for El-Zeyat that ""corroboration evidence"" is a species of the genus ""supporting evidence"" and, if evidence cannot amount to corroboration because of a possibility of joint concoction, it cannot amount to independent support, if there is a possibility of joint concoction. 

201It was submitted that the unreliable witnesses in the present case had in fact had an opportunity to jointly concoct their evidence, while they were in prison together. 

202Counsel for El-Zeyat's submissions about the judgment of this Court in Kanaan varied. No submission that Kanaan had been wrongly decided had been made in counsel's written submissions. In oral submissions it was submitted that Kanaan had been ""misconceived"" and ""misapplied"". Later in counsel's oral submissions it was submitted that the distinction drawn in Kanaan between evidence which is corroboration and evidence which is independent support is fallacious. At one stage in oral submissions an outright submission was made that Kanaan had been wrongly decided. 

DECISION 

203The direction by the trial judge which is challenged was a direction which literally applied only to the indemnified witnesses. Bassam Said was not an indemnified witness. However, he was referred to in this part of the summing up and the jury could well have understood that Bassam Said was included among the witnesses whose evidence might receive or provide support. 

204In my opinion, the submissions of counsel for the appellants sought to confer on the passage in the joint judgment of Dawson and Gaudron JJ in Pollitt at p 600 a significance for the present appeals, which the passage cannot properly bear. 

205Pollitt was a case decided at common law before the introduction of the Evidence Act , in the special context of the common law rules about the corroboration of evidence of accomplices. The Evidence Act and particularly ss 164 and 165 made radical changes to the common law rules about the corroboration of evidence of accomplices. 

206In any event, none of the allegedly unreliable witnesses was an ""accomplice"" or a person who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the murder (s 165(1)(d) of the Evidence Act ). Although Bassam Said at one stage was charged by police with having been an accessory after the fact to the murder, it was not suggested at the trial that he had been criminally concerned in the murder. Nor was it suggested at the trial that Tony Haddad had been criminally concerned in the murder. Some questions were put in cross-examination to the Hannouf brothers with a view to showing that they might have been criminally concerned in the murder but they denied the suggestions put to them. No application was made at the trial that a direction pursuant to s 165 of the Evidence Act should be given on the basis that a witness might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the murder. 

207The passage in the joint judgment at p 600 of Pollitt makes clear that, apart from the two special cases mentioned, there was no general rule of law or practice at common law that evidence which required a corroboration warning could not be corroborated by other evidence requiring the same warning. 

208The only part of the joint judgment which lends any support to counsel for the appellants' submissions is the dictum that there ""may"" be cases not involving accomplices where, because of the possibility of joint fabrication, it is necessary to direct the jury to look elsewhere for corroboration. This dictum does not provide an adequate foundation for this Court to create a rule of law that, if two witnesses are ""unreliable"" (seemingly for whatever reason) the jury cannot look for support for the evidence of one witness in the evidence of the other witness, unless the possibility of joint concoction is excluded (seemingly beyond reasonable doubt). 

209As was acknowledged by counsel for both appellants, the decision of this Court in Kanaan presents serious difficulties for their submissions. As I have already noted, counsel for El-Zeyat made a submission at one stage that Kanaan had been wrongly decided. 

210In my opinion, this Court should accept Kanaan as having been correctly decided. It is a recent unanimous decision of this Court and the High Court refused special leave to appeal on the ground that the proposed appeal had insufficient prospects of succeeding. As pointed out in Kanaan , what was said in the earlier decisions of this Court in Chen and Ngo was said in apparent ignorance of the decision of the High Court in Conway . No notice was given in the written submissions for either appellant that it would be submitted that Kanaan had been wrongly decided and, accordingly, the present Bench consists of only three judges. 

211In Kanaan this Court held that there is a distinction between ""corroboration"" and ""independent support"", that independent support is wider than corroboration, that in order for evidence to be independent support it need not comply with the stringent requirements for evidence to be corroboration at common law and that a jury may look for support for the evidence of one witness in the evidence of another witness, notwithstanding the possibility that witnesses might have fabricated their evidence jointly, provided that the jury receives adequate warnings. In my opinion, these holdings undermine the submission made by counsel for each appellant that the trial judge erred in directing the jury that it was open to them to have regard to the evidence of one or more of the indemnified witnesses for support for the evidence of another indemnified witness. Contrary to the submission made by counsel for El-Zeyat, there is no logical difficulty in holding that evidence which does not satisfy a requirement for corroboration at common law may nevertheless be available as support for the evidence of another witness. 

212There was, indeed, little factual basis for a submission that the Hannouf brothers on the one hand and Bassam Said on the other hand had jointly concocted their evidence. The Hannouf brothers had made comprehensive statements to the police months before they and Bassam Said came to be imprisoned in the same correctional centre. 

213In Kanaan the court qualified its statement about the availability of the evidence of one witness as support for the evidence of another witness, notwithstanding the possibility that the evidence of the two witnesses might have been jointly fabricated, by saying that adequate warnings should be given to the jury by the trial judge. 

214It is true that the trial judge in the summing up warned about the possibility of joint concoction only as between Bassam Said and Tony Haddad and not as between other pairs of the witnesses the reliability of whose evidence was challenged. However, her Honour gave extensive general warnings about the evidence of these witnesses and the need to ""pay special attention"" and ""to exercise great care"" in assessing their evidence. Her Honour explicitly raised the possibility of joint concoction between Bassam Said and Tony Haddad. The subject having been raised, it could hardly have escaped the jury's attention that there was a possibility of joint concoction between other pairs of the witnesses, for example, between the two Hannouf brothers. 

215No application was made at the trial for any further direction and r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules is applicable. I do not consider that the fact that the trial judge did not give any more extensive directions than she did gave rise to any miscarriage of justice. 

216I would refuse leave under r 4 in respect of Aouad's first ground of appeal (including ground 1(b)) and El-Zeyat's first ground of appeal. 

AOUAD - GROUND OF APPEAL 2 

The trial judge erred in admitting into evidence a comfit identification of the appellant by the witness referred to at trial as Michael Rahman. 

217Earlier in this judgment I summarised the evidence of the witness referred to at the trial as Michael Rahman about what he observed at the service station on the afternoon of 30 October 2003. I mentioned that Mr Rahman had participated in the preparation of a comfit image of the man described in his evidence as ""the first man"" and had looked at two series of photographs for the purpose of making a photographic identification of the first man. On the Crown case ""the first man"" was Aouad. 

218On 30 October 2003 Mr Rahman made a statement to police in which he gave a description of the first man. In the statement he described the first man as having a goatee beard, as being about 170cm tall, as being of Middle Eastern appearance, as looking to be in his mid-twenties and as wearing a hooded top. This description was generally consistent with the appearance of Aouad. 

219On 30 October 2003 Mr Rahman completed what is known as a comfit request form relating to the first man. However, no comfit image of that man was generated on 30 October 2003. 

220On 7 January 2004 Mr Rahman was shown a display of photographs of young men, which did not include a photograph of Aouad. Mr Rahman selected three photographs which he said bore some similarity to the first man. 

221On 9 March 2004 Mr Rahman completed another comfit request form for the first man. There were some changes and additions in this request form. 

222A forensic imaging technician named Fleming, using the information supplied by Mr Rahman in both comfit request forms, then prepared a comfit image of the first man. 

223On 1 April 2004 Mr Rahman was interviewed by police. He was shown two computer presentations of photographs of young men of Middle Eastern appearance. The first presentation included a photograph of Aouad (No 8). Mr Rahman selected photographs 1, 3, 8 and 17 as being photographs of persons similar to the first man. The photograph of Aouad which was included in the first computer presentation had been taken on 7 December 2003. 

224The Crown gave notice before the trial that it would seek to tender at the trial evidence relating to the comfit image and its preparation and evidence relating to the showing or presentation of the photographs to Mr Rahman. Aouad's legal representatives informed the Crown that the admission into evidence of these two bodies of evidence (or parts of them) would be opposed. A voir dire enquiry was held before the commencement of the trial to determine the admissibility of these two bodies of evidence. After the conclusion of the voir dire enquiry the trial judge made rulings that both bodies of evidence were admissible. 

225Subsequently, on 19 April 2006, after the trial itself had commenced, her Honour delivered written reasons for her rulings. Her Honour's judgment has been reported R v Darwiche & Ors (2006) 166 A Crim R 28. 

226Consequentially upon her Honour's rulings, evidence relating to the comfit image and to the photographs was given at the trial. 

227No appeal was brought from her Honour's ruling that the photographic evidence was admissible. 

228It is convenient now to refer to parts of the trial Judge's judgment of 19 April 2006. In her judgment the trial judge referred to Mr Rahman as ""Mr Delaney"". 

229In para 4 of her judgment her Honour summarised the evidence which had been given in the voir dire enquiry by Mr Fleming about comfit procedure as follows: 

""Evidence was give by Mr Fleming, an imaging technician with the New South Wales Police, about com-fit request forms and the production of com-fit images. A com-fit booklet contains computer images depicting different types of human faces and facial features, including eyes, mouths, noses and hair types. Each component in the com-fit booklet is identified by a letter and a number. An identifying witness is asked to select the features that most closely resemble the suspect from the booklet and to record the component numbers for each feature on a com-fit request form. Provision is made on the form for the witness to describe hair colour, complexion, ethnic appearance and other distinguishing features. The com-fit request form is then given to an imaging technician who produces a computer generated com-fit image, a process that involves merging the selected component features to produce a composite image of a human face."" 

230In paras 40-48 of the judgment her Honour said: 

""40. I turn now to a consideration of the basis of the challenge to the evidence relating to the production of the com-fit computer image. 

41. Mr Segal objected to the admission of the com-fit image as hearsay submitting that it did not come within any of the exclusions to the hearsay rule. 

42. At common law evidence of an identikit picture has been received in evidence on an analysis that, unlike an out of court statement in writing, the pictorial representation is not hearsay: R v Cook [1987] 1 QB 417 at 425 per Watkins LJ (delivering the judgment of the court): 

'We regard the production of the sketch or photo fit by a police officer making a graphic representation of a witness's memory as another form of camera at work, albeit imperfectly and not produced contemporaneously with the material incident but soon or fairly soon afterwards. As we perceive it the photo fit is not a statement in writing made in the absence of a defendant or anything resembling it in the sense that this very old rule against hearsay has ever been expressed to embrace. It is we think sui generis, that is to say, the only one of its kind. It is a thing apart, the admissibility to evidence of which would not be in breach of the hearsay rule.' 

43. In R v Sparkes (1996) 6 Tas R 178; 88 A Crim R 194 Underwood J reviewed the authorities at common law on the admission of identikit pictures. His Honour noted the cautionary commentary in Cross on Evidence (5 th Aust ed, 1996) p 876 - that the reasoning in Cook is not so strong in principle that it will inevitably be applied in Australia and that there are hearsay dangers in relation to photo fit pictures that do not apply to photographs - but determined to admit the photo fit following the reasoning in Cook . 

44. Mr Delaney's evidence that the com-fit image resembles shooter No 1 is evidence of identification for the purposes of the Act. Mr Segal did not submit that it is inadmissible by reason of the provisions of s 114. For the reasons earlier given, I was not of the opinion that Mr Delaney's identification evidence is excluded by s 114, since I am satisfied that the accused had refused to take part in an identification parade prior to 9 March 2004. 

45. Mr Segal did not challenge the evidence of the representations made by Mr Delaney on 9 March 2004 to Detective Hamilton and to Mr Fleming of the selection of the component features from the comfit booklet or of his identification of the com-fit image as resembling shooter No 1. The matter was argued on the basis that Mr Delaney's representations were first hand hearsay (T 670). The Crown Prosecutor submitted that the representations were admissible under s 66(2). There was no issue taken about whether the occurrence of the asserted fact was fresh in Mr Delaney's memory at the time the representations were made for the purposes of s 66(2). In the Crown's submission the interval of four months and nine days between the shooting and the date on which the com-fit image was made did not exclude Mr Delaney's representations made on that day being fresh in the memory. I considered that Mr Delaney's identification, comprising the selection of the component features from the com-fit booklet and assertion that the com-fit image resembled shooter no 1, to be admissible as original evidence of his state of mind and analogous to the out of court identification of a photograph: R v Barbaro [2000] NSWCCA 192; (2000) 112 A Crim R 551 per Grove J (with whose judgment Spigelman CJ and Wood CJ at CL agreed) at [43]. In the event that I was wrong in so concluding, I record that although the interval of over four months was lengthy (having regard to the observations in Graham v R (1998) 195 CLR 606) I considered that the assertions contained in the com-fit request form that appears to have been completed by Mr Delaney on the day of the shooting in combination with the assertions made by him on 9 March 2004 supported the conclusion that the image of shooter no. 1 was still fresh in his memory on 9 March. 

46. Mr Segal's objection was to the admission into evidence of the com-fit image, which he contended was ""one step away"" from the representations made by Mr Delaney to Detective Hamilton and Mr Fleming. In his submission the com-fit image is an artefact produced by a skilled operator using technology and is excluded by the hearsay rule (T 670). That rule excludes evidence of a previous representation made by a person to prove the existence of a fact that the person intended to assert by the representation: s 59. The com-fit image is not tendered to prove any fact intended to be asserted by Mr Fleming. The com-fit image is a graphic representation of Mr Delaney's mental image of shooter No. 1. Accepting that Mr Delaney's identification of the com-fit image (that it closely resembles shooter No 1) is admissible, I considered that the com-fit image is admissible; much in the way that a photograph identified by a witness on an earlier occasion is admissible. 

47. Mr Segal submitted that the com-fit image should be excluded under s 137 of the Act. He laid stress on its near photographic quality, which he submitted was likely to have persuasive power that a sketch may not possess. In his submission there existed a danger that the jury would place too much emphasis on an image, which at best is a computer generated likeness based on the instructions of a witness who had a fleeting opportunity to observe shooter no. 1 and whose observations were made under circumstances of some exigency. Shooter No. 1 was not known to Mr Delaney. Mr Segal submitted that the jury may be tempted to compare the accused with the image and to conclude that he resembles the man depicted. 

48. I did not consider the quality of the com-fit image to occasion unfair prejudice to the accused. It is plainly a computer-generated image. I accepted that jurors would compare the com-fit image with the accused and assess whether the accused resembles the image that was created at Mr Delaney's direction. There is nothing about the com-fit image that occasions prejudice to the accused beyond the circumstance that his facial features may be considered to be broadly consistent with it. The matters that Mr Segal addressed by way of criticism of Mr Delaney's ability to accurately recall the appearance of shooter no 1 are matters that will require directions concerning the special need for caution in assessing evidence of this character. I was not of the opinion that the probative value of the evidence of the com-fit image was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused."" 

231It is also necessary to refer to another part of her Honour's judgment, in which her Honour referred to s 115(5) of the Evidence Act in considering the admissibility of the photographic evidence. In para 34 of her Judgment her Honour said in part: 

""...I consider that the accused had refused to take part in an identification parade on 1 March and 29 March 2004, when on each occasion he was offered the opportunity to participate in one. The verb ""refuse"" is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary , 2nd ed, as ""to decline to take or accept (something offered or presented); to reject the offer (a thing)"". I consider that the accused declined to accept the offer to participate in an identification parade and that this constituted a refusal for the purposes of subs (5)(a). The fact that he indicated that if certain conditions were met he might take a different stance does not mean that the stance taken at the time the offer was made did not constitute a refusal."" 

232It is apparent from these parts of the trial Judge's judgment that counsel for Aouad at the trial objected to the admission into evidence of only the comfit image itself. Counsel did not object to the admission into evidence of representations made by Mr Rahman to Detective Hamilton or to Mr Fleming and did not object to Mr Rahman giving evidence that the comfit image which had been produced resembled the first shooter. 

233The ground on which counsel at the trial objected to the admission into evidence of the comfit image itself (apart from the objection based on s 137 of the Evidence Act ) was that it was ""one step away"" from the representations made by Mr Rahman and was an artefact produced by a skilled operator and should be excluded under the hearsay rule. 

234The trial judge held that Mr Rahman's evidence, comprising the selection of the component features from the comfit booklet and the assertion that the comfit image resembled the first shooter, was original, and not hearsay, evidence and, if this evidence was admissible (and its admissibility had not been disputed), then the comfit image itself was admissible. The comfit image was not being tendered to prove any fact intended to be asserted by Mr Fleming. 

235The trial judge did not need to decide whether, if any part of Mr Rahman's evidence was hearsay, it was nevertheless admissible under s 66(2) of the Evidence Act but did proceed to hold that, if the evidence was hearsay, it was admissible under s 66(2). Her Honour noted that no issue had been taken about whether the occurrence of any asserted fact was ""fresh"" in Mr Rahman's memory at the time he had made a representation asserting the fact. 

236In the ground of appeal the evidence which it is alleged that the trial judge erred in admitting is described as evidence of a ""comfit identification"". 

237On the hearing of the appeal the evidence which it was submitted that the trial judge had erred in admitting went far beyond the comfit image itself, which had been the only piece of evidence objected to by trial counsel, and extended to the representations Mr Rahman had made in completing the second comfit request form and the grounds on which it was submitted that the ""comfit identification"" evidence was inadmissible went beyond the grounds which had been taken before the trial judge. It was submitted that the ""comfit identification"" evidence was hearsay evidence and that it did not come within the exception to the hearsay rule in s 66(2) of the Evidence Act , because, when Mr Rahman had made representations about the appearance of the first man on 9 March 2004, the occurrence of the facts he was asserting was no longer ""fresh"" in his memory within the meaning given to the word ""fresh"" by the High Court in Graham v The Queen (1998) 195 CLR 666. It was submitted that the trial judge had wrongly ""conflated"" the representations made by Mr Rahman on 30 October 2003, when it was conceded that his memory of the occurrence of the asserted facts was fresh, and the representations made by him on 9 March 2004, more than four months later. 

238Although no ground of objection based on s 114 of the Evidence Act had been taken at the trial, it was submitted that the comfit identification evidence was ""visual identification evidence"" and was not admissible under s 114(2)(c) of the Evidence Act , because it was not the case that the appellant had refused to take part in an identification parade, as was held by her Honour in relation to both s 115(5)(a) and s 114(2)(c) of the Evidence Act . 

239It was submitted by the Crown that the comfit identification evidence was original evidence or, alternatively, if any part of the evidence, for example, evidence of representations made by Mr Rahman on 9 March 2004, was hearsay, it had been open to her Honour to find, after taking into account all the circumstances, that the evidence was ""fresh"". It was submitted that there was in fact little difference between the representations made by Mr Rahman on 30 October 2003 and on 9 March 2004. 

240It was submitted by the Crown that this Court should not entertain the ground of objection to the evidence based on s 114 of the Evidence Act and that, in any event, no part of the evidence was ""visual identification evidence"" within s 114. 

DECISION 

241It is useful, in my opinion, to examine the actual evidence given at the trial by the relevant witnesses. 

242Mr Fleming gave evidence that he was a forensic imaging technician. He gave general evidence about the process undertaken in the creation of a comfit image, which was similar to the evidence given in the voir dire enquiry which was summarised in the trial judge's judgment. 

243Mr Fleming identified the comfit booklet, which was tendered and admitted. He identified one comfit request form which he had received from Mr Rahman. He was not sure about another comfit request form which was shown to him but other evidence established that the document shown to him was the other comfit request form he had received from Mr Rahman. 

244Mr Fleming then identified an image as being ""the image I created from the description by the witness"". 

245Mr Fleming could not recall whether Mr Rahman wanted any modifications to the image Mr Fleming had produced on the basis of the information in the request forms but agreed that ""the image ... is one that the witness was satisfied with"". 

246The relevant evidence given by Mr Rahman at the trial was quite brief. He said that on two occasions he had given instructions to police about the facial features that should be included in an image to be created. He did not give any evidence about any particular representations he had made about what the facial features were. 

247The following question and answer occurred: 

Q. When you saw the final image how good a likeness was it to the first gunman that you saw? 
A. Well, I was happy with the image he created and it's like maybe 80 percent like the one I really saw in that incident."" 

248Mr Rahman then identified the image which had been created and the image was tendered and admitted into evidence. 

249The police officer Detective Hamilton gave evidence that he had gone with Mr Rahman to the Sydney Police Centre on 9 March 2004 for the purpose of preparing a comfit image. Detective Hamilton identified the comfit request form filled in on 9 March 2004. 

250The two comfit request forms of 30 October 2003 and 9 March 2004 were admitted into evidence. 

251The key part of Mr Rahman's evidence at the trial was his evidence that, when he saw the final image, ""I was happy with the image he created and it's like maybe 80 percent like the one I really saw in that incident."" 

252It seems to me that in that answer Mr Rahman was asserting that at the time he first saw the final image he had been ""happy"" with it and that at the time of giving evidence he considered that it was about 80 percent like the person he had seen. 

253Insofar as Mr Rahman was giving evidence of his state of mind at the time of giving evidence, I consider that the evidence was clearly original evidence and not hearsay evidence. Insofar as he was giving evidence of what had been his state of mind at the time of first seeing the final image, I consider that his evidence was also original evidence. 

254The latter conclusion is supported by part of the decision of this Court in R v Barbaro (2000) 112 A Crim R 55. It is true that in that case it was held that evidence by an observer of a previous out of court act of identification by a witness, although admissible at common law, is evidence of a ""previous representation"" by the witness within the meaning of that expression in the Evidence Act and is excluded by s 59 of the Evidence Act , unless it comes within one of the exceptions to the hearsay rule of exclusion. However, it was further held in Barbaro that the witness himself was not precluded from giving evidence of the previous act of identification. Such evidence would be original evidence of the witness's state of mind at the time of the act of identification (see especially at para 43 per Grove J). 

255If Mr Rahman's evidence that the image was similar to the person he had seen was admissible, the image itself and evidence about how the image had been produced became admissible. It would, however, seem to follow from Barbaro's case that the relatively unimportant evidence given by Mr Fleming, that Mr Rahman had been satisfied with the image, might have been hearsay. 

256The reasoning of Watkins LJ giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the English case of Cook , which is set out in the trial judge's judgment, is, as was recognised by Underwood J of the Supreme Court of Tasmania in Sparkes , open to doubt but, if accepted, would lend some support to the admissibility in the present case of the comfit image and the evidence relating to the comfit image. 

257As I have already indicated, no oral evidence of previous representations by Mr Rahman was given at the trial, apart from Mr Fleming's evidence that Mr Rahman was ""satisfied"" with the final image. 

258However, the two comfit request forms completed by Mr Rahman were admitted into evidence. These did contain representations by Mr Rahman that certain features of the person he had seen were like those depicted and identified by a letter and a number in the comfit booklet. These representations were previous representations made by Mr Rahman otherwise than in the course of giving evidence in the proceedings and came within s 59 of the Evidence Act . 

259It was conceded by counsel for Aouad on this appeal that the representations made in the comfit request form of 30 October 2003 were first hand hearsay and were made at a time when the asserted facts were fresh in the memory of Mr Rahman and therefore came within the exception to the hearsay rule in s 66(2) of the Evidence Act . 

260The representations made in the comfit request form of 9 March 2004 were not made until more than four months had elapsed since 30 October 2003. However, there was a great deal of similarity between the information provided in the two request forms. The information about the first man's eyes, nose and facial hair was identical in the two forms. The further information provided in the form of 9 March 2004 that the person had a goatee beard and was wearing a hooded jacket had been provided in the statement Mr Rahman made to police on 30 October 2003. In the form of 9 March 2004 Mr Rahman said that, apart from the goatee beard, the person had short hair but this would appear to be implicit in the information provided in the first form. 

261The respects in which the two request forms differed were that in the first form Mr Rahman described the first man as having a face like F25 in the comfit booklet, whereas in the second form Mr Rahman described the man as having a face ""between F14 and F25"" in the booklet (there are 43 different types of face shown in the booklet) and in the first form Mr Rahman described the first shooter as having a mouth like M21 in the booklet, whereas in the second form he initially wrote M21 again, then ruled it out and wrote M11 (there are 61 different types of mouth shown in the booklet). 

262In the circumstances, I consider that it was open to the trial judge to conclude, as she did, that the image of the first shooter was still ""fresh"" in the memory of Mr Rahman on 9 March 2004. 

263As I have already noted, no objection based on s 114 of the Evidence Act was made to the comfit evidence at the trial. In my opinion and notwithstanding an assertion made by the trial judge in para 44 of her judgment, the evidence was not identification evidence and therefore not ""visual identification evidence"". Mr Rahman was not asserting that Aouad was or resembled one of the shooters. He was merely asserting that some of the shooter's features were like certain features shown in the comfit booklet and that the comfit image resembled the shooter. 

264Alternatively, I do not consider that there was any error by her Honour in holding, for the reasons she gave, that Aouad had refused to take part in an identification parade within s 114(2)(c) of the Evidence Act . 

265In my opinion, this ground of appeal should be rejected. 

AOUAD - GROUND OF APPEAL 3 

266This ground of appeal was abandoned. 

AOUAD - GROUND OF APPEAL 4 

The trial judge erred in not discharging the jury after an outburst from the witness Donna Fahda (the sister of the deceased and ex-wife of the appellant). 

267There was no corresponding ground of appeal by El-Zeyat. 

268Donna Fahda, a sister of the deceased and the ex-wife of Aouad, gave evidence for the Crown at the trial on 1 May 2006. She gave evidence that she had become engaged to Aouad in June 2002 and had married him on 27 October 2002. She left him on a number of occasions and left him permanently in August 2003. 

269Donna Fahda gave evidence that, while she was engaged to Aouad and after their marriage, she had seen Aouad in possession of Glock pistols. A ballistics expert gave evidence at the trial that marks on fired cartridge cases collected from the garage indicated that the cartridges might have been discharged from a Glock or a Smith & Wesson pistol. A Smith & Wesson is basically a copy of a Glock. 

270After Donna Fahda had given this evidence, the trial judge directed the jury that the evidence was led for the limited purpose of showing that Aouad had access to firearms consistent with the firearm used to shoot Ahmed Fahda. 

271Donna Fahda was cross-examined by counsel for Aouad. The transcript records the following questions and answers. 

""Q. What I wanted to put to you is that on no occasion did the man Ramzi Aouad have possession of any pistols at all? 
A. Pardon? Okay, it must be that you are married to him, not me. You must share the house, not me. 

HER HONOUR: Q. One moment. Counsel is putting to you he did have a gun-- 
A. I saw it with my own eyes, I know my own eyes don't lie. He had a gun, he had two of them. He was shot with one of them. He shot the bloody bedroom, ask him, he knows that. 

(In response to a comment from the dock) You shut up."" 

272The trial judge directed Donna Fahda to confine herself to answering the questions she was asked. She was not in fact asked any further questions by any counsel. 

273On 4 May 2006, that is three days after Donna Fahda had given her evidence, counsel for Aouad made an application for a discharge of the jury on the grounds that the latter parts of the answer Donna Fahda had given on 1 May 2006 (""he was shot with one of them. He shot the bloody bedroom, ask him. He knows that"") were unresponsive to the question asked and prejudicial. The trial judge said that she would deal with the application later that day. 

274The trial judge decided not to discharge the jury and delivered a judgment giving her reasons. In her judgment she said of the unresponsive parts of the witness's answer: 

""... it seems to me that this evidence is capable of suggesting some misadventure that occurred in the bedroom of the premises involving the discharge of a Glock pistol and in which the accused suffered a bullet injury. It may be that there are other interpretations that can be put on it but it does not seem to me to be evidence tending to disclose that the accused has, on a previous occasion, used a pistol to shoot at another person or to threaten another person."" 

275In her judgment the trial judge noted that the evidence had been given on the fourteenth day of the trial and that the application for a discharge of the jury had been made on the seventeenth day of the trial. She referred to her power to give any further directions sought by counsel. No application was subsequently made that her Honour give any further directions. 

276On this appeal counsel for Aouad, while conceding that the trial judge was exercising a discretionary power in deciding whether or not to discharge the jury, submitted that the exercise of the discretion had miscarried. It was submitted that a more sinister interpretation of the unresponsive parts of Donna Fahda's answer was possible, that is that the witness was asserting that Aouad had shot the deceased with one of the two guns, that the witness's suggestion, ""ask him"", reversed the onus of proof and that the time in the trial at which the evidence was given and the delay in making the application for a discharge were irrelevant and should not have been taken into account in the exercise of the discretion. 

277The Crown submitted that a ground of appeal of this kind can be upheld, only if the Court of Criminal Appeal is of the view that the only course which had been open to the trial judge was to discharge the jury or where, with the benefit of hindsight, it can clearly be established that a miscarriage of justice arose because the jury was not discharged. The Crown cited R v El-Hayek [2004] NSWCCA 25 at [62] per Howie J. 

278It was submitted by the Crown that the interpretation of the unresponsive parts of the answer which was suggested by the trial judge in her judgment was clearly open, whereas the interpretation suggested by counsel for Aouad was strained. The trial judge accepted that there might be other interpretations open. In her summing up the trial judge gave strong directions about the criminal onus and standard of proof and an accused's right to silence. 

279It was submitted by the Crown that the fact that the trial had run for a number of days (and was likely to continue to run for a number of days) and the delay on the part of counsel in making the application for a discharge were factors which were relevant to the exercise of the discretion. 

280In my opinion, for the reasons given by her Honour in her judgment and by the Crown in its submissions, this Court should find that there was no error in the exercise of the trial judge's discretionary power and that the decision not to discharge the jury did not lead to any miscarriage of justice. 

281I would reject this ground of appeal. 

AOUAD - GROUND OF APPEAL 5 

EL-ZEYAT - GROUND OF APPEAL 2 

5(a) A miscarriage of justice resulted from the absence at trial of fresh evidence concerning a listening device recording the witness, Haissam Hannouf, speaking to another man on 31 December 2003. 

5(b) In the alternative, the trial miscarried as a result of the failure of police and prosecuting authorities to fully disclose material relevant to the credibility and tendency to violence of Haissam Hannouf. 

5(c) In the alternative, the trial miscarried as a result of the failure of the appellant's legal advisors to exercise due diligence by obtaining material relevant to the credibility and tendency to violence of Haissam Hannouf. 

282The evidence which it was submitted was fresh and the material which it was submitted was relevant to the credibility and tendency to violence of Haissam Hannouf was evidence of a conversation on 31 December 2003 between Haissam Hannouf and one of his other brothers Ahmed Hannouf. 

283In late 2003 Haissam Hannouf and others were suspected by police of taking part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug. A listening device was installed in an apartment pursuant to a warrant granted under the Listening Devices Act and a conversation on 31 December 2003 was recorded by means of this listening device. 

284A charge of knowingly taking part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug was brought against Haissam Hannouf and a Crown brief of evidence was served. The Crown brief included listening device warrants which had been granted but did not include a recording of the conversation of 31 December 2003 or any transcript of the conversation. 

285The charge of knowingly taking part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug was included in the indemnity granted to Haissam Hannouf and no trial of the charge ever took place. 

286The brief of evidence on the drug charge against Haissam Hannouf was served (together, of course, with many other documents) on the present appellants before their trial commenced. As I have already noted, the brief of evidence contained the listening device warrants but did not include any recording or any transcript of any conversation recorded by means of the listening devices. 

287In 2008 the criminal trial of a man named El-Jamal commenced in the Supreme Court before R S Hulme J and a jury. Haissam Hannouf gave evidence at this trial. During the trial the recording and a transcript of the conversation on 31 December 2003 were produced, in response to a call by Counsel for El-Jamal, and Haissam Hannouf was cross-examined about the conversation. 

288It would appear that the transcript of the conversation had only recently been prepared for the purpose of complying with the call made by El-Jamal's counsel. 

289In October 2008 Hulme J permitted access by Aouad's legal representatives to the transcript of Haissam Hannouf's evidence at the trial of El-Jamal. By perusing this transcript Aouad's legal representatives became aware of the recorded conversation of 31 December 2003. 

290In the conversation of 31 December 2003 Haissam Hannouf discussed with his brother Ahmed the obtaining of illicit drugs from a man who is referred to as being ""brother"". 

291In one part of the conversation Haissam Hannouf said: 

""(indistinct) in secret, because I don't want to end up doing my brother for the sake of money (indistinct) I'll shoot him straight out, I will shoot him, you know, I don't want it to reach to that because if I shoot him (indistinct)."" 

292In another part of the conversation Haissam Hannouf said: 

""(indistinct) don't tell me (indistinct) doesn't open his mouth (indistinct) we shoot him. 

... 

(indistinct) open his mouth (indistinct) I will shoot him (indistinct) we will reach that stage."" 

293At the trial of El-Jamal the audiovisual recording made on 31 December 2003 was played to Haissam Hannouf and he was asked questions about it. 

294In his evidence Haissam Hannouf said that he and his brother Ahmed had been obtaining tablets for the purpose of extracting pseudoephedrine from the tablets and sending the pseudoephedrine in powder form to a man named Mark. 

295In cross-examination on the first part of the conversation in which he referred to shooting, Haissam Hannouf said that in using the word ""shooting"" he was referring to guns and that the person he was talking about shooting was the man Mark. He said that he talked about shooting Mark ""not for the sake of money. If he didn't get his money, he is going to come after me, so I will shoot him too, back, like, in self defence, yes"". 

296In cross-examination about the second part of the conversation in which he referred to shooting, Haissam Hannouf said that the person he was talking about shooting was still Mark, ""If he opened his mouth to come after his money. He is a bikie, if he opens his mouth to the bikies, to someone to kill us"". 

297Further questions and answers in the cross-examination of Haissam Hannouf at El-Jamal's trial were: 

""Q, As at the thirty-first of December 2003 you were quite comfortable talking about a plan to shoot someone if you thought it was necessary, that's right? 
A. Self-defence for my life, yes. 

Q. And what you are talking about is shooting someone with a gun: 
A. Yes."" 

298It was submitted on behalf of the appellants that the recorded conversation showed that, at a time proximate to the murder of Ahmed Fahda (2 months afterwards), Haissam Hannouf was prepared to kill someone by shooting him with a gun. It was submitted that the conversation was of significant probative value and was relevant both to the credibility of Haissam Hannouf as a witness and to whether Haissam Hannouf might have been criminally concerned in the murder of Ahmed Fahda. Counsel submitted that the evidence of the conversation could be combined with evidence given at the trial, including evidence of a history of animosity between the Fahda family and the Hannouf family. 

299It was accepted by counsel for the appellants that at the trial there had been evidence of criminal conduct by Haissam Hannouf, including acts of violence and of possession of firearms and a readiness to use firearms, but at times remote from the time of the murder. Moreover, a number of suggestions of criminal conduct which were put to Haissam Hannouf in cross-examination at the trial had been denied by him and could not otherwise be established. 

300It was submitted that evidence of the conversation of 31 December 2003, had it been available at the trial, would have had a special value for the appellants, because the conversation had taken place within about 2 months of the shooting and, the conversation having been recorded, Haissam Hannouf, if the conversation had been put to him, would not have been able to deny it. 

301It was submitted by the Crown that the evidence of the conversation was not ""fresh"" evidence, because the service on the appellants' legal representatives of the Crown brief on the drug charge against Haissam Hannouf, by its inclusion of the listening device warrants, should have put the appellants on notice that there might have been conversations which had been recorded by means of the listening devices. 

302A submission more strongly relied on by the Crown was that the fresh evidence added little to the evidence which had been given at the trial and it was not the case that, if the fresh evidence had been before the jury, the jury would have been likely to have entertained a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the appellants. 

DECISION 

303It was common ground on the appeal that the principles to be applied by a Court of Criminal Appeal in considering a ground of appeal based on what is alleged to be fresh evidence were accurately stated by Kirby J in his judgment in R v Abou-Chabake (2004) 149 A Crim R 417 at 427-428(63). The sixth principle stated by Kirby J was as follows, applying where the evidence is not such as would entitle the appellant to an acquittal: 

""Sixth, where the evidence does not have that quality, or where a new trial is sought, a number of issues arise. The verdict will be quashed and a new trial ordered only where the following questions are answered affirmatively: 

Is the evidence fresh? 

If it is, is it ""credible"" or at least capable of belief ( Gallagher v The Queen (1986) 160 CLR 392 at 395; 20 A Crim R 244 at 246 per Gibbs CJ), or ""plausible"" ( Mickelberg v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 259 at 301; 43 A Crim R 182 at 210 per Toohey and Gaudron JJ)? 

If it is, would that evidence, in the context of the evidence given at the trial, have been likely to have caused the jury to have entertained a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused ( Gallagher v The Queen (at 410; 257) per Brennan J) or, if there is a practical difference, is there a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the accused ( Gallagher v The Queen (at 402; 251) per Mason and Deane JJ)? See Mickelberg v The Queen (at 301-302; 210-211) per Toohey and Gaudron JJ."" 

304I would reject the Crown's submission that the evidence should not be regarded as ""fresh"" evidence because the listening device warrants, but not the recordings or the transcript of any conversation, were included in the Crown brief on the drug trafficking charge against Haissam Hannouf, which was served on the appellants. There is no doubt that the evidence consisting of the recording of the conversation is credible. The determination of Part (a) of the ground of appeal therefore turns on the third question identified by Kirby J in Abou-Chabake , that is, if evidence of the conversation had been before the jury at the trial would it have been likely to have caused the jury to have entertained a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the appellants or whether there is a significant possibility that the jury acting reasonably would have acquitted the appellants. 

305I do not consider that, if the fresh evidence had been before the jury, the fresh evidence, in the context of the evidence that was given at the trial, would have been likely to have caused the jury to have entertained a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the appellants or that there is a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the appellants. 

306There was much evidence at the trial of the bad character of Haissam Hannouf, of his having access to guns and of his being prepared to use guns to shoot people including Ahmed Fahda. This evidence included the following evidence given in cross-examination: 

""Q. Didn't your family purchase guns, hand guns in the middle of 2001? 
A. Yes. 

Q. So that they could defend themselves against such an attack by Fahda or his associates, correct? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And or perhaps to strike at him and his associates before they had a chance to strike at you, correct? 
A. Inside the house, yes. 

Q. You weren't going to take the guns outside the house and shoot? 
A. No, if he is going to come and shoot us inside the house, then we have to defend ourselves. 

Q. These were legitimately obtained firearms were they? 
A. No. 

Q. What sort of guns were bought? 
A. My brothers got all the guns."" 

307After Haissam Hannouf said that he knew that his brothers were acquiring guns, the evidence continued: 

""Q. And you were prepared to use them if necessary? 
A. Yes. 

Q. The guns were to be used to strike at Mr Fahda and his associates before he got the chance to shoot at you or to injure your family? 
A. Yes. 

Q. In 2003 October of 2003 when you claimed to have seen him shot dead at the petrol station, he is still an enemy of your family, isn't he? 
A. Yes. 

Q. He is still someone that you harboured fear might do something of a serious nature to you or any member of your family? 
A. Yes."" 

308It is true that in this evidence Haissam Hannouf said that guns had been acquired in 2001, that is two years before the murder. However, he said that Ahmed Fahda had remained an enemy of the Hannouf family down to the time of the murder. 

309In my opinion, the fresh evidence that Haissam Hannouf was prepared to use guns to shoot some person other than the deceased, in self defence in the context of a drug deal, would have added little to the evidence before the jury, either as affecting the credibility as a witness of Haissam Hannouf or as showing that it was reasonably possible that he might have been criminally concerned in the murder. Accordingly, Part (a) of this ground of appeal should be rejected. 

310I would also reject Part (b) and Part (c) of this ground on the basis of what I consider to be the lack of significance of the evidence. The evidence in this case lacks the significance of the new evidence in Grey v The Queen (2000) 201 CLR 414, a case to which we were referred by counsel and to which I will refer in more detail later in this judgment. 

311Part (c) of this ground was not really pressed. It had been foreshadowed that affidavits might be obtained from Aouad's legal representatives at the time of the trial but no affidavits were ever filed. 

312In my opinion, all parts of Aouad's ground of appeal 5 and El-Zeyat's ground of appeal 2 should be rejected. 

AOUAD - GROUND OF APPEAL 6 

6. A miscarriage of justice resulted from the absence at trial of evidence concerning a conversation between Sheikh Taj Eldeen Alhilali and Bassam Said on 8 July 2004. 

6(b) In the alternative, the trial miscarried as a result of the failure of police and prosecuting authorities to disclose material concerning a conversation between Sheikh Taj Eldeen Alhilali and Bassam Said on 8 July 2004. 

EL-ZEYAT - GROUNDS OF APPEAL 5 AND 6 

5. A miscarriage of justice resulted from the absence at trial of fresh evidence concerning the conversation between Sheikh Taj Eldeen Alhilali and Bassam Said on 8 July 2004. 

6. A miscarriage of justice resulted from the failure of the police and prosecuting authorities to disclose material concerning the conversation between Sheikh Taj Eldeen Alhilali and Bassam Said on 8 July 2004. 

313It is apparent that grounds 6 and 6(b) of Aouad's appeal and grounds 5 and 6 of El-Zeyat's appeal are identical. 

314None of these grounds were originally grounds of appeal for either appellant. At the beginning of the hearing of the appeal on 29 June 2010 counsel for El-Zeyat gave notice that he might wish to raise a further ground of appeal based on a conversation between ""the Mufti"" (Sheikh Alhilali) and Bassam Said but needed to check some matters of fact before seeking to raise any further ground of appeal. 

315The principal hearing of the appeals took place on 29 June and 30 June. On 2 July counsel for El-Zeyat gave notice of an application for leave to add a further ground or grounds of appeal and on 9 July the Court made a grant of leave both to El-Zeyat and to Aouad. 

316It is clear from the transcript of the hearing on 9 July that the leave which the Court granted was limited to the grounds which I have set out above. On 13 July 2010 an amended notice of grounds of appeal was filed on behalf of El-Zeyat, which was in accordance with the leave which had been granted. On 9 July 2010 the Court directed that the parties file written submissions on the further grounds of appeal. The submissions which were filed on behalf of the appellant Aouad were properly limited to the grounds for which leave had been given. However, in the written submissions which were filed on behalf of the appellant El-Zeyat ground 6 was stated as being ""a miscarriage of justice resulted from the failure of the police and prosecuting authorities to disclose material concerning the events leading up to and including the obtaining of witness statements from Bassam Said (including his conversation with Sheikh Taj Eldeen Alhilali on 8 July 2004)"" and some of the submissions in the written submissions went beyond material concerning the conversation between Sheikh Taj Eldeen Alhilali and Bassam Said on 8 July 2004. 

317In my opinion, further leave should not be granted so as to permit the appellant El-Zeyat to rely on a ground of appeal in the terms of ground 6 in the written submissions filed on his behalf and the Court should not entertain such of the submissions as are not germane to the grounds of appeal for which leave was granted. 

318A number of affidavits were filed which are relevant to these grounds of appeal. There was no cross-examination of any of the deponents of these affidavits and no application to cross-examine any of the deponents. In these circumstances the Court should proceed on the basis that what is deposed to in the affidavits should be accepted as being true. 

319Sheikh Alhilali's affidavit of 1 July 2010, omitting formal parts and omitting paragraphs which were objected to and rejected by the Court or not pressed, was in the following terms: 

""1. As at October 2003 I was the Mufti of Australia (i.e. the most senior Islamic Jurist). 

2. I am currently the senior Imam at the Lakemba Mosque employed by the Lebanese Moslems Association. 

3. I am aware that a conversation I had with Bassam Said regarding the shooting of Ahmed Fahda is now relevant to criminal proceedings involving Naseam El-Zeyat. For that reason, I make this statement. 

4. Each of Bassam Said, Ahmed Fadha and Naseam El-Zeyat, and various members of their respective families, were known to me as at October 2003. 

5. I recall that at some time following the shooting of Ahmed Fahda, I was contacted by police officer Detective Tamer Kilani. That officer gave me his mobile telephone number, which I recorded in my notebook as (xxx). Detective Kilani is of Egyptian background I have known him and his family from when he was a young child. Detective Kilani asked to see me and indicated that he needed my assistance. 

6. Detective Kilani later came to my office and said to me that he and other officers were trying to gather information with respect to the Ahmed Fahda murder. At one stage in that conversation he said: ' the most importance witness in this case was Mr Bassam Said '. Detective Kilani also said that ' we need you because Mr Said is refusing to cooperate with the police '. 

9. I was contacted again by Detective Kilani. He told me that Bassam Said was being held in custody and asked me if I would go with him to speak with Bassam Said. He came to my office and took me with him in his car to where Bassam Said was being held. 

10. I am now advised that records show that this visit occurred on or about 8 July 2004. This accords with my recollection. I understand that this took place at the Long Bay gaol. My recollection as to precisely where I saw Bassam Said is not exactly clear, but accept that it occurred at the Long Bay gaol. I know that I have only met with Bassam Said once while he was in custody. 

11. When we arrived, I recall that both Detective Kilani and I entered a small room. Bassam Said then came into the room. I sat with him. I do not recall whether Detective Kilani remained in the room the whole time or not. 

12. I spoke in Arabic to Bassam Said and told him to the best of my recollection in words to the effect: ' First and foremost, the truth is the way to salvation. We do not want you to take sides with either group, we only want you to speak the truth and say what you actually saw with your own eyes '. 

13. I asked Bassam about the different groupings. He explained to me who he believed to be with the Darwiches and who were with the Fahdas and he mentioned a number of names, some of which I no longer recall. However, I do recall the name of Naseam El-Zeyat as being mentioned. 

14. He then explained to me: ' The police are saying that there was evidence that implicates Naseam El-Zeyat, however, I did not see Naseam '. 

15. I then said to him: ' It is absolutely crucial for you to say what you saw in order to clear your conscience and your slate before Allah '. 

16. He said to me: ' I swear father Sheikh, what I saw with my own eyes, I did say in my first statement. I assure you and I swear by Allah to you that I did not recognise the killers, I did not recognise anyone. However, the police do not believe me and they continue to insist and put pressure on me and ask me to confess that I recognise the killers. I did not see Naseam or anyone who is known to me. Had I seen Naseam, I would have said. They seem to think that I recognised the killers and that I am refusing to talk. My family and I are under pressure from everyone '. 

17. I then told Detective Kilani: "" Bassam has told the police the truth, he made a solemn oath to me that he did not recognise those who killed him '. 

19. Until now, I have never been asked about this conversation with Bassam Said and I have never told anyone about this conversation with Bassam Said. 

20. This affidavit has been interpreted to me at my office in the Lakemba Mosque."" 

320An investigation note created by Detective Kilani was in the following terms: 

""On 8 July 2004, the Mufti, Sheik Taj El-Hillaly and Detective Kilani attended the SPC and spoke with Bassam SAID. The mufti spoke with SAID and encouraged him to be truthful and continue to assist police. Said was spoken to by Detective Kilani and SAID stated that he was still adamant that he did not see Naseam El-Zeyat on the day of Ahmed Fahda's murder. He did, however, acknowledge that he may have mistaken El-Zeyat for Touma. This was due to him believing that Elzeyat had a shaved head and facial hair. Said also indicated that he still has intentions for applying for bail. He further stated that he will sign the last unsigned statement once he can be given a guarantee that he will be granted bail."" 

321Detective Kilani made an affidavit dated 21 July 2010 which is in the following terms: 

""1. I am a Detective Senior Constable of Police. I was involved in Strike Force Adder operating with Task Force Gain from 2004 to 2006. Strike Force Adder was established to investigate into the murder of Ahmed Fahda. 

2. Following a request by Mr Eddie Nedim, Solicitor for the Appellant El-Zeyat, who made an inquiry about a date, I produced to the Office of the Director of Public prosecutions (ODPP) an Investigator's Note made by me. This note is annexed hereto and marked ""A"". 

3. This note was made following a meeting between Sheikh Taj Eldeen Alhilali and Bassam Said on 8 July 2004, at which I was present. 

4. Neither the note nor the fact of the meeting had previously been disclosed to the ODPP or the Appellants' legal advisers. 

5. At the time of the meeting Bassam Said was in custody having been charged on 1 June 2004 with being an accessory after the fact to the murder of Ahmed Fahda. The investigations into that murder were continuing and included speaking to Bassam Said who had provided a statement on 5 November 2003 and an induced statement on 3 June 2004. Apart from operational and public interest immunity considerations for non-disclosure of such a meeting, Said's assistance was ongoing and was not complete. 

6. My Investigator's Note refers to 'the last unsigned statement'. I have not located any such statement but believe this may relate to the information the basis of the induced statement dated 12 July 2004, which was not signed until 3 August 2004, and which I understand was later served as part of the brief of evidence together with the further induced statement of 16 December 2004."" 

322In paragraph 2 of his affidavit Detective Kilani did not say on what date he produced the investigator's note. However, I would infer that the note was produced to the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, for the first time, only shortly before Detective Kilani made his affidavit. 

323A solicitor in the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions made an affidavit on 21 July 2010. The solicitor had searched in the Director of Public Prosecutions files for the trials of the appellants and Darwiche. The solicitor had not located in those files any copy of the investigator's note or any copy of an unsigned statement by Bassam Said. However, in a file relating to Bassam Said the solicitor had found a document made on or about 15 July 2004 referring to an unsigned statement by Bassam Said, which had been received from police on 14 July 2004. In the document there were what purported to be extracts from the unsigned statement. These extracts suggest that the unsigned statement was, or was similar to, the signed statement by Bassam Said (""the third statement""), which, although dated 12 July 2004, was not signed until 3 August 2004. In that signed statement Bassam Said said that he recognised the second shooter as being El-Zeyat. 

324The solicitor found in the same file three pages of photocopied handwritten notes. The solicitor stated in her affidavit ""Neither the author nor the origin of these notes is known"". It would seem quite possible, from the contents of the notes, that the author of the notes was Bassam Said himself but this is not certain. 

325Affidavits were made by the appellants stating that they had had no knowledge of Bassam Said's conversation with Sheikh Alhilali until very recently. 

SUBMISSIONS FOR THE APPELLANTS 

326Some of the principal submissions made on behalf of the appellants in support of the grounds of appeal can be briefly summarised as follows. 

327The investigator's note should have been disclosed to the appellants before the trial, in performance of the Crown's obligation of disclosure. If the investigator's note had been disclosed, inquiries would have been made of Sheikh Alhilali and the evidence the Sheikh has now given about his conversation with Bassam Said would have been obtained. That material could then have been used in cross-examination of Bassam Said, with a devastating effect on Bassam Said's credibility. 

328In the conversation with Sheikh Alhilali Bassam Said swore to the Sheikh that he did not recognise either of the killers. This conversation occurred on 8 July, in between the making by Bassam Said of his second statement and the making of his third statement. In his second statement made on 3 June 2004 he had asserted that Aouad was one of the shooters but that he could not identify the other shooter. In his third statement dated 12 July 2004 and signed 3 August 2004, he asserted that Aouad and El-Zeyat were the shooters. What Bassam Said said to Sheikh Alhilali on 8 July 2004 was consistent with his first statement made on 5 November 2003, in which he had said that he did not recognise either of the shooters. 

329What Bassam Said said on 8 July 2004 was said by him to a senior religious figure, who, it could be inferred, Bassam Said respected and was said after that religious figure had solemnly enjoined him to tell the truth. 

330The investigator's note confirmed that Sheikh Alhilali had had a meeting with Bassam Said on 8 July 2004, that he had encouraged Bassam Said to tell the truth and that Bassam Said had been adamant on 8 July 2004 that he did not see El-Zeyat on the day of the murder. 

331Counsel referred to an apparent inconsistency in the investigator's note. The investigator's note recorded Bassam Said as being adamant that he did not see El-Zeyat on the day of the murder. However, the investigator's note also recorded a willingness on the part of Bassam Said, even if only a conditional willingness, to sign ""the last unsigned statement""; yet, if the unsigned statement was similar to the statement dated 12 July, Bassam Said was saying in the unsigned statement that he recognised El-Zeyat as being one of the killers. 

332It was submitted that the final sentence in the investigator's note emphasised that Bassam Said's willingness to assist in the investigation was conditional upon him receiving benefits. 

333It was submitted that evidence of the investigator's note and the conversation showed that some of the evidence given by Bassam Said at the trial was false, including an assertion by him that he was not asked by police, between the making of his second statement and the making of his third statement, to say who the second shooter was. 

334It was submitted that Bassam Said was a crucial witness in the Crown case. There could be no dispute that he had been at the service station at the time of the shooting. He was not an indemnified witness and, although he had at one stage been charged with being an accessory after the fact, there was no suggestion at the trial that he had been criminally concerned in the murder. 

CROWN SUBMISSIONS 

335The principal submissions made by the Crown on these grounds can be briefly summarised as follows. 

336It was submitted that evidence of the conversation on 8 July 2004 between Bassam Said and Sheikh Alhilali should not be considered as having led to any miscarriage of justice, when regard was had to the evidence which had been given at the trial adversely affecting Bassam Said's credibility, including that he had told lies, that he had made a number of inconsistent statements, that he had deliberately withheld information from the police, that he had only gradually revealed what he knew and that he had been willing to provide information, only if he received some benefit from the authorities in return. 

337The absence of evidence of the conversation of 8 July at the trial had not prevented defence counsel at the trial submitting to the jury that Bassam Said's evidence identifying the two appellants as being the killers was not true and was the result of pressure which had been applied to him, including pressure by law enforcement authorities. 

338In her summing up the trial judge had given the jury strong warnings about the need to exercise care in accepting evidence from Bassam Said. 

339The only use which could have been made at the trial, of evidence about the conversation of 8 July 2004, would have been to further discredit a witness whose potential unreliability was, on the evidence which was before the jury, perfectly obvious and frankly acknowledged by the Crown. 

340If Bassam Said had been confronted at the trial with his conversation with Sheikh Alhilali, it is likely that he would have described what he said to the Sheikh as ""bullshit"", just as he had described his similar assertions in his first statement of 5 November 2003. 

341There was evidence at the trial that Bassam Said was not averse to disregarding a religious obligation to tell the truth. He had made an oath on the Koran to tell the truth before giving evidence before the Crime Commission but had then told what he later admitted to be lies in his evidence before the Crime Commission. 

342What Bassam Said was recorded as saying in part of the investigator's note, that he did not see El-Zeyat on the day of the murder, was clearly false, because there was uncontroverted evidence that he had seen El-Zeyat in the morning and also in the evening of 30 October 2003, including surveillance photographs showing him at Menai in the same group as El-Zeyat. 

343What Bassam Said was recorded as saying in a part of the investigator's note that ""He did, however, acknowledge that he may have mistaken El-Zeyat for Touma"" should be interpreted as indicating that Bassam Said had, prior to 8 July 2004, identified El-Zeyat as one of the shooters. 

344It was submitted that the Crown case against the appellants was strong and that the part of the defence case, that it was the Hannouf brothers who were the killers, was weak. 

DECISION - AOUAD GROUND 6(A), EL-ZEYAT GROUND 5 

345In considering Aouad's fifth ground of appeal and El-Zeyat's second ground of appeal I referred to the principles to be applied by a Court of Criminal Appeal in considering a ground of appeal against conviction based on fresh evidence. 

346It was not disputed that the evidence of the conversation of 8 July 2004 was fresh evidence, that is evidence which was not known to the appellants at the time of the trial and could not by the exercise of reasonable diligence have become known to them at the time of the trial. Sheikh Alhilali said in his affidavit that ""until now"" he had never been asked about the conversation and had never told anyone about the conversation. 

347Nor was there any dispute about the credibility of the evidence, that is as evidence of what was said in the conversation (as distinct from evidence of the truth of the assertions made by Bassam Said in the conversation). As already noted, there was no application by the Crown to cross-examine Sheikh Alhilali on his affidavit and parts of Sheikh Alhilali's affidavit are confirmed by the investigator's note. 

348The issue for this Court is whether the evidence of the conversation, in the context of the evidence given at the trial, would have been likely to have caused the jury to have entertained a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the appellants or whether there is a significant possibility that the jury acting reasonably would have acquitted the appellants. 

349As was submitted by the Crown on this appeal, there was much evidence at the trial adversely affecting the credibility of Bassam Said. There was evidence at the trial that Bassam Said was generally a person of bad character and that in the police investigation he had told lies, had made inconsistent statements, had deliberately concealed information and had provided information only conditionally upon receiving some benefit and that warrants for his arrest had had to be issued to compel him to give evidence at the trial. 

350There was also, as submitted by the Crown on this appeal, much evidence in the Crown case at the trial, apart from the evidence given by Bassam Said, which would not be affected by the fresh evidence. 

351I have nevertheless concluded that, if evidence about the conversation on 8 July 2004 had been before the jury, the jury would have been likely to have entertained a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the appellants or, alternatively, there is a significant possibility that the jury might have acquitted the appellants. 

352Bassam Said is a Moslem and Sheikh Alhilali was the most senior Islamic jurist in Australia. Bassam Said and Sheikh Alhilali knew each other. Sheikh Alhilali went with an investigating police officer to the gaol where Bassam Said was being held. At the gaol he stressed to Bassam Said the importance of his religious duty to tell the truth and to clear his conscience. Bassam Said addressed the Sheikh respectfully and swore by Allah that he did not recognise the killers. Although the conversation focussed on El-Zeyat, Bassam Said asserted in the conversation that he did not recognise either of the killers. 

353In the conversation Bassam Said spoke of the pressures which had been put on him to say that he recognised the killers. 

354In my opinion, if the fresh evidence had been available at the trial and had been used in the cross-examination of Bassam Said, a further serious blow would have been dealt to Bassam Said's credibility. 

355Earlier in this judgment I summarised the evidence in the Crown case. As was submitted by the Crown on this appeal, there was much evidence in the Crown case other than Bassam Said's evidence. 

356However, the only witnesses who actually identified the shooters were Bassam Said and the Hannouf brothers, Wahib Hannouf and Haissam Hannouf. 

357An advantage to the Crown in Bassam Said's evidence was that Bassam Said was indisputably at the service station at the time of the shooting, within a few metres of the victim and the shooters, and would have had a good opportunity of observing the shooters. 

358On the other hand, the evidence of the Hannouf brothers was open to the criticism that it could seem a remarkable coincidence that they happened to be travelling past the service station at the very time the shooting occurred. In accordance with the trial judge's directions in her summing up that the jury could look for independent support for the evidence of one witness in the evidence of another witness, the jury could have looked at Bassam Said's evidence for independent support for the evidence of the Hannouf brothers. 

359Bassam Said also had the advantages as a witness for the Crown that he was not an indemnified witness and there was no suggestion at the trial that he had been criminally concerned in the murder. 

360In my opinion, ground 6(a) of Aouad's appeal and ground 5 of El-Zeyat's appeal should be upheld. 

DECISION - AOUAD GROUND 6(B), EL-ZEYAT GROUND 6 

361It is clear that the investigator's note should have been disclosed to the appellants' legal representatives before the appellants' trial and counsel for the Crown on this appeal did not really make any submission to the contrary. As to the Crown's duty of disclosure see R v Reardon (2004) 60 NSWLR 454 at 468-469 (46-55) and Cornwell v R (2010) NSWCCA 59 at (210). The reasons given in paragraph 5 of Detective Kilani's affidavit, while they might have been legitimate reasons for temporarily not disclosing the note, were not legitimate reasons for not disclosing the note at some time before the trial was held. 

362In Grey v The Queen (2000) 201 CLR 414 the prosecution had failed to disclose to the appellant's legal advisers a document capable of affecting the credibility of an important witness for the Crown at the trial. 

363In their joint judgment, Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Callinan JJ held at paras 8 and 9 that the Court of Criminal Appeal had erred in dealing with this issue by reference to the principles applying to fresh evidence on an appeal, rather than as a case of lack of disclosure by the Crown, and failing to determine whether the failure of the Crown to disclose information in its possession had caused the trial to miscarry. Their Honours said that in a case where there had been a lack of disclosure by the Crown, the only question is whether the appeal should be dismissed because no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred (that is, whether the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act should be applied in favour of the Crown). In determining whether no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred what Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ said in their joint judgment in Wilde v The Queen (1988) 164 CLR 365 at 371-2 should be applied, namely: 

""Those authorities establish that where there has been a departure from the requirements of a properly conducted trial, it cannot be said that there has been no substantial miscarriage of justice if the applicant has thereby lost 'a chance which was fairly open to him of being acquitted' to use the phrase of Fullagar J in Mraz v The Queen (1955) 93 CLR 493 at 514 or 'a real chance of acquittal' to use the phrase of Barwick CJ in Reg v Storey (1978) 140 CLR 364 at 376. Unless it can be said that, had there been no blemish in the trial, an appropriately instructed jury, acting reasonably on the evidence properly before them and applying the correct onus and standard of proof, would inevitably have convicted the accused, the conviction must be set aside: see Driscoll v The Queen (1977) 137 CLR 517 at 524; Reg v Storey; Gallagher v The Queen (1986) 160 CLR 392 at 412-413. Unless that can be said, the accused may have lost a fair chance of acquittal by the failure to afford him the trial to which he was entitled, that is to say, a trial in which the relevant law was correctly explained to the jury and the rules of procedure and evidence were strictly followed: see Mraz V The Queen . The loss of such a chance of acquittal cannot be anything but a substantial miscarriage of justice. The question whether the jury would inevitably have convicted falls to be determined by the Court of Criminal Appeal. It is a question which the Court of Criminal Appeal must answer according to its assessment of the facts of the case."" 

364Since Grey was decided there have, of course, been other High Court decisions on the proviso and in particular Weiss v The Queen (2005) 224 CLR 300. It was not suggested on this appeal that what was said by the High Court in Grey and Wilde was affected by what the High Court said in the later case of Weiss . The present case would seem to me to fall within the class of case identified by the High Court in Weiss at 317(45), where it would be proper for an appellate court to allow an appeal and order a new trial, even if the appellate court were satisfied to the requisite degree of the appellant's guilt, for the reason that there was at the trial a significant denial of procedural fairness. 

365It is true that there are factual differences between the present case and Grey . In Grey the witness in question whose credibility was affected by the document which had not been disclosed, had been presented by the Crown at the trial as a reliable witness, whereas in the present case there was much evidence, and the Crown had frankly acknowledged at the trial, that Bassam Said's credibility could be attacked on a number of grounds. 

366In the present case, if the investigator's note had been disclosed, it is likely that enquiries would have been made of Sheikh Alhilali by the appellants' legal representatives and the appellants' legal representatives would have obtained the information in Sheikh Alhilali's affidavit. That information could then have been used in the cross-examination of Bassam Said. If Bassam Said had denied or had not admitted the conversation, evidence of the conversation could have been given, if necessary after leave had been obtained ( Evidence Act s 106). 

367Although Bassam Said's credibility was challenged on a number of grounds at the trial, the further evidence, if it had been available at the trial, would have dealt a serious blow to his credibility. Bassam Said's evidence was important for the reasons given by counsel for the appellants. In my opinion, it cannot be said, if the test in Wilde and Grey is applied, that the appellants did not lose a chance of acquittal as a result of the investigator's note not having been disclosed. Alternatively I consider that the failure to disclose the note involved a significant denial of procedural fairness. 

368In my opinion Aouad's ground of appeal 6(b) and El-Zeyat's ground of appeal 6 should be upheld. In upholding these grounds of appeal I have already considered the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act . 

APPLICATION BY EL-ZEYAT TO RELY ON ADDITIONAL GROUNDS OF APPEAL 

369As noted earlier in this judgment, the principal hearing of these appeals took place on 29 and 30 June 2010. At the conclusion of the hearing the Court reserved its decision on the appeals. 

370As also noted earlier in this judgment, in July 2010 an application was made by each appellant for leave to rely on an additional ground or grounds of appeal. Leave was granted to Aouad to raise an additional ground of appeal which became ground 6 and 6(b) and to El-Zeyat to raise additional grounds of appeal which became grounds 5 and 6. The Court received submissions on these grounds from the appellants and the Crown. The Court then again reserved its decision on the appeals. 

371Immediately following the principal hearing of the present appeals the Court, constituted by the same judges, heard appeals by Aouad, El-Zeyat, Adnan Darwiche and Abbas Osman against their convictions on various charges. It will be convenient to refer to these appeals as ""the related appeals"". At the conclusion of the hearing of the related appeals in July 2010 the Court reserved its decision on those appeals. 

372In November 2010, while the Court was still reserved on both the present appeals and the related appeals, an application was made by Adnan Darwiche in his related appeal for leave to rely on additional grounds of appeal. This application and a subsequent further application by Darwiche for leave to rely on another additional ground of appeal are dealt with in Johnson J's judgment in the related appeals. 

373After Darwiche had made his first application in his related appeal, the solicitors for each of Aouad and El-Zeyat sent letters to the Registrar of the Court of Criminal Appeal requesting that the Court not deliver its judgments in either the present appeals or the related appeals, until Aouad and El-Zeyat and their legal advisers had had an opportunity to consider whether they also should apply for leave to rely on additional grounds of appeal. The Court acceded to these requests. At the time the requests were made a full draft of the present judgment dealing with the existing grounds of appeal had been prepared. 

374In February 2011 an application was made by El-Zeyat for leave to rely on two additional grounds of appeal in both his present appeal and his related appeal. No application has been made by Aouad to rely on any further ground of appeal in either of his appeals. 

375The additional grounds of appeal which El-Zeyat sought leave to rely on were:- 

Ground 7 

A miscarriage of justice resulted from the absence at trial of fresh evidence, namely the affidavit of Joe Osman affirmed on 12 October 2010. 

Ground 8 

A miscarriage of justice resulted from the absence of trial of fresh evidence, namely the affidavit of Houssam El-Jamal affirmed on 31 January 2011. 

376Insofar as El- Zeyat's application was for leave to rely on the additional grounds of appeal in his related appeal, his application is dealt with by Johnson J in his judgment in the related appeals. In my present judgment I will confine my consideration of El-Zeyat's application to the question of whether leave should be granted to him to rely on the additional grounds of appeal in his present appeal. 

377Both of the proposed additional grounds of appeal are based on alleged fresh evidence. The principles to be applied by this Court in considering a ground of appeal based on alleged fresh evidence, as stated by Kirby J in R v Abou-Chabake, have been set out earlier in this judgment and I will not now repeat them. 

ADDITIONAL GROUND 7 

378In his affidavit of 12 October 2010 Joe Osman, also known as Fadi El-Jamal, stated that in November 2003 he was kidnapped by Wahib and Haissam Hannouf but managed to escape. For his own protection he was kept in a room in a hotel with police for a number of days. While in the room at the hotel he was asked by police officers what he knew about Darwiche. 

379According to Osman's affidavit, he was presented by detectives with a statement using the name ""Samear Havda"" and, after initially refusing to sign the statement, he ultimately did sign the statement due to his feelings of vulnerability and ""intense intimidation"" by the police. 

380Osman said in his affidavit that at a later court hearing in 2006 he was called as a witness and shown the statement. He told the court that the statement was not ""my words and that I did not know what the statement contained"". 

381No copy of the statement made in the name of Samear Havda was annexed to Osman's affidavit. 

382Part of a transcript of a hearing on 14 March 2006 in which Osman gave evidence and was asked about the statement was annexed to an affidavit by El-Zeyat's solicitor. 

383A number of affidavits were filed on behalf of the Crown in which allegations made by Osman in his affidavit were denied. Copies of a statement dated 18 November 2003 and a statement dated 24 May 2004, each made in the name of Samear Havda and signed by Osman, were annexed to an affidavit by a police officer. 

384I do not consider that it is necessary in this judgment to refer in detail to all of the evidence which was filed. I am satisfied that it is quite clear that, for a number of reasons, leave should be refused to rely on this ground. 

385Even extending to the appellant El-Zeyat the latitude required in determining whether alleged fresh evidence was available or could by reasonable diligence have been available to him at his trial, the alleged fresh evidence was so available. The two statements by Osman were referred to in the brief of evidence served on El-Zeyat before the trial. The court hearing on 14 March 2006 was a voir dire enquiry conducted before the trial, at which El Zeyat was represented and in which Osman was called as a witness and asked questions about the two statements and police officers were then called who in turn gave evidence about the statements. 

386Osman's evidence is not ""credible or at least capable of belief"". Among other things, it is clear that he signed, not just a single statement, but two statements, the second of which was made almost six months after the first statement. In the second statement Osman referred to the earlier statement and said that he wanted to make ""some minor amendments"" to it. The amendments made by the second statement can truly be described as ""only minor"". 

387Other matters adversely affecting the credibility of Osman's affidavit are developed by Johnson J in his judgment in the related appeals. 

388Even if the evidence was fresh and capable of belief, it would not, in the context of the evidence given at the trial, have been likely to have caused the jury to have entertained a reasonable doubt about the guilt of El-Zeyat or to give rise to a significant possibility that a jury acting reasonably would have acquitted him. 

389The statement of 18 November 2003 is almost entirely about Adnan Darwiche. There appear to be only four paragraphs in the statement referring to the killing of Ahmed Fahda. The assertions made in these paragraphs are first-hand, second-hand or even third-hand hearsay or mere speculation and, in any event, are concerned with the role that Adnan Darwiche might have played in the killing and not with any role played by El-Zeyat in the killing. 

390I would regard as mere speculation a submission by counsel for El-Zeyat that Osman's evidence was evidence of improper conduct on the part of certain police officers in obtaining a statement from him, from which it might be inferred that the same police officers had engaged in similar improper conduct in obtaining statements from other Crown witnesses. 

391I note that Osman did not give evidence in the trial from which the present appeals have been brought. 

ADDITIONAL GROUND 8 

392Houssam El-Jamal is a brother of Joe Osman. 

393In the affidavit of 31 January 2010 Houssam El-Jamal said that he also had been kidnapped in November 2003 by Wahib Hannouf and Haissam Hannouf. He had been held for three days and had then been released, after his family had paid a ransom. 

394In his affidavit Houssam El-Jamal said that in 2004 he had been charged with an offence and had been refused bail. While in custody, bail refused, he was held in B wing within the SPC section of the Long Bay Correctional Centre. Subsequently Bassam Said was moved to this wing. 

395Paragraphs 14 and 16 and 17 of the affidavit were in the following terms: 

""14. Immediately, I developed a friendship with Bassam Said, and he confided in me the reason why he was moved to 'B' wing. Bassam informed me that the reason why he was moved from 'C' Wing was due to consistent communication over the walls in 'C' Wing to the Hannouf brothers. 

... 

16. A few days after Bassam's arrival he stated to me words to the effect; 

'A police officer by the name of Tamer Kilani told me to make a statement, stating that the shooters of Ahmed Fahda were Ramzy Awad and Naseam El-Zeyat, even though I did not see who the shooters were.' 

17. Further he informed me that police had forced him to make statements. He stated to me words to the effect of; 

'The police said to me, if you do not make a statement stating that they were the shooters, you won't be getting out of jail, you will be getting life.' "" 

396In subsequent parts of his affidavit Houssam El-Jamal said that on a number of occasions, when he and Bassam Said were in the recreation yard of the wing, he witnessed Bassam Said communicating with the Hannouf brothers, including Wahib Hannouf and Haissam Hannouf, who were in the recreation yard of C wing, the two recreation yards being adjacent to each other. Houssam El-Jamal said in his affidavit that he had heard Bassam Said and the Hannouf brothers communicating with each other about the statements they had made to police about the murder of Ahmed Fahda and some of the offences in the related appeals and about ""getting their stories straight"". To the extent to which the affidavit gives any particulars of the communications between Bassam Said and the Hannouf brothers, the particulars are about the offences in the related appeals and not the murder of Ahmed Fahda. 

397The Court received quite extensive evidence and written submissions about the proposed additional ground 8. There are serious issues about the alleged fresh evidence at least as to whether it should be regarded as fresh or capable of belief. However, in my opinion, it is not necessary for the Court to attempt to resolve these issues in order to determine whether leave to rely on the additional ground of appeal should be granted. 

398Insofar as the alleged fresh evidence is that Bassam Said said to Houssam El-Jamal that he did not see who the shooters of Ahmed Fahda were but was subjected to pressure to say that he did recognise the shooters, the alleged evidence is similar in effect to the evidence of Sheikh Alhilali about what the Sheikh said he was told by Bassam Said on 8 July 2004. As I noted earlier in the judgment, there was no dispute that the Sheikh's evidence was fresh and credible. Substantially on the basis of the evidence from the Sheikh, confirmed in part by Detective Kilani's investigation note, I have already held that ground of appeal 5 should be upheld. 

399Insofar as the alleged fresh evidence is evidence of communications between Bassam Said and the Hannouf brothers about the statements they would give to police, the evidence, if it were to be accepted as fresh and capable of belief, might have some significance. 

400However, even if all parts of Houssam El-Jamal's affidavit were to be regarded as satisfying all the conditions for evidence being regarded as fresh evidence, the fresh evidence would not be such as to entitle El-Zeyat to an outright acquittal but only to a quashing of the verdict of guilty, with an order being made for a new trial. Those are the orders I consider should be made in consequence of my upholding the existing grounds of appeal 5 and 6. In these circumstances, I would refuse leave to rely on the additional ground of appeal. 

CONCLUSION 

401Having allowed grounds of appeal against conviction of each appellant, I would allow each appellant's appeal against conviction, quash the conviction of each appellant and order a new trial of each appellant. 

402JOHNSON J: I agree with James J.

     Headnote 
    On 23 July 2009, the Commissioner of Police revoked licences held by the applicants under the Security Industry Act 1997 (NSW). The applicants lodged an application within the Administrative Decisions Tribunal (""the Tribunal"") for review of the revocation decision, as well as for a stay of the decision under s 60(2) of the Administrative Decisions Tribunal Act 1997 (NSW) (""the ADT Act""), pending the determination of the review. On 30 July, Deputy President Hennessy heard the stay application, declined to grant it, and set down the hearing of the review application for 17 August. During the hearing of the application, her Honour admitted and took into consideration a confidential exhibit, involving ""criminal intelligence reports or other criminal information"", which was not provided to the applicants. This course of action was taken in accordance with the obligations imposed upon the Tribunal by s 29(3) of the Security Industry Act, which applied in circumstances where the Tribunal was ""determining an application for review of any decision … to revoke a licence."" On 4 August, the applicants lodged an application to appeal to the Appeal Panel against the refusal of the stay, on the basis that her Honour had erred in holding that s 29(3) applied to the hearing of the stay application. The appeal was allowed on 11 August, and the matter remitted to Deputy President Hennessy, who on 13 August granted the stay.On 12 August, the Commissioner filed a summons in the Common Law Division seeking leave to appeal against the Appeal Panel's decision. On 16 December Rothman J quashed the decision of the Appeal Panel. The applicants now seek leave to appeal from the decision of Rothman J.The issue for determination on appeal was whether the obligation upon the Tribunal imposed by s 29(3) of the Security Industry Act applies to the hearing of an application for a stay of the Commissioner's decision.The Court held, dismissing the appeal:1. An order in the nature of a 'stay' granted pursuant to s 60(2) of the ADT Act is a decision made in the course of review proceedings, which will affect, on a temporary basis, the operation of the reviewable decision. It is thus distinguishable from the common usage of a stay, granted to preserve the status quo or the subject matter of an appeal, pending a final determination of that appeal: [16], [19]–[21], [95].

    2. Neither the specific language of s 29(3), nor its statutory context or purpose, supports a construction that would render the determination of a 'stay' application a discrete and separate function to that of determining an application for review of a reviewable decision: [21]–[25], [122], [126], [129], [146], [166]–[167].

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BASTEN JA: This matter involves proceedings currently before the Administrative Decisions Tribunal in relation to the revocation by the Commissioner of Police of various licences granted to the applicants under the Security Industry Act 1997 (NSW).  
     
      
    2 A question is raised as to the operation of s 29(3) of the Security Industry Act in relation to an application made by the applicants for a stay of the revocation decision, pending determination of their appeals to the Tribunal. Section 29, relevantly for present purposes, reads as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        29 Right to seek review from Administrative Decisions Tribunal 
         
          
          (1) A person may apply to the Administrative Decisions Tribunal for a review of the following decisions:  
           
            
            (a) the refusal or failure by the Commissioner to grant a licence to the person (other than by operation of section 24 (3)), 
             
            (b) a condition imposed by the Commissioner on a licence granted to the person, 
             
            (c) the revocation or suspension of a licence granted to the person. 
            
           
          … 
          
         
         
          
          (3) In determining an application for a review of any decision to refuse to grant a licence or to revoke a licence that was made on the ground of the applicant not being a fit and proper person, the Administrative Decisions Tribunal:  
           
            
            (a) is to ensure that it does not, in the reasons for its decision or otherwise, disclose the existence or content of any criminal intelligence report or other criminal information referred to in section 15 (6) without the approval of the Commissioner, and 
             
            (b) in order to prevent the disclosure of any such report or other criminal information, is to receive evidence and hear argument in the absence of the public, the applicant for review, the applicant’s representative and any other interested party, unless the Commissioner approves otherwise. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    3 Whatever the effect of sub-s (3), the applicants do not dispute that it will operate with respect to the determination of their appeals by the Tribunal. Their short point is that, in considering whether to grant a stay of the revocation decisions, the Tribunal was not “determining an application for review of any decision … to revoke a licence” and hence the provision had no operation.  
     
      
    4 In practical terms that meant that the Commissioner, when faced with a stay application, had to decide whether to disclose to the Tribunal the existence and content of any criminal intelligence report or other criminal information upon which the Commissioner might seek to rely for the purposes of the review. Whether the Tribunal would require the material to be disclosed to the applicants would then depend, not on the consent of the Commissioner, but general law principles, including those relating to public interest immunity. 
     
      
    Procedural history5 The matter first came before Deputy President Hennessy in the Tribunal on 30 July 2009. Her Honour received material from the Commissioner, which, pursuant to s 29(3), was not disclosed to the applicants. She refused to grant a stay, but ordered that the hearing of the review be expedited. With commendable alacrity, it was set down for hearing on 17 and 18 August 2009. 
     
      
    6 The applicants sought leave to appeal from her Honour’s decision to an Appeal Panel of the Tribunal. The basis of the appeal was that her Honour had admitted and taken into consideration a confidential exhibit, involving “criminal intelligence reports or other criminal information”, which was not provided to the applicants, as explained by the Appeal Panel in its reasons for decision of 11 August 2009: AVS Group of Companies Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Police (NSW) (GD) [2009] NSWADTAP 48 at [7]. The Appeal Panel held that she was in error in taking that course, concluding that s 29(3) did not apply to interlocutory proceedings such as an application for a stay: at [27]. The Appeal Panel did not itself determine whether a stay should be ordered. Rather, it remitted the matter to Deputy President Hennessy for her Honour to deal with the matter “according to law”. Her Honour’s decision was not in terms set aside, but that was the intended effect of the orders made by the Appeal Panel. 
     
      
    7 On 13 August 2009 Deputy President Hennessy reconsidered the application for a stay on the basis that s 29(3) did not apply to that application. The Commissioner declined in those circumstances to submit the material upon which he had relied in the earlier hearing. Her Honour granted a stay. 
     
      
    8 By summons filed in the Common Law Division, the Commissioner sought leave to appeal against the decision of the Appeal Panel. (Neither party sought to put the summons before this Court until the Court expressly requested it.) On that appeal the Commissioner sought to set aside the orders made by the Appeal Panel allowing the appeal and remitting the matter to the Deputy President for further consideration. On 16 December 2009 the primary judge, Rothman J, “quashed” the “decision” of the Appeal Panel and dismissed the applicants’ summons for judicial review of the Commissioner’s decisions to revoke their licences: Commissioner of Police v AVS Group of Companies Pty Ltd [2009] NSWSC 1408. There was no reference in those orders to the stay granted by Deputy President Hennessy upon her Honour’s reconsideration of the application.  
     
      
    9 Rothman J held that the application for a stay was part of the proceedings pending before the Tribunal to review the revocation of the licences and hence s 29(3) operated: at [44]. On that basis, Deputy President Hennessy was correct in her original approach to the stay application and the Appeal Panel was in error. Although the applicants should have leave to appeal, the judgment should be upheld and, subject to some minor variations in the orders made, the appeal from Rothman J should be dismissed. 
     
      
    Issue of statutory construction10 Section 29(3), as set out above, is concerned with two sources of material, namely a “criminal intelligence report” and “other criminal information”. Neither of those terms is defined. They are, however, as the section notes, referred to in s 15(6) of the Security Industry Act. 
     
      
    11 Section 15 sets out grounds on which the Commissioner either must or may refuse to grant a licence: s 15(1), (2) and (3). Sections 15(6) and (7) read as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        15 Restrictions on granting licence—general suitability criteria 
         
          
          … 
           
          (6) For the purpose of determining whether an applicant is a fit and proper person to hold the class of licence sought by the applicant, the Commissioner may have regard to any criminal intelligence report or other criminal information held in relation to the applicant that:  
           
            
            (a) is relevant to the activities carried out under the class of licence sought by the applicant, or 
             
            (b) causes the Commissioner to conclude that improper conduct is likely to occur if the applicant were granted the licence, or 
             
            (c) causes the Commissioner not to have confidence that improper conduct will not occur if the applicant were granted the licence. 
            
           
          (7) The Commissioner is not, under this or any other Act or law, required to give any reasons for not granting a licence if the giving of those reasons would disclose the existence or content of any criminal intelligence report or other criminal information as referred to in subsection (6). 
          
         
        
       
      
    12 There are other matters which may require the Commissioner to refuse a licence, for example, being of the opinion that the applicant “has been involved in corrupt conduct”: s 16(3). 
     
      
    13 The prohibition on requiring disclosure of either “the existence or content” of any such report or information, pursuant to s 15(7), is in its terms limited to the reasons for not granting a licence. Its application with respect to revocation arises from the operation of s 26 which relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        26 Revocation of licence 
         
          
          … 
           
          (1A) The Commissioner must revoke a licence where the Commissioner is satisfied that, if the licensee were applying for a new licence, the application would be required by this Act to be refused. 
           
          (2) The Commissioner may revoke a licence by serving on the licensee, personally or by post, a notice stating that the licence is revoked and the reasons for revoking it. 
           
          (3) The revocation of a licence by such a notice takes effect when the notice is served or on a later date specified in the notice.  
          
         
        
       
      
    14 It has been assumed for the purposes of this matter that the obligation to revoke invokes at least the provision of s 15(1)(a), requiring the Commissioner to refuse to grant a licence if satisfied that the applicant “is not a fit and proper person to hold the class of licence sought”. That engages the provisions of sub-s (6) and (7), so that the Commissioner cannot be compelled to disclose, with respect to the revocation of a licence, material which he could not be required to disclose in respect of a refusal to grant a licence. That approach is consistent with s 29(3), which refers to both a refusal to grant a licence and a decision to revoke a licence. Further, the note to sub-s 29(3) reads as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Note. 
         Section 15(7) of this Act provides that the Commissioner is not, under this or any other Act or law, required to give any reasons for not granting a licence if the giving of those reasons would disclose the existence or content of any criminal intelligence report or other criminal information referred to in section 15 (6). Accordingly, Part 2 of Chapter 5 of the  
        Administrative Decisions Tribunal Act 1997 
         does not apply to any decision to refuse to grant a licence based on such information to the extent that it would require disclosure of the existence or content of any criminal intelligence report or other criminal information. 
        
       
      
    The stay application in the Tribunal15 The decision of the Commissioner revoked the applicants’ statutory licences. The form of the notice, given on 15 July 2009, was that the relevant licences “have been revoked”. It was not expressed to operate at some future time, but required that the licences be surrendered to the police “upon service of this notice”. It took effect on the date of service: Security Industry Act, s 26(3). The notice was either valid or it was not: the judicial review proceedings having been dismissed, it must be taken to have been valid and effective. The notification also advised that the “revocation of a licence means that you are no longer authorised to engage in any security activity in respect of the class of licence revoked”. 
     
      
    16 What the applicants required, in order to continue their licensed operations, was an order reinstating their licences. That cannot be achieved in terms by a “stay”, a somewhat imprecise term which is usually understood to refer to a future event, which has not yet taken place: see McBride v Walton (Unrep, NSWCA, 27 August 1993) (Handley JA). 
     
      
    17 The relevant source of power is found in s 60 of the Administrative Decisions Tribunal Act 1997 (NSW) (“the ADT Act”), which relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        60 Operation and implementation of decisions pending applications for review 
         
          
          (1) Subject to this section, an application to the Tribunal for a review of a reviewable decision does not affect the operation of the decision under review or prevent the taking of action to implement that decision. 
           
          (2) On the application of any party to proceedings for an application for a review of a reviewable decision, the Tribunal may make such orders staying or otherwise affecting the operation of the decision under review as it considers appropriate to secure the effectiveness of the determination of the application.  
          
         
        
       
      
    18 It is arguable that the second limb of s 60, (referring to an order “otherwise affecting the operation of the decision under review”) would allow the Tribunal to suspend the operation of a revocation of a licence, or reinstate the licence on a temporary basis. That approach may gain support from the scope for a final decision on a review to operate from the date of the original decision: ADT Act, s 66(2)(b). Arguably that could be done by retrospectively varying the date from which the Commissioner’s order was to have effect. Although the Tribunal did not make an order otherwise than in terms of a “stay”, the question of statutory construction should be addressed having regard to the scope and effect of the orders available under s 60. Indeed, it was assumed by the applicants that the order in fact made allowed them to continue to operate, as if they held valid licences. 
     
      
    19 There is no doubt that an order in the nature of a “stay” made pursuant to s 60 is an order separate and distinct from the kind of final order which may be made in determining an application for review of a reviewable decision: ADT Act, s 63(3). Nevertheless, it is a decision made in the course of review proceedings, which will affect, on a temporary basis, the operation of the reviewable decision. It is made in circumstances where the statute provides that the making of an application for review does not itself affect the operation of the decision: s 60(1). 
     
      
    20 The applicants sought to contrast the language of s 60(2), which refers to the power of the Tribunal to grant a stay “on the application of any party to proceedings for an application for a review of a reviewable decision”, with the language of s 29(3), which imposes an obligation on the Tribunal “[i]n determining an application for a review of” a relevant reviewable decision. However, the linguistic variation is to be explained by reference to the different purposes of the two provisions, which are not relevantly served by identical language. Thus, the obligations imposed by s 29(3) apply to the process of determining an application for review; the purpose of s 60(2) is to confer on the Tribunal a specific power which, if sought by a party to extant proceedings, may be exercised for the purposes of (and in the course of) the application for review.  
     
      
    21 A stay is commonly granted to preserve the status quo or the subject matter of an appeal (or review), pending a final determination of the appeal. It is granted in the course of the appeal (or review) as a step in the process of determining the subject matter of the appeal (or review). Interlocutory orders of a kind which might not form part of the final determination are regularly made in the course of proceedings, including decisions with respect to the admission or rejection of evidence, the granting of adjournments, and numerous other matters. The material upon which the Commissioner based the decision under review might well be relevant to an interlocutory decision sought under s 60. The purpose of s 29(3) is to maintain the non-disclosure of the existence and content of identified information. To limit the purposes for which the protection was available, so as to exclude some interlocutory steps, would tend to subvert the purpose of the provision.  
     
      
    22 Nor is it relevant that the material sought to be protected can be provided or not by the Commissioner as he or she thinks fit. The effect of the proposed construction would be to limit the manner in which the Commissioner can seek or resist orders in the course of proceedings before the Tribunal, in circumstances where the section gives no support for such a limitation. 
     
      
    23 Furthermore, a ‘stay’ has the immediate effect of subverting the operation of a decision made by the Commissioner. The material on which the Commissioner acted may only be found in a criminal intelligence report which in his or her view should not be disclosed. The information may provide a powerful basis for a decision to revoke a licence and may be of the utmost sensitivity. The Commissioner might legitimately fear to put the material before the Tribunal, absent the protection provided by s 29(3). However, the refusal of a stay might mean that the applicant remained in a position to carry out serious criminal conduct before the application for review could be determined. 
     
      
    24 Of course, the Commissioner could exercise the power in less pressing circumstances, or in circumstances which others might think did not justify withholding the material. While an unreviewable power is open to abuse, the conferral of such a power is a matter for the legislature. Further, there may be respects in which the engagement of the power is reviewable by the Tribunal. No such question arises in the present proceeding. 
     
      
    25 It is sufficient in order to construe the section, to conclude that the basis on which the Commissioner might seek to resist a stay may be the basis upon which the Commissioner will seek to uphold the revocation. Furthering the apparent purpose of s 29(3) requires its application at all stages of the Tribunal’s proceedings in determining the application for review. A purposive approach to the operation of the section is to be preferred to an approach which does not further its apparent purpose: Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW), s 33. 
     
      
    26 To the extent that the applicants were not seeking from the Tribunal a “stay” of the Commissioner’s decision, in the sense of an order designed to prevent an operation which had not yet taken place, but rather the retrospective variation of the decision of the Commissioner to undo consequences which had already occurred, the arbitrariness of the applicants’ distinction is accentuated. They had to contend that, while s 29(3) undoubtedly operates in determining an application to vary, on a final basis, the Commissioner’s decision, it does not apply to a step in the process which seeks a temporary variation of the Commissioner’s decision. There is no practical or linguistic justification for such a result. 
     
      
    Procedural anomalies27 The chronology of this matter demonstrates a state of affairs which should not have been allowed to develop. First, the attempt by the applicants to undertake merit review of the Commissioner’s decision in the Tribunal and, contemporaneously, seek judicial review of the Commissioner’s decision was inappropriate. These procedures were mutually exclusive: if judicial review were successful, there would be no original decision to be reconsidered by the Tribunal. If, on the other hand, the Tribunal had upheld the review of the Commissioner’s decision, that decision would have been set aside and could not have been judicially reviewed. Further, if the proceedings in the Tribunal confirmed the decisions of the Commissioner, the decisions were, nevertheless, those made by the Tribunal and no purpose would have been served by a review of the original decisions of the Commissioner. It is sometimes said that an error on the part of the initial decision-maker may be “cured” by a later appeal on the merits: more correctly in this case, the legally erroneous decision would have been replaced by a new decision which had legal effect in place of the earlier decision. For example, procedural fairness at first instance would not vitiate the later decision-making. 
     
      
    28 The Supreme Court should not have considered the application for judicial review of the Commissioner’s decision whilst an appeal was pending before the Tribunal. However, as Campbell JA notes, the application for judicial review having been determined and dismissed, there are no longer inconsistent challenges on foot. 
     
      
    29 Secondly, various matters addressed in the Tribunal have been the subject of sequential interlocutory appeals to the Supreme Court. These have included a request for reasons from the Commissioner, a request to the Tribunal to appoint a special advocate to see the confidential information and a refusal of leave to appeal, by a Deputy President constituting the Appeal Panel, from a direction that reasons need not reveal the confidential information. 
     
      
    30 The appeals have not all been brought by the applicants: the challenge to the decision of the Appeal Panel on the application of s 29(3) to the stay application was brought by the Commissioner. These appeals and applications have so far come before six separate judges in the Common Law Division. On 14 October 2009, the applicants obtained orders from David Kirby J, including “a stay of the hearing in the Administrative Tribunal on 21 and 23 October 2009” and an order preventing the Tribunal from fixing a date for hearing of the appeal in the Tribunal, pending determination of an “application for declaratory relief”, then listed before Rothman J. The latter order expired when Rothman J delivered judgment on 16 December 2009. The effect and currency of the former order is unclear, but it appears to have been spent by 24 October 2009. 
     
      
    31 It may be inferred that the applicants are anxious not to proceed with a hearing in the Tribunal without exhausting all avenues to obtain the confidential information which the Commissioner does not wish to disclose. That issue should have been identified and dealt with as a single interlocutory matter, without necessarily requiring that proceedings in the Tribunal be stayed while it was determined.  
     
      
    32 The result of the interlocutory orders made so far appears to have been to allow the applicants to continue to operate in circumstances where the Commissioner of Police has determined that the necessary licences should be revoked. Whether that result is one which should have been allowed to occur need not be pursued; nor need the legal effects of the particular orders be determined. However, the potential for unintended consequences to flow from a multiplicity of interlocutory appeals is accentuated where there is a lack of coordination exercised over the appeal procedures. 
     
      
    33 Thirdly, the matters seeking to review decisions of the Appeal Panel were commenced, and allowed to proceed, in the Common Law Division. The Appeal Panel of the Tribunal is a “specified Tribunal” for the purposes of s 48 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW). Both an appeal from such a tribunal and any other process seeking to review the decision of a specified tribunal are assigned to this Court: s 48(2). The amendment which had that effect commenced on 1 January 2009 and applied to all proceedings commenced in the Court after the commencement of the amendment: Administrative Decisions Tribunal Amendment Act 2008 (NSW), Sch 2, Pt 2.7 [1] and [4]. As a result, two judgments have been given and several interlocutory orders made in the Common Law Division, which should not have been made in that Division.  
     
      
    34 An exception is the matter determined by Schmidt J on 26 February 2010, which came to her Honour by summons seeking declaratory relief in relation to the process before the Tribunal: AVS Group of Companies Pty Limited v Commissioner of Police [2010] NSWSC 109. Those proceedings sought to review an interlocutory direction given by the Tribunal. It appears not to have been contended that the proceedings were an abuse of process, in that they effectively evaded the need to obtain leave from the Appeal Panel to review such a decision, together with the need to obtain leave from this Court, if it were sought to appeal the decision of the Appeal Panel. As a result, orders have been made by a judge in the Common Law Division without regard to the statutory scheme. 
     
      
    Consideration of appropriate orders35 Although the Appeal Panel decision of 11 August 2009 resulted in the matter being relisted before Deputy President Hennessy on 13 August 2009, neither party initially put before this Court the order then made. A record prepared by the Registrar of the Tribunal dated 25 March 2010 (presumably for the purposes of the further hearing in this Court on 26 March) identified the first order as “Stay granted”. However, that appears to have been partly inaccurate: the transcript of the hearing on 13 August 2009 (p 33) identified the order made by the Tribunal as “a stay is granted pending further decision of the Tribunal”.  
     
      
    36 On 17 December 2009, Rothman J stayed, until 8 February 2010, order 2 made on the previous day, which order quashed the decision of the Appeal Panel. It should perhaps be assumed that the effect of the order of 17 December was to vary order 2 (which had no doubt then been entered), pursuant to Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW), r 36.16, to delay its operation: r 36.4(3). 
     
      
    37 Until the matter was relisted at the instance of the Court, the parties failed to address the precise effects which flowed from the order of the primary judge setting aside the decision of the Appeal Panel with regard to the refusal of a stay. On one view, his Honour’s decision, setting aside the decision of the Appeal Panel, may have validated the first decision of Deputy President Hennessy refusing a ‘stay’, and invalidated the later decision made on 13 August 2009 to grant a stay when the matter came back to her from the Appeal Panel. Were that not so, there would have been no purpose in staying his Honour’s orders. 
     
      
    38 The result of the judgment below was to affirm that the approach adopted by Deputy President Hennessy on the first hearing of the ‘stay’ application was not attended by legal error. However, such a conclusion did not expressly resurrect her Honour’s refusal to grant a stay, nor did it set aside her Honour’s later decision (albeit approached on an erroneous basis) to grant a stay.  
     
      
    39 The fact that Deputy President Hennessy validly refused a stay on the first occasion did not affect her Honour’s power subsequently to grant a ‘stay’. The effect of the order made on 13 August 2009 was not an issue litigated in this Court; nor could it have been in these proceedings. The Commissioner, who resisted that order, has not asked this Court to intervene; it is no doubt open to him to apply to the Deputy President to vary or revoke the order made on 13 August 2009, pursuant to s 61 of the ADT Act, now that the legally correct basis for determining such an application has been resolved. Rothman J not having set aside the order of 13 August, a stay of his orders was unnecessary. The interlocutory stay ordered by this Court on 8 February 2010 will expire on delivery of this judgment. A stay of this Court’s orders would be unnecessary. 
     
      
    40 For technical reasons it is appropriate to vary orders (i), (ii) and (iii) made by Rothman J. In relation to order (i), it is not in doubt that the decision of the Tribunal from which the appeal was brought was an interlocutory decision; indeed the applicants relied upon that proposition for their construction argument. Therefore leave was required and there should have been no equivocation in order (i). 
     
      
    41 In relation to order (ii), the powers of the Court on an appeal are to affirm or set aside the decision of the Appeal Panel: ADT Act, s 120. The language of “quashing” is inapt. In relation to order (iii) I accept that s 120 of the ADT Act provides for an order “remitting the case… to the Appeal Panel”. However, first, the subject matter in the Supreme Court proceedings (“the case”) is not the appeal to the Appeal Panel and, strictly speaking, the statutory language is inapt. Secondly, there is no reason to send the matter back to the Appeal Panel, nor did Rothman J purport to do so. Accordingly, it is sufficient to set aside the orders in the Appeal Panel.  
     
      
    42 I agree with the orders proposed by Campbell JA. 
     
      
    43 CAMPBELL JA: Each of the two Applicants for leave to appeal once held a licence under the Security Industry Act 1997 (the “SI Act”). On 23 July 2009, a delegate of the Commissioner of Police served a notice that revoked those licences, and a licence that had been issued to what appears to be a related company, ASET Security and Training Pty Ltd (“ASET”). The notice gave two reasons for the revocation. One of them was that the Commissioner was of the opinion that the licensee was no longer a fit and proper person to hold a security licence. The second reason is one that the Commissioner no longer seeks to support. 
     
      
    44 A complicated series of legal proceedings then ensued. On 29 July 2009, the Applicants and ASET lodged in the Administrative Decisions Tribunal (“the Tribunal”) an application under the Administrative Decisions Tribunal Act 1997 (“ADT Act”) for review of the decision to revoke the licences. On the same day the Applicants and ASET lodged in the Tribunal an application for a stay pending the determination of the review. 
     
      
    45 On 30 July 2009, Magistrate Hennessy, Deputy President, heard the stay application and declined to grant a stay. Her Honour set down the hearing of the application for review to commence on 17 August 2009.  
     
      
    46 On 4 August 2009, the Applicants and ASET lodged in the Tribunal an application to appeal to the Appeal Panel against the refusal of the stay. The Appeal Panel of the Tribunal granted that leave on 10 August 2009, and immediately heard the substance of the appeal. In its decision delivered on 11 August 2009 (AVS Group of Companies Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Police (NSW) (GD) [2009] NSWADTAP 48) the Appeal Panel allowed the appeal, and remitted to Deputy President Hennessy the application for a stay, to be determined in accordance with the Appeal Panel’s reasons. 
     
      
    47 In brief, the dispute before the Appeal Panel arose from the fact that, at the hearing of the stay application, counsel for the Commissioner had tendered some evidence that the Deputy President admitted as a confidential exhibit at a closed season, without the contents of that exhibit being disclosed to the Applicants. The Deputy President evidently took the view that she was justified in taking that course by the terms of section 29(3) SI Act. While the terms of that provision will need to be considered in more detail later, its gist is that it obliges the Tribunal to receive certain evidence in secret “in determining an application for a review of any decision … to revoke a licence that was made on the ground of the applicant not being a fit and proper person”. The question that was at issue in the Appeal Panel, and that continues to be at issue in this Court, is whether the obligation under section 29(3) that applies “in determining an application for a review” attaches to the hearing of an application for a stay pending the hearing of a review of a decision. The Appeal Panel held, in substance, that the obligation did not apply to an application for a stay.  
     
      
    48 When the remitted application for a stay was heard again by Deputy President Hennessy on 13 August 2009, counsel for the Commissioner did not tender the material that the Deputy President had previously received on a confidential basis. At the conclusion of the hearing on 13 August 2009, the Tribunal granted the stay application.  
     
      
    49 Meanwhile, on 12 August 2009, the Commissioner had initiated proceedings in the Supreme Court appealing against the decision the Appeal Panel had made on 11 August 2009. The right of appeal to the Supreme Court arose under section 119(1) ADT Act, which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “A party to proceedings before an Appeal Panel of the Tribunal may appeal to the Supreme Court, on a question of law, against any decision of the Appeal Panel in those proceedings.” 
        
       
       
      The relevant question of law was whether section 29(3) applied to an application for a stay. 
       
      
    50 Pursuant to section 119(1A) ADT Act such an appeal lies only by leave of the Supreme Court if the decision of the Appeal Panel that is in question is an interlocutory decision.  
     
      
    51 The Appeal Panel that had made the decision in question did not include a judge. Before the Administrative Decisions Tribunal Amendment Act 2008, Schedule 2.7[1] added “an Appeal Panel or” to the start of section 48(1)(a)(viii) Supreme Court Act 1970, the application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court would have lain, pursuant to sections 48 and 49 Supreme Court Act 1970, to a Division of the Court: Daykin v SAS Trustee Corp [2001] NSWSC 58; (2001) 51 NSWLR 328 at [18]; Puglisi v Administrative Decisions Tribunal of NSW Appeal Panel [2001] NSWCA 298 at [1]. However the commencement of the 2008 amending Act, on 1 January 2009, had the effect that the appeal against the decision of the Appeal Panel should have been to this Court. Thus, it was irregular for the application for leave to appeal to be heard by a single judge such as his Honour Justice Rothman on 25 August 2009. However, section 51 Supreme Court Act has the effect that the proceedings were “well commenced” despite the irregularity. Further, as a judge of a superior court has now made orders relating to the application for leave to appeal, those orders are effective unless and until set aside on appeal.  
     
      
    52 Rothman J heard the application for leave to appeal together with an application brought by the Applicants and ASET against the Commissioner of Police for an order in the nature of prerogative relief, quashing the original decision of the Commissioner to revoke the licences. That application for prerogative relief did not succeed, and no application for leave to appeal is made concerning it. 
     
      
    53 The application to the Tribunal for review, that had once been set down for hearing on 17 August 2009, had not been heard by the time of Rothman J’s decision (indeed, it has still not been heard). A question arose at the hearing of the appeal about the propriety of the Applicants and ASET having sought prerogative relief to quash the Commissioner’s decision at the same time as they had on foot a merits appeal against that same decision: cf The King v Poole; ex parte Henry (1938) 61 CLR 1 at 7; Wishart v Fraser (1941) 64 CLR 470; Blacker v Parnell [1978] 1 NSWLR 616. However, when the application for prerogative relief has now been determined, and dismissed, and no appeal is on foot from it, that question is no longer a live one. 
     
      
    54 Rothman J gave his decision on 16 December 2009: Commissioner of Police v AVS Group of Companies Pty Ltd [2009] NSWSC 1408. Rothman J concluded that the obligation of the Tribunal under section 29(3) was one that applied in the course of hearing an application for a stay. His Honour had some doubt about whether leave to appeal was necessary, but did not resolve that doubt. So far as presently relevant, his Honour granted the Commissioner leave to appeal (if it were necessary) against the decision of the Appeal Panel of 11 August 2009, quashed that decision, and remitted the matter to the Tribunal.  
     
      
    55 The present application is an application for leave to appeal from the decision of Rothman J. ASET is not a party to the application for leave to appeal. Mr Gray SC, counsel for the Applicants, has informed us that the absence of ASET from the proceedings in this Court was not an oversight, but was because the ownership of ASET has recently changed. 
     
      
    56 Rothman J granted a stay until 8 February 2010 of that aspect of his own orders that quashed the decision of the Appeal Panel. On 8 February 2010 Giles JA extended that stay until the disposal of the application for leave to appeal to this Court and any appeal for which leave may be granted. 
     
      
    57 The Applicants have made two other applications to the Supreme Court, concerning other aspects of the proceedings in the Tribunal. Both of them have been decided: AVS Group of Companies Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Police [2009] NSWSC 1391 (Davies J, 18 December 2009) and AVS Group of Companies Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Police [2010] NSWSC 109 (Schmidt J, 26 February 2010). Neither of those applications bear directly upon the present application. 
     
      
    Leave to Appeal 
     
      
    58 Section 29(3) of the SI Act is comparatively new legislation, having been enacted in 2005, and commenced on 1 June 2007 (s 2 and Government Gazette No 72, 1 June 2007, at 3,050). Though some aspects of the operation of section 29(3) have been considered by this Court in Commissioner of Police NSW v Gray [2009] NSWCA 49; (2009) 74 NSWLR 1, that decision did not involve any dispute about its effect on an application for a stay. 
     
      
    59 The Commissioner supports the granting of leave to appeal. Mr Lynch, counsel for the Commissioner, submits that the application “raises an issue of general and continuing importance about the operation of s 29(3) [SI Act], and the scope of the decision in Commissioner of Police v Gray”.  
     
      
    60 In my view, it is appropriate to grant leave to appeal. I will henceforth refer to the Applicants as the Appellants. 
     
      
    Relevant Provisions of Security Industry Act 
     
      
    61 Section 7 SI Act prohibits the carrying on of various activities concerning provision of security without a licence. Sections 9-12A establish various classes of licence, each of which authorises the licensee to carry out security activities of a particular kind. 
     
      
    62 Section 14 provides for a person to apply to the Commissioner for the grant of a licence, and identifies the form in which such application should be made, and the evidence by which it must be accompanied. 
     
      
    63 Section 15 requires the Commissioner to refuse to grant an application for a licence in certain circumstances. One of those circumstances, identified in section 15(1)(a), is that the Commissioner is satisfied that the applicant is not a fit and proper person to hold the class of licence sought by the applicant. Section 15 also provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(6) For the purpose of determining whether an applicant is a fit and proper person to hold the class of licence sought by the applicant, the Commissioner may have regard to any criminal intelligence report or other criminal information held in relation to the applicant that:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) is relevant to the activities carried out under the class of licence sought by the applicant, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) causes the Commissioner to conclude that improper conduct is likely to occur if the applicant were granted the licence, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) causes the Commissioner not to have confidence that improper conduct will not occur if the applicant were granted the licence. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (7) The Commissioner is not, under this or any other Act or law, required to give any reasons for not granting a licence if the giving of those reasons would disclose the existence or content of any criminal intelligence report or other criminal information as referred to in subsection (6).” 
        
       
      
    64 Section 21(1) provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Commissioner may, after considering an application:  
        
       
       
        
        (a) grant a licence to the person making the application …, or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) refuse to grant a licence.” 
        
       
      
    65 The term of a licence is governed by section 24: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A licence remains in force for a period of 5 years (or such shorter period as may be prescribed by the regulations) from the day on which it comes into force, unless sooner surrendered or revoked or it otherwise ceases to be in force. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) A licence cannot be renewed, but an application for a new licence may be made in accordance with this Act.” 
        
       
      
    66 Section 26 identifies various circumstances in which a licence may be revoked. Section 26(1A) provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Commissioner must revoke a licence where the Commissioner is satisfied that, if the licensee were applying for a new licence, the application would be required by this Act to be refused.” 
        
       
      
    67 The combined effect of section 26(1A) and section 15(1)(a) is that the Commissioner must revoke a licence where the Commissioner is satisfied that the person holding it is not a fit and proper person to hold that particular class of licence.  
     
      
    68 Section 26 continues: 
     
      
       
        
        “(2) The Commissioner may revoke a licence by serving on the licensee, personally or by post, a notice stating that the licence is revoked and the reasons for revoking it. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) The revocation of a licence by such a notice takes effect when the notice is served or on a later date specified in the notice. 
        
       
      
    69 Section 29 contains the following provisions: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A person may apply to the Administrative Decisions Tribunal for a review of the following decisions:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the refusal or failure by the Commissioner to grant a licence to the person (other than by operation of section 24 (3)), 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) a condition imposed by the Commissioner on a licence granted to the person, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the revocation or suspension of a licence granted to the person. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (3) In determining an application for a review of any decision to refuse to grant a licence or to revoke a licence that was made on the ground of the applicant not being a fit and proper person, the Administrative Decisions Tribunal:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) is to ensure that it does not, in the reasons for its decision or otherwise, disclose the existence or content of any criminal intelligence report or other criminal information referred to in section 15 (6) without the approval of the Commissioner, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) in order to prevent the disclosure of any such report or other criminal information, is to receive evidence and hear argument in the absence of the public, the applicant for review, the applicant’s representative and any other interested party, unless the Commissioner approves otherwise. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Note. 
           Section 15(7) of this Act provides that the Commissioner is not, under this or any other Act or law, required to give any reasons for not granting a licence if the giving of those reasons would disclose the existence or content of any criminal intelligence report or other criminal information referred to in section 15 (6). Accordingly, Part 2 of Chapter 5 of the  
          Administrative Decisions Tribunal Act  
          1997 
           does not apply to any decision to refuse to grant a licence based on such information to the extent that it would require disclosure of the existence or content of any criminal intelligence report or other criminal information.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    70 In Commissioner of Police v Gray, McColl JA recognised, at [75], that “s 29(3) impinges upon ordinary principles of natural justice.” That is, if I may say so respectfully, a very restrained way of putting it. The effect of section 29(3) is that, in those activities of the Tribunal concerning which it applies, the Tribunal is required to make a decision that may well affect an applicant for review in a serious way and result in the applicant losing his or her livelihood, without the existence or contents of some of the evidence against the applicant being disclosed to the applicant, and hence without the applicant having any opportunity to test, counter or qualify that evidence, or to make submissions about its significance. The question now before the Court involves whether the meaning of the words of section 29(3), properly understood, is such that that consequence arises concerning an application for a stay. 
     
      
    Relevant Provisions of the Administrative Decisions Tribunal Act 
     
      
    71 It appears to be a common assumption of the parties that it is legitimate to construe section 29(3) SI Act by reference to the provisions of the ADT Act. The application for review being one in the Administrative Decisions Tribunal, and section 29(3) making explicit reference to the Tribunal, that assumption is to that extent right. 
     
      
    72 Section 6(1)(c) ADT Act specifically includes revoking a licence in the word “decision”. Because of the provisions of section 29(1)(c) SI Act, the decision of the Commissioner to revoke the licences of the Appellants is a “reviewable decision” within the meaning of section 8 ADT Act. 
     
      
    73 Chapter 5 of the ADT Act runs from section 47 to section 66 inclusive. It is headed “process for review of reviewable decisions”. Part 2 of that Chapter, headed “role of administrators” runs from section 48-54 inclusive. It imposes obligations on an administrator who makes a reviewable decision. Those obligations arise before any process of review has started in the Tribunal, but are imposed for the evident purpose of facilitating review by the Tribunal, should an application for review be made. Section 49 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) If an administrator makes a reviewable decision, an interested person may make a written request to the administrator for the reasons for the decision. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) As soon as practicable (and in any event within 28 days) after receiving such a request, the administrator is to prepare a written statement of reasons for the decision and provide it to the person who requested the reasons. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) The statement of reasons is to set out the following:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the findings on material questions of fact, referring to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the administrator’s understanding of the applicable law, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the reasoning processes that led the administrator to the conclusions the administrator made.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    74 Section 15(7) SI Act qualifies that general obligation for an administrator to provide to an interested person reasons for not granting a licence. However, section 15(7) says nothing about the Commissioner being excused from the general obligation arising under section 49 ADT Act to provide reasons insofar as the Commissioner makes a decision to revoke an existing licence. 
     
      
    75 Section 55 ADT Act empowers a person to apply to the Tribunal for review of a reviewable decision, but only if certain preconditions in paras (a)-(d) are met.  
     
      
    76 Section 58 ADT Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) An administrator whose reviewable decision is the subject of an application for review to the Tribunal must, within 28 days after receiving notice of the application, lodge with the Tribunal:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) a copy of any statement of reasons given to the applicant under section 49 (or, if no such statement was given to the applicant, a statement of reasons setting out the matters referred to in section 49 (3)), and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) a copy of every document or part of a document that is in the possession, or under the control, of the administrator that the administrator considers to be relevant to the determination of the application by the Tribunal. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) If the applicant has not been given a statement of reasons under section 49, the Tribunal may direct that a copy of the statement of reasons lodged with the Tribunal under subsection (1) (a) be given to the applicant within such period or periods as the Tribunal directs.” 
        
       
      
    77 If the Commissioner had taken into account any information of the type described in section 15(6) SI Act (collectively “section 15(6) information”) in deciding to revoke a licence, then provision, pursuant to section 58(1) ADT Act, of the information described in section 49(3) ADT Act would require the Commissioner to inform the Tribunal of that information and, insofar as it was in documentary form, to provide it to the Tribunal. 
     
      
    78 The manner in which the Tribunal exercises its power under section 58(2) ADT Act to require a copy of that Statement of Reasons and any accompanying documents to be provided to the Applicant, will be influenced by whether section 29(3) SI Act prohibited the Tribunal from disclosing any section 15(6) information at the comparatively early stage of the review process at which section 58 ADT Act comes into operation.  
     
      
    79 Section 59 ADT Act empowers the Tribunal to excuse an administrator from what would otherwise be the administrator’s obligation under section 58(1). It provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) An administrator may apply to the Tribunal before the expiry of the period referred to in section 58 (1) for an order that the administrator not be required to lodge a copy of a document under section 58. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) On any such application, the Tribunal may make an order that a copy of a document not be lodged with the Tribunal if:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) it is satisfied that section 125 operates so as not to require the disclosure of the document, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) it considers that, if an application were made under section 75 (2), it would be appropriate to make an order under that subsection prohibiting or restricting the publication or disclosure of evidence of the document.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    80 The power of the Tribunal to stay a reviewable decision arises under section 60 ADT Act, which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Subject to this section, an application to the Tribunal for a review of a reviewable decision does not affect the operation of the decision under review or prevent the taking of action to implement that decision. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) On the application of any party to proceedings for an application for a review of a reviewable decision, the Tribunal may make such orders staying or otherwise affecting the operation of the decision under review as it considers appropriate to secure the effectiveness of the determination of the application. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) The Tribunal may make an order under this section only if it considers that it is desirable to do so after taking into account:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the interests of any persons who may be affected by the determination of the application, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) any submission made by or on behalf of the administrator who made the decision to which the application relates, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the public interest. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (4) While an order is in force under this section (including an order that has previously been varied on one or more occasions under this subsection), the Tribunal may, on application by a party to the proceedings, vary or revoke the order by another order.” 
        
       
      
    81 Section 60 appears in Division 2 of Chapter 5, Part 3 of the ADT Act. That Division is headed “Effect of pending applications on reviewable decisions”.  
     
      
    82 Division 3 of Chapter 5, Part 3 of the ADT Act runs from section 63 to section 66. The heading of Division 3 is “Powers on review”. Section 63 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) In determining an application for a review of a reviewable decision, the Tribunal is to decide what the correct and preferable decision is having regard to the material then before it, including the following:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) any relevant factual material, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) any applicable written or unwritten law. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) For this purpose, the Tribunal may exercise all of the functions that are conferred or imposed by any relevant enactment on the administrator who made the decision. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) In determining an application for the review of a reviewable decision, the Tribunal may decide:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) to affirm the reviewable decision, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) to vary the reviewable decision, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) to set aside the reviewable decision and make a decision in substitution for the reviewable decision it set aside, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) to set aside the reviewable decision and remit the matter for reconsideration by the administrator in accordance with any directions or recommendations of the Tribunal.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    83 Section 64 ADT Act requires the Tribunal to take into account government policy in certain circumstances. Its obligation to do so is expressed, in both section 64(1) and (4), to operate “In determining an application for a review of a reviewable decision …”. 
     
      
    84 Section 75 ADT Act includes: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) If proceedings before the Tribunal are to be determined by holding a hearing, the hearing is to be open to the public. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) However, if the Tribunal is satisfied that it is desirable to do so by reason of the confidential nature of any evidence or matter or for any other reason, it may (of its own motion or on the application of a party) make any one or more of the following orders:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) an order that the hearing be conducted wholly or partly in private, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) an order prohibiting or restricting:  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) the disclosure of the name, address, picture or any other material that identifies, or may lead to the identification of, any person (whether or not a party to proceedings before the Tribunal or a witness summoned by, or appearing before, the Tribunal), or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) the doing of any other thing that identifies, or may lead to the identification of, any such person, 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b1) an order prohibiting or restricting the publication or broadcast of any report of proceedings before the Tribunal, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) an order prohibiting or restricting the publication of evidence given before the Tribunal, whether in public or in private, or of matters contained in documents lodged with the Tribunal or received in evidence by the Tribunal, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) an order prohibiting or restricting the disclosure to some or all of the parties to the proceedings of evidence given before the Tribunal, or of the contents of a document lodged with the Tribunal or received in evidence by the Tribunal, in relation to the proceedings.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    The Revocation Decision and the Stay 
     
      
    85 At the outset I should deal with a point concerning which the Court sought further submissions from the parties after the argument had concluded. It concerns two related matters. The first is how the orders of the Tribunal, ordering that there be a “stay” of the decision of the Commissioner, should be construed. The second is a more general one, concerning what sense should be made of the question at the heart of the present appeal, namely whether the provisions of section 29(3) SI Act apply to an application for a “stay” of an order revoking a licence under the SI Act. 
     
      
    86 The notice that the Commissioner served revoking the licences in question was dated 15 July 2009, was addressed to the Appellants and ASET, and stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “Pursuant to section 26 of the Security Industry Act, 1997, notice is hereby given that your Class 1ABC2ABD security licence and Master securities licences issued in the name of AVS Group of Companies Pty Ltd and ASET Security and Training Pty Ltd have been revoked.  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        The revocation of a licence means that you are no longer authorised to engage in any security activity in respect of the class of licence revoked.  
        
       
       
        
        Your licences must be surrendered to police upon service of this notice. Failure to do so constitutes an offence under Section 31 of the Security Industry Act 1997 …”  
        
       
      
    87 The effect of section 26 SI Act, when combined with the terms of the revocation notice, was that revocation of the licences took effect when the notice was served, on 23 July 2009. Thus, by the time that the Appellants and ASET lodged their application for review of the decision, and “stay” of the decision, on 29 July 2009, the revocation had already taken effect.  
     
      
    88 The application for “stay” that was lodged on 29 July 2009 was in a standard form of the ADT, headed: 
     
      
       
        
        APPLICATION FOR STAY OF A REVIEWABLE DECISION 
         
         
        Section 60 of the Administrative Decisions Tribunal Act 1997 
        
       
      
    89 The standard form included: 
     
      
       
        
        “GROUNDS FOR STAY APPLICATION 
        
       
       
        
        The reasons for seeking a stay of the decision are:” 
        
       
      
    90 The solicitors for the Applicants and ASET completed the space that followed by saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “The applicants AVS GROUP OF COMPANIES and ASET SECURITY AND TRAINING are both companies that need their licence to be able to trade. They cannot trade in any capacity without their master licence and as a result both companies will not be able to trade pending the outcome in the review and will suffer financial loss and damage. If the substantive matter is decided in favour of each of the Corporate Applicants then the decision will be of little weight as both applicants will have suffered irreparable loss and damage. The applicant Peter Sleiman requires his Security Licence to be able to hold the Master Licences for the corporate applicants. All applicants dispute the findings of the respondent and the action taken in the revoking of the various licences.” 
        
       
      
    91 Submissions that were made on behalf of the Appellants to Deputy President Hennessy, on the occasion she granted the stay, included submissions that: 
     
      
       
      – a prima facie case had been made out. 
       
      – the “stay” was appropriate to secure the effectiveness of the Tribunal’s ultimate order, as without it, success in the proceedings would be a Pyrrhic victory. 
       
      – “the Tribunal has been given power under section 60 to do what is necessary to avoid it also.” 
       
      – there was no evidence of irreversible prejudice to the respondent 
       
      – ceasing business would have a serious financial effect on Mr Sleiman and the employees of the three applicants. 
       
      
    92 The terms of the Tribunal’s order are extraordinarily terse. Relevantly, it said “Stay granted”. 
     
      
    McBride v Walton and its Effect 
     
      
    93 In McBride v Walton (New South Wales Court of Appeal, 27 August 1993, unreported) Handley JA considered a situation where the Medical Tribunal had ordered that the name of Dr McBride be removed from the Register of Medical Practitioners, and had not deferred the operation of that order until any future date. Dr McBride appealed to the Court against the order removing his name, and applied for a stay of the order of the Tribunal pending the hearing of the appeal. The power that the Court had on an appeal from the Medical Tribunal was to stay an order (and no more extensive than that). Handley JA held that the power to grant a stay was inadequate to achieve the re-registration or the reinstatement of a medical practitioner on the Register on an interim basis pending the hearing of the appeal.  
     
      
    94 Mr Gray submits that the present case is distinguishable from McBride v Walton. He submits, correctly, that by reason of section 29(1)(c) SI Act the relevant “decision” that can be the subject of appeal is the revocation itself, not the end of the mental processes that the Commissioner went through that resulted in the notice of revocation being served. That is also consistent with the terms of section 6(1)(c) ADT Act. Mr Gray submits that that is unlike the situation in McBride v Walton, where there was an order of the Tribunal, and a separate and later act (removal of Dr McBride’s name from the Register) that gave effect to that order. Mr Gray submits that a stay of the decision is thus a stay of the revocation itself. 
     
      
    95 I accept that there is the difference to which Mr Gray points between the present situation and that in McBride v Walton. However, that difference does not detract from the fact that the revocation had already taken place, as soon as the notice was served. It is possible to stay an order, if that order is one that, absent the stay, would have an effect in the future. However I doubt that it is correct to say that one can stay an action that has already taken place in the past. A different type of order to a stay is needed if one is to prevent an action that has already taken place in the past from having some particular effect in the future. 
     
      
    96 In the present case (unlike McBride v Walton), the Tribunal has a wider power than merely to grant a stay. It has power, under section 60(2) ADT Act, to “make such orders staying or otherwise affecting the operation of the decision under review as it considers appropriate to secure the effectiveness of the determination of the application.” That power is one that is wide enough to enable the Tribunal to temporarily reinstate a licence that has been revoked pending the hearing of an application for review of a decision to revoke the licence. 
     
      
    97 If a notice of revocation of a licence under the SI Act was served, which said that the revocation would take effect in 21 days after service, there may still be a problem in the Tribunal granting a stay, properly so called, before the 21 day period had expired. It might be argued that it is only when there is an application for review of a “decision” that a stay can be granted under section 60, and the relevant “decision” is the revocation itself. However, even if that argument is right it would be possible for a licensee to put itself into a situation where it was in a position to lodge an application for review, and an application for temporary reinstatement of the licence, to commence as soon as the Tribunal could make an order after the revocation became effective. Alternatively, it might be argued that the relevant “decision” is to revoke the licence in 21 days, and that that decision could be stayed by an order made before expiry of the 21 days. It is not necessary to decide which of those arguments is right. As well, I leave for further argument whether section 60(2) is wide enough to enable the Tribunal to restore a revoked licence with retrospective effect. 
     
      
    Construction of Tribunal’s Order for a “Stay” 
     
      
    98 The preferable view of the law is that an order of an administrative Tribunal, like an order of the court, can be construed in the light of the circumstances surrounding the making of the order, regardless of whether there is any ambiguity in the words of the order itself.  
     
      
    99 There have been some cases that have held that there must be ambiguity before surrounding circumstances are resorted to to construe an order (McNair Anderson Associates Pty Ltd v Hinch [1985] VR 309 at 312 per Southwell J, Repatriation Commission v Nation (1995) 57 FCR 25 at 33 per Beaumont J (with whom Black CJ Jenkinson J agreed); Blanch v British American Tobacco Australia Services Ltd (2005) 62 NSWLR 653 at 655 per Young CJ in Eq, and see PW Young, “Construing Court Orders” (1998) 72 ALJ 117). However, those cases were influenced by what was thought to be the approach to interpretation of contract adopted by Mason J in Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority (NSW) (1982) 149 CLR 337, especially at 352. There is some puzzle about whether Mason J in Codelfa consistently adhered to the view that it was only if there was ambiguity that one could resort to surrounding circumstances as an aid to construction of a contract: Franklins Pty Ltd v Metcash Trading Ltd [2009] NSWCA 407 at [17], [243]–[261]. In any event, in the time since Codelfa was decided in 1982, the High Court has moved away from requiring ambiguity before surrounding circumstances can be used as an aid to construction of a contract – the steps in that move are traced in Franklins v Metcash at [14]-18], [239]-[305]. Thus, the principles whereby extrinsic evidence can be used to construe a contract no longer provide analogical support for court orders being construed by reference to extrinsic evidence only if the order in question is ambiguous. 
     
      
    100 The Full Federal Court in Yates Property Corp Pty Ltd v Boland (1998) 89 FCR 78 at 78-79 approved the use of surrounding circumstances to construe an order, and in particular approved the use of the reasons for judgment as an available aid to interpretation even of an order of a court framed in unambiguous language (quoting the decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Queensland in Australian Energy Ltd v Lennard Oil NL (No 2) [1988] 2 Qd R 230) “because they form part of the context in which the order was made”.  
     
      
    101 In Athens v Randwick City Council [2005] NSWCA 317; (2005) 64 NSWLR 58 Hodgson JA (with whom Tobias J agreed) said at [28], in a part of his judgment dealing with construction of an order that had not been made by consent, that “in the case of orders made for reasons given in a judgment, one can have regard to the judgment and to other surrounding circumstances, including the pleadings”.   
     
      
    102 In Athens, Santow JA (with whom Tobias JA also agreed) made an important observation at [129]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The purpose of a court order is, ordinarily, to give  
        effect to 
          
        a judgment. The judgment is not some kind of penumbral context surrounding the order. Rather the judgment is the source of the order. A court order derives from its originating judgment, as a transfer of land derives from the underlying contract. The order must therefore conform to the judgment, with only such latitude as the judgment allows.” 
        
       
      
    103 At [133] Santow JA preferred the line of authority whereby: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the meaning of words in an order should in an appropriate case be considered by reference to the reasons for judgment, themselves finding their context in the overall proceedings: see for example  
        Australian Energy Ltd v Lennard Oil NL (No 2)

        Ecrosteel Pty Ltd t/as Packs Business Form Brokers v Pefor Printing Pty Ltd 
         (Santow J, 12 November 1997, unreported).” 
        
       
      
    104 In Owston Nominees No 2 Pty Ltd v Branir Pty Ltd (2003) 129 FCR 558 at [27] Allsop J (as His Honour then was) accepted that, to resolve by a process of construction an ambiguity in a court order, it can be appropriate to consider a wider range of material than those relied on in Athens, namely “the reasons, the pleadings and, if necessary, the evidence and how the case was conducted”. See generally the helpful discussion by Professor Tarrant in “Construing undertakings and court orders” (2008) 82 ALJ 82. 
     
      
    105 It should at once be recognised that for the parties to apply for, and the Tribunal ultimately to grant, a “stay” of the decision of the Commissioner to revoke the licence was an inapt use of language. If ever in the future the Tribunal wished to achieve the effect that a revocation of a licence that had already taken place, was to be treated as though it had not taken place, pending the hearing of an appeal against the decision to revoke, it would be highly desirable for the Tribunal, to achieve that effect by language that made clear what the Tribunal was doing, such as that “the licence for all purposes be treated as on foot pending the hearing of the appeal”. As well as clarity, use of such language has the effect of helping to make clear the seriousness of such an order. 
     
      
    106 In the present case it is important for the parties to know, for the purpose of deciding their course of action in the immediate future, whether the order for a stay granted by Deputy President Hennessy on 13 August 2009 has any legal effect. As the matter has been addressed in supplementary submissions before us, and the parties will need to know the status of the present order for a “stay”, the duty of this Court to conduct proceedings so that “all matters in controversy between the parties may be completely and finally determined, and all multiplicity of legal proceedings concerning any of those matters avoided” (section 63 Supreme Court Act 1970) suggests we should decide its status. As well, the whole of the proceedings before us were conducted on the basis that to ask whether section 29(3) was capable of applying in the course of an application for a stay of a decision of the Commissioner that had revoked a licence under the SI Act was to ask an intelligible question. Construing the Deputy President’s order will assist in clarifying the more general question of construction, identified at [47] above, that is before us. 
     
      
    107 It is unnecessary to consider whether the Deputy President’s order of 13 August 2009 is on its face ambiguous before turning to at least some of the context in which it was made for help in its construction. The order was made in a proceeding initiated by the application for a “stay” that I have quoted at [88]-[90] above. In her reasons for granting the “stay” the Deputy President stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “The first question that arises is whether a stay is necessary to secure the effectiveness of the hearing. The evidence on the last occasion was that if the two companies and Mr Sleiman as an individual were unable to trade pending the hearing of this matter there would be losses to the business, that employees would have to be stood down and it stands to reason if these businesses and Mr Sleiman himself don’t have the licences that they need in order for them to trade there will be irredeemable losses.” 
        
       
      
    108 She also said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The final matter that Mr Lynch said I should have regard to was the length of time … until the substantive hearing … would take place. … Assuming that 21 days is the maximum amount of time … until a hearing takes place and that a decision is made shortly after that time, I do not consider that to be a lengthy period to allow the applicants to continue trading with the benefit of their licences.” 
        
       
      
    109 The combination of the terms in which the application for stay was made, and these passages of the Deputy President’s reasons, make clear that the Deputy President thought that the effect of her order was to enable the applicants before her to continue trading, as though with a licence, until the Tribunal had determined the application for review. There are also various passages in the submissions of the parties that lead to the same conclusion. In those circumstances it is unnecessary to decide whether the context available for construing an order extends as far as the submissions: cf Siminton v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority [2008] FCAFC 90 at [23]-[26].  
     
      
    110 If a literal meaning is given to the word “stay”, the whole of the proceedings in the Tribunal seeking a “stay”, the decision of the Appeal Panel relating to whether section 29(3) applied in an application for a “stay” of an order that had revoked a licence, and the later decision of Deputy President Hennessy that granted a “stay” were total exercises in futility, because a “stay”, in the literal sense, of such a decision would be legally of no effect. In all these circumstances the order of the Deputy President should be construed as though “stay” meant, in substance, an order that the licence be treated as on foot for all purposes pending the determination of the appeal. It is a matter for the parties whether they see any occasion to ask the Tribunal to correct the terms of its order under section 87 ADT Act to accord with the evident intent of the order. 
     
      
    Meaning of the Question of Construction Before the Court 
     
      
    111 Similarly, the proceedings in this Court ask an intelligible question only if they are treated as relating, in substance, to whether the Tribunal, when hearing an application that there be an interim restoration of a licence that has been revoked, is bound by section 29(3) SI Act.  
     
      
    112 Mr Gray’s primary submission is that the order for a “stay” understood in its usual sense was adequate both to stop the revocation having effect and to restore the licence temporarily. However as I understand it he also adopts a fallback position whereby if the Court did not agree with his primary submission (as I do not), we should treat the question of construction posed for this Court in the manner I have just indicated. I shall treat it in that way. 
     
      
    113 Because all the decisions below, and the submissions before us, have talked of the decision that was sought in the Tribunal as being a “stay”, when they mean in substance a decision that the licence be treated as on foot pending the determination of the appeal, I shall continue to use that language when the parties or the court below or the Tribunal have used it. However, in discussing the matter myself I will use the term “section 60(2) order”.  
     
      
    114 Mr Lynch submitted that the decision of the Deputy President on 13 August 2009 should be construed as an interim revival of the licences that had been revoked, rather than an interim grant of a new licence. While that submission may be correct, it is unnecessary to decide it. 
     
      
    115 I will now turn to the substance of the questions that were argued before us.  
     
      
    Judge’s Mischaracterisation of Appeal Panel Decision? 
     
      
    116 The Appeal Panel held, at [33] of its decision, that “the learned Deputy President was not entitled to take into account the criminal intelligence material provided to her by the Respondent on the determination of the question of a stay.” The Deputy President had received that material at a part of the “stay” hearing that was held in camera, with the applicants for review excluded from the hearing room. As I understand the decision of the Appeal Panel, it was to the effect that receiving the evidence in this manner, when receiving it in that manner was not authorised by section 29(3), made the hearing before the Deputy President miscarry. 
     
      
    117 Mr Gray SC submits that Rothman J mischaracterised the decision of the Appeal Panel, and thus was led into error. His Honour said, at [36]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Appeal Panel determined that, in the course of an interlocutory proceeding relating to a stay, her Honour had no power or ability to take account of material without disclosing its contents.” 
        
       
       
      A similar statement appears at para [53] of the reasons.  
       
      
    118 I agree that this is a mischaracterisation of the Appeal Panel’s decision. The Appeal Panel recognised at [33] of its decision that section 75 ADT Act empowered the Tribunal to make an order restricting, inter alia, the disclosure to some or all of the parties to the proceedings of evidence given or the contents of a document lodged with the Tribunal, or received in evidence by the Tribunal. Further, it there recognised that that power under section 75 is exercisable in “proceedings before the Tribunal” and thus is exercisable on an application for a section 60(2) order. The Appeal Panel pointed out that the Deputy President had not approached the matter on the basis of section 75, but rather on the basis that section 29(3) SI Act mandated her course of conduct. According to the Appeal Panel, the Deputy President’s error lay in believing that section 29(3) mandated her course of conduct. The Appeal Panel did not hold that the Deputy President had no power or ability to take account of the material without disclosing its contents. 
     
      
    119 The Appellants also criticise another related aspect of the reasoning of Rothman J. His Honour held, at [48], that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… no stay proceedings could utilise the material without disclosing it. This must be inconsistent with the purpose of s 29(3) of the Act.” 
        
       
      
    120 I accept the Appellants’ submission that this reasoning cannot be accepted. The reasoning does not take account of the possibility that, even if section 29(3) SI Act does not apply to proceedings seeking a section 60(2) order, in an appropriate case, confidential material could be received by the Tribunal and, through exercise of the Tribunal’s powers under section 75 ADT Act, the Tribunal might decide it was appropriate that that material not be disclosed to an applicant for review. 
     
      
    121 Even though the Appellants are right in identifying these flaws in the reasoning process adopted below, it is another question whether the conclusion at which the learned judge arrived is wrong. 
     
      
    Granting “Stay” a Different Function? 
     
      
    122 Mr Gray’s principal submission is that when the Tribunal is deciding a “stay” application, it is engaging in a discrete and separate function to that of determining an application for review of a reviewable decision. Thus, because the obligation under section 29(3) SI Act applies only “in determining an application for a review”, it does not apply when the Tribunal is deciding whether to grant a “stay”. 
     
      
    123 Mr Gray submits that the distinction between the function that the Tribunal is performing in deciding whether to grant a “stay”, and the function it is performing when actually determining an application for review, is marked by the structural division in the ADT Act between Division 2 and Division 3 of Chapter 5 Part 3. The distinction is also marked, he submits, by a difference in the obligations to adduce evidence that arise concerning the different functions – section 58(1)(b) ADT Act imposes a positive duty on the original decision-maker to place documents and information before the Tribunal, that the Tribunal can then take into account in deciding the application for review, while the original decision-maker has no obligation to place anything before the Tribunal for the purpose of a “stay” application.  
     
      
    Section 29(3) SI Act Alone 
     
      
    124 I will start considering that submission by construing the language of section 29(3) alone. As Eichelbaum CJ, Hardie Boys and Holland JJ said in the New Zealand Court of Appeal in R v S [1993] 2 NZLR 143 at 149, “the word ‘determining’ indicates a process, a continuing action, rather than the conclusion of the process which is the ‘determination’.” The opening phrase of section 29(3) means, “in the course of the process that constitutes determining an application for a review”.  
     
      
    125 However, clarifying the meaning of the phrase to that extent does not decide what are the limits of the process of determining an application for a review. Mr Gray accepts that that process includes the Tribunal hearing argument, and giving reasons. Consistently with Commissioner of Police v Gray, he accepts that it extends to deciding whether to require that an applicant for review be provided with particulars of the allegations. However, he submits it does not extend to the subsidiary interlocutory activity of deciding whether to grant a “stay”. 
     
      
    126 I do not agree that, as a matter of ordinary English, the meaning of the disputed phrase is limited in this way. 
     
      
    127 One needs to recall that there is no reason why an action that the Tribunal carries out can be described in only one way. As a matter of ordinary language, there is no inconsistency between the one action being done in determining an application for review, and also done in determining an application for a section 60(2) order. So long as it can be described as done “in determining an application for a review”, within the meaning of the statute, the obligations of section 29(3) attach. It is somewhat like the way in which, in Federal constitutional law, a challenged law is within the power of the Federal parliament if it can be described as “a law … with respect to” one of the heads of power listed in section 51 of the Constitution, even if it can also fairly be said to be “with respect to” some topic which does not appear in section 51: Herald and Weekly Times Ltd v The Commonwealth [1966] HCA 78; (1966) 115 CLR 418 at 434. 
     
      
    128 Under the ADT Act, the process of reviewing a reviewable decision starts when the application for review is filed under section 55. Everything that the Tribunal thereafter does concerning that application for review can, as a matter of ordinary language, legitimately be called actions carried out “in determining an application for a review…”. 
     
      
    Section 29(3) in the Context of the Statute 
     
      
    129 I do not see anything in the language of the rest of the statute that requires the meaning of “In determining an application for a review” to be narrowed, so that it excludes actions done in determining an application for a section 60(2) order. The power to grant a stay or other order affecting the operation of the decision, that arises under section 60(2) ADT Act, like power to make any interlocutory order in proceedings, exists so that a party to the proceedings can seek relief for the purpose of advancing claims which a party is already making in those proceedings: Haviland v McLeary (1894) 15 LR (NSW) (Eq) 22 per Owen CJ in Eq; Phillips v Walsh (1990) 20 NSWLR 206 at 209–210 per McLelland J; Spies v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (1991) 24 NSWLR 691 at 697 per Handley JA; St George v Wallis [2001] NSWSC 23 at [58] per Rolfe J; Re Jay-O-Bees; Rosseau v Jay-O-Bees [2004] NSWSC 818; (2004) 50 ACSR 565 at [64]-[72] per Campbell J. There is an express statutory power for the Tribunal to grant or refuse a stay or other order “as it considers appropriate to secure the effectiveness of the determination of the application.” In other words, the purpose of granting a stay or other order is connected with the determination of the application. “[S]ecur[ing] the effectiveness of the determination of the application” involves matters such as ensuring that the lapse of time before the determination is actually made does not deprive the review of practical point. It also involves considering the possibility that the result of the review might be that the decision is affirmed, with the consequence that if a section 60(2) order is granted the decision that the review ultimately decides was correct has not been implemented during the period of the section 60(2) order.  
     
      
    130 That a section 60(2) order is granted only at a time when an application for review is on foot, and is granted as an interlocutory order in that application for review for the purpose of that eventual determination being effective, supports it being a proper use of language to say that the section 60(2) order is granted “in determining an application for a review …” 
     
      
    131 The self-same words as the introductory words of section 29(3) SI Act (or a phrase not materially different to them) appear in section 63(1) and (3) and section 64(1) and (4) ADT Act. I recognise that sections 63 and 64 are concerned with how the Tribunal is to operate when it is at the stage of reaching a decision on making orders on application for review. However, that does not mean that the Tribunal is only engaged “in determining an application for a review” when it is at the stage of reaching a decision or making orders. 
     
      
    132 Thus, on the basis of the words of the statute alone, I would tentatively conclude that section 29(3) SI Act applies to proceedings that seek a section 60(2) order. 
     
      
    Context 
     
      
    133 The process of construction of a statutory provision is not a matter of linear reasoning. Rather, it is a process of coming to an understanding of the meaning of the provision. As I endeavoured to explain in Thomas v State of New South Wales [2008] NSWCA 316; (2009) 74 NSWLR 34 at [22]: 
     
      
       
        
        “… statutory construction is a particular application of the concept of the hermeneutic circle, familiar in other areas of discourse. That concept is that understanding of the parts is dependent upon understanding the larger whole, but the larger whole can only be understood on the basis of the parts, so that arriving at an understanding of any particular part involves movement to and fro between the parts and the whole. In the context of statutory interpretation, the  
        ‘whole’  
        that can influence understanding of one of the parts includes not only the entire text of the particular statute in question, but also matter such as the historical circumstances from which it sprang, and the purpose it is intended to achieve. That is because a statute is not a text that can be understood in isolation. It is a type of text that is intended to form part of a wider body of law, so the meaning of a particular statutory expression can be influenced by parts of the law that are beyond the statute. A statute is a type of text whose role is to regulate certain types of human activities, so the manner in which the relevant type of activity is carried out, and the purposes for which the statute seeks to regulate that type of activity, can also influence the meaning given to a particular statutory expression. 
        
       
      
    134 In carrying out that process, considering the words of the provision in question is the appropriate starting place. However, if (in the words of Brennan CJ in Newcastle City Council v GIO General Ltd (1997) 191 CLR 85 at 92) “a literal interpretation … produces absurdity”, that provides a reason for reconsidering that literal interpretation. To similar effect are Mason and Wilson JJ in Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1981) 147 CLR 297 at 320: 
     
      
       
        
        “There are cases in which inconvenience of result or improbability of result assists the court in concluding that an alternative construction which is reasonably open is to be preferred to the literal meaning because the alternative interpretation more closely conforms to the legislative intent discernable from other provisions in the statute.” 
        
       
      
    135 However, there are limits to the extent to which contextual matters can affect the construction. In Newcastle City Council v GIO General McHugh J said, at 112: 
     
      
       
        
        “… a court is permitted to have regard to the words used by the legislature in their legal and historical context and, in appropriate cases, to give them a meaning that will give effect to any purpose of the legislation that can be deduced from that context. The context includes reference to the provision’s legislative history and the relevant reports of law reform bodies which detail the perceived evil requiring reform.”  
        
       
      
    136 However, as McHugh J said 113, there is a limit to that process: 
     
      
       
        
        “Extrinsic material cannot be used to construe a legislative provision unless the construction of the provision suggested by that material is one that is ‘reasonably open’.” 
        
       
      
    137 It is the words that decide whether the construction is ‘reasonably open’. Consistently with that methodology, I now turn to examine other factors that may be relevant to section 29(3). 
     
      
    138 The context (including purpose) of a statutory provision should be considered as an aid to construction of the statute, even if ambiguity is not detected in the words of some disputed provision: CIC Insurance Ltd v Bankstown Football Club Ltd (1997) 187 CLR 384 at 408; Newcastle City Council v GIO General Ltd (1997) 191 CLR 85 at 112-113; Network Ten Pty Ltd v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd (2004) 218 CLR 273 at 280-281, [11]; K-Generation Pty Ltd v Liquor Licensing Court (2009) 237 CLR 501 at 521, [52]; Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 381, [69].  
     
      
    139 The purpose of section 29(3) can be inferred from other provisions of the SI Act, and from information about the context in which the SI Act would operate. One relevant aspect of the context, of which Parliament could be taken to be aware, is that the Commissioner is the administrative head of a large governmental organisation, that in the ordinary course of its operation comes across a wide variety of information concerning criminal activities, the sorts of circumstances in which criminal activities can arise, and the identity of people involved in criminal activities and the associates of those people. Another is that police investigation of criminal activities, particularly organised criminal activities, can take extended periods of time, and involve making a mosaic of information drawn from various sources. Another is that, while there are varied types of work that people engaged in security activities carry out, much of it is related to prevention or detection of crime, and thus might provide the opportunity for participation in or facilitation of crime. Another relevant part of the context is the pre-existing law concerning public interest immunity. Such immunity can attach to evidence of the identity of police informers and police internal documents. In particular there can be a public interest immunity concerning disclosure of documents that could reasonably be thought to jeopardise the operation of the police force (Cross on Evidence, 8th Aust ed, 2010, para [27105]) (now embodied in section 130 Evidence Act 1995 so far as the adducing evidence in court is concerned). 
     
      
    140 In Commissioner of Police v Gray, McColl JA (with whom Giles and Tobias JJA agreed) summarised, at [77]-[78], some aspects of the modern law concerning public interest immunity, including that where a claim of public interest immunity is upheld, the information the subject of the immunity is not available as evidence to be taken into account in deciding the outcome of the proceedings. She continued, at [79]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Section 29(3) was enacted against this common law background. It is apparent that it was intended to modify the application of the principles of public interest immunity as they might otherwise have applied in an external review of a refusal or revocation of a licence. It ensured that a successful s 29(3) claim did not, as would a successful public interest immunity claim, preclude the Tribunal from considering relevant s 15(6) materials pursuant to ss 58(1)(b) and 63 of the  
        ADT Act 
        .” 
        
       
      
    141 Another relevant aspect of a legal background against which the SI Act was enacted is that the Commissioner, as an officer in the executive arm of the government, is subject to a legal duty to give reasons for his or her decisions only to the extent that there is a statute imposing that duty on him or her: Public Service Board (NSW) v Osmond (1986) 159 CLR 656. The enactment of section 15(7) SI Act makes express provision exempting the Commissioner from any legal requirement that there otherwise might be for him or her to disclose the existence or content of any section 15(6) information in the course of giving reasons for not granting a licence under that Act. Davies J has pointed out in AVS Group of Companies Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Police [2009] NSWSC 1391, at [35] and [75], that when Parliament amended section 29 by adding subsection (3) in 2005, it did not make any amendment to section 15(7), to expressly excuse the Commissioner from any obligation to give reasons for revocation of an existing licence if giving those reasons would disclose section 15(6) information. However, the significance of no reference to revocation of a licence having been included in section 15(7) is limited, if one bears in mind, that under the general law the Commissioner had no obligation to give such reasons in any event.  
     
      
    142 A decision-maker has frequently been held to be under a general law obligation to accord natural justice in deciding to revoke an existing licence (FAI Insurances Ltd v Winneke (1982) 151 CLR 342). However, litigation in court would be needed if someone whose existing licence under the SI Act had been revoked wished to allege that a failure to give him the opportunity to put submissions about a matter that the Commissioner regarded as a reason for revoking the licence meant that the decision was arrived at in breach of natural justice. (I say nothing about the prospects of success of any such application, beyond noting that there are some circumstances in which a prima facie right to a hearing gives way to a public interest in secrecy: eg Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service [1985] AC 374; Edelsten v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1989) 85 ALR 226.) Further, even if litigation were brought against the Commissioner alleging a breach of natural justice or some other failure to adhere to administrative law standards, any attempt to obtain section 15(6) information through use of court procedures might be met by a claim of public interest privilege.  
     
      
    143 For these reasons, the Commissioner had a significant capacity, in the course of other proceedings, to protect his section 15(6) information. 
     
      
    144 The right conferred by section 29 to seek a review in the Tribunal of, inter alia, a decision to revoke a licence, conferred on the holder of the licence an avenue for seeking review that had not previously existed. The prior legislation, the Security (Protection) Industry Act 1985, conferred, in section 15, a right of appeal to a magistrate sitting alone against a decision of the Commissioner to cancel a licence. In such proceedings, it would be a matter for the Commissioner whether to dispense with any confidentiality that attached to section 15(6) information in his possession and tender it in the proceedings. If the Commissioner decided not voluntarily to place the material before the magistrate, and the appellant sought to obtain access to the material through subpoenas, it would be for the Commissioner to decide whether to oppose access being granted on the ground of public interest immunity. If the Commissioner did not tender the evidence, or if he succeeded in an application to have public interest immunity accorded to the evidence, the appeal would be decided on evidence that did not include that section 15(6) information. 
     
      
    145 The nature of a right of review in the Tribunal of a decision to revoke a licence is quite different to the previous right of appeal to a magistrate. There is a statutory obligation on the Commissioner, pursuant to section 58 ADT Act, to provide the Tribunal with all relevant information (unless excused from that obligation under section 59). That has the effect of altering the situation that had existed under the previous appeal system, where an appeal might be decided with highly relevant information not taken into account. To the extent that the Commissioner in making the original decision could take into account section 15(6) information without disclosing it to the licensee, so the Tribunal is placed in a position to do the same. Further, even if the Commissioner had an obligation, arising from the laws of natural justice, to disclose the substance of troubling information to the licensee and seek submissions about it before deciding to revoke the licence (a matter which I expressly decline to decide), section 29(3) makes clear that the Tribunal is not subject to any such obligation in determining an application for review. To that extent, section 29(3) effects an implied partial repeal of the Tribunal’s obligation to act in accordance with natural justice, arising under section 73(2) ADT Act: Commissioner of Police v Gray at [111]-[112], 29. 
     
      
    146 In considering the likelihood of the legislature having intended the prohibition in section 29(3) to apply throughout all aspects of an application for review of a decision to revoke the licence, one should bear in mind that under the pre-existing law the Commissioner had extensive power to keep section 15(6) information to himself, and the opportunity to seek a merits review in the Tribunal of the Commissioner’s decision revoking the licence involved conferring on a licensee a right it had not previously had. There is not the same reluctance to impute to the Parliament an intention to confer a right on restrictive terms, when those terms do not impinge on any pre-existing rights that the licensee had, as there would be to impute to Parliament an intention to cut down pre-existing rights.  
     
      
    Considerations of Practicality 
     
      
    147 Interpreting section 29(3) as applying to applications for a section 60(2) order assists in the coherent operation of the statutory scheme. If section 15(6) information had played a significant role in the Commissioner’s decision, and would be available to the Tribunal for the purpose of its final determination of the application, then the extent to which that information is not available to the Tribunal for the purpose of a hearing in which a section 60(2) order is sought the task of the Tribunal in deciding whether or not to grant such an order will be hampered. Inevitably, one of the factors that is relevant to whether a section 60(2) order should be granted is whether it is fairly arguable that the decision below was wrong. The Tribunal would be hampered in deciding that question if it were deprived of items of evidence that the Commissioner had found significant. 
     
      
    148 Further, section 60(3) ADT Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(3) The Tribunal may make an order under this section only if it considers that it is desirable to do so after taking into account:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the interests of any persons who may be affected by the determination of the application, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) any submission made by or on behalf of the administrator who made the decision to which the application relates, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the public interest.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    149 That makes it mandatory to take into account the public interest on an application for a section 60(2) order. The SI Act has as one of its significant objectives the protection of the public from unsuitable people working in the security industry. Again, the Tribunal could not take into account the extent to which the public interest might be affected by section 15(6) information in the possession of the Commissioner if that information were not before it on the application for a section 60(2) order.  
     
      
    150 The Appellants submit that their construction of section 29(3) SI Act does not prevent the Commissioner from placing the section 15(6) information before the Tribunal on a “stay” application. They submit that section 75(2)(d) ADT Act would allow material to be received on a “stay” application, with applicants and their legal advisors denied access to the documentation.  
     
      
    151 There may be room for argument about whether section 75(2)(d) permits not only the parties, but also their legal representatives, to be excluded from seeing certain evidence. Such an argument would need to take into account that it is very common for a superior court to receive confidential information on terms that it not be disclosed to a party, but can be disclosed to a legal representative of the party if that representative gives confidentiality undertakings to the court. The Tribunal might not have the same power as a superior court to receive such undertakings. Rather than resolve these matters, I shall assume, without deciding, that the scope of section 75(2)(d) is as wide as the Appellants submit. Even on that assumption, whether the Tribunal would make such an order in any particular case is a matter for the discretion of the Tribunal. When the Tribunal has a specific obligation under section 73(2) to observe the rules of natural justice, there would be an understandable reluctance on the part of the Tribunal to receive evidence, and act on it, when that evidence had not been considered, challenged, countered, or been the subject of submissions by one of the parties. In my view section 75(2)(d) does not provide a mechanism by which one could be confident that the Tribunal would have all relevant information before it for the purpose of hearing an application for a section 60(2) order, and that any section 15(6) information was not disclosed to the applicant for review or his or her legal representatives. 
     
      
    152 By contrast, section 29(3) SI Act enables the Tribunal to receive, evaluate, question, and if it thinks fit, act on such information, but imposes a mandatory requirement on the Tribunal concerning the disclosure of such information. 
     
      
    153 I recognise that section 29(3) does not impose on the Tribunal an obligation never to disclose or to permit the disclosure of section 15(6) information. Rather, the obligation is one that does not apply if the Commissioner approves otherwise. This has the effect that it is the Commissioner, not the Tribunal, who (subject to a qualification I will soon discuss) has the final say about whether such information should be disclosed. This is understandable policy, as the Commissioner may be in a position to know, when the Tribunal does not, that a piece of information that seems innocuous on its face could have detrimental consequences when viewed in conjunction with other information.  
     
      
    154 I said there was a qualification on the Commissioner’s final say on whether information is made available to an applicant for review. If, in proceedings in the Tribunal, a contention is raised that section 29(3) dictates the manner in which the Tribunal must deal with a particular piece of evidence, the Tribunal must satisfy itself about whether section 29(3) attaches to that particular piece of evidence. That in turn requires the Tribunal to decide whether an item of evidence tendered is section 15(6) information. In Gray, McColl JA, at [96] said that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… when a s 29(3) claim is made, it is necessary for the Tribunal to be satisfied that the information the appellant seeks to cloak with s 29(3) non-disclosure is properly classified as either ‘criminal intelligence’ or ‘criminal information’, is held in relation to the applicant and falls within one or other of s 15(6)(a)–(c). If any of these preconditions is not satisfied, s 29(3) does not apply.” 
        
       
      
    155 When the Tribunal was deciding those matters for itself, it is the effect of section 63(2) ADT Act that all references to “the Commissioner” in section 15(6) SI Act are replaced by references to “the Tribunal”.  
     
      
    156 When the Tribunal is deciding those matters for itself, the occasion for making a decision about whether section 15(6)(b) or (c) applies will not arise in the vast majority of cases. Satisfaction of the criteria in any one of paras (a), (b) or (c) of section 15(6), together with satisfaction of the requirements of the chapeau to section 15(6) is sufficient for evidence to fall within section 15(6). It is hard to see that information that causes the Commissioner (or the Tribunal) to conclude that improper conduct is likely to occur if the applicant were granted the licence, or information that causes the Commissioner (or the Tribunal) not to have confidence that improper conduct will not occur if the applicant were granted the licence, would not also be information that was relevant to the activities carried out under the class of licence sought by the applicant for the purposes of section 15(6)(a). The test of relevance is the one that, of the three alternative tests in paras (a), (b) and (c), will be most readily satisfied, in the vast majority of cases. 
     
      
    157 The other matter that the Tribunal has the capacity to decide for itself, for the purpose of deciding the applicability of section 29(3) SI Act, is whether the information that was tendered was a “criminal intelligence report”, or “other criminal information”, within the meaning of the chapeau of section 15(6). I do not see that there would be any particular difficulty in the Tribunal being able to characterise the material as inside, or outside, those descriptions. 
     
      
    158 Thus, the matters that the Tribunal must decide for itself, concerning the applicability of section 29(3), are quite simple. The scope for there to be disagreement between the Tribunal and the Commissioner about whether some particular piece of evidence is section 15(6) information will in practice be quite limited. 
     
      
    Extrinsic Evidence 
     
      
    159 Section 34 Interpretation Act 1987 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) In the interpretation of a provision of an Act or statutory rule, if any material not forming part of the Act or statutory rule is capable of assisting in the ascertainment of the meaning of the provision, consideration may be given to that material:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) to confirm that the meaning of the provision is the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision (taking into account its context in the Act or statutory rule and the purpose or object underlying the Act or statutory rule and, in the case of a statutory rule, the purpose or object underlying the Act under which the rule was made), or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) to determine the meaning of the provision:  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) if the provision is ambiguous or obscure, or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) if the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision (taking into account its context in the Act or statutory rule and the purpose or object underlying the Act or statutory rule and, in the case of a statutory rule, the purpose or object underlying the Act under which the rule was made) leads to a result that is manifestly absurd or is unreasonable.” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    160 Section 34(2)(e) and (f) Interpretation Act authorise the use of, respectively, an Explanatory Memorandum provided to Parliament before the Bill in question was enacted, and the Minister’s Second Reading Speech.  
     
      
    161 The Explanatory Memorandum to the Security Industry Amendment Bill 2005 identifies as one of the objects of the Bill: 
     
      
       
        
        “(h) to preserve the confidentiality of criminal intelligence concerning license applicants.” 
        
       
       
      It is not an object of only occasionally, or usually but not always, protecting the confidentiality of criminal intelligence concerning licence applicants.  
       
      
    162 It was para [47] of Schedule 1 of the Security Industry Amendment Act 2005 that introduced section 29(3) into the SI Act. The Explanatory Note relating to the Bill gave the following explanation concerning it: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Confidentiality of certain information 
        
       
       
        
        At present, section 15(6) of the Principal Act provides that, for the purpose of determining whether an applicant is a fit and proper person to hold the class of licence sought by the applicant, the Commissioner may have regard to certain criminal intelligence reports or other criminal information held in relation to the applicant. Section 26(1)(c) of the Principal Act provides for a licence to be revoked if the Commissioner is of the opinion that the licensee is no longer a fit and proper person to hold a licence. 
        
       
       
        
        Schedule 1 [47] 
         ensures the confidentiality of that information in the course of the Administrative Decision Tribunal reviewing a decision made under the Principal Act to refuse to grant a licence or to revoke a licence.” 
        
       
      
    163 That makes clear that the purpose of “ensur[ing] the confidentiality of that information” attaches to reviews of decisions both to refuse to grant a licence, and to revoke of the licence. It also makes clear that that purpose applies “in the course of the Administrative Decision Tribunal reviewing a decision”. The last mentioned expression suggests the entire course of reviewing the decision. Further, that the confidentiality of the information is something that section 29(3) “ensures” is not consistent with there being a risk of the confidentiality sometimes being displaced or eroded by an exercise of discretion of the Tribunal under section 75(2)(d) ADT Act. 
     
      
    164 The Second Reading Speech concerning the bill was given on 21 June 2005 by Mr Tony Stewart, a Parliamentary Secretary, on behalf of Mr Carl Scully. His speech included: 
     
      
       
        
        “When the Commissioner relies on police intelligence to refuse a licence application, the bill will also protect that intelligence from being released to unsuccessful applicants if they appeal to the Administrative Decisions Tribunal [ADT]. This provision is not designed to circumvent the appeals process or hinder the ADT or the courts in the exercise of their review functions. These bodies will still have the same opportunity to consider and weigh the probative value of the intelligence the Commissioner has relied on to make his decision. However, the bill will prevent the release of intelligence directly to the person to whom the intelligence relates. This will protect the safety of police informants and prevent the disclosure of police information holdings and the details of police methodology.” 
        
       
      
    165 Even though the first sentence of this extract deals only with the situation “when the Commissioner relies on police intelligence to refuse a licence application”, the last two sentences of the quote are not expressly limited to situations where there is an appeal from refusal of a licence application. As is common with second reading speeches, a variety of short points, not necessarily related, are made in the course of this paragraph of the speech. I do not read the last two sentences as limited to a situation where a licence application has been refused. 
     
      
    166 Each of these extrinsic aids to construction supports the view that the purpose sought to be achieved by the introduction of section 29(3) SI Act was providing a means of ensuring that the confidentiality of section 15(6) information was preserved whenever there was an appeal to the ADT concerning a licence.  
     
      
    167 The reasoning so far continues to support the view that the correct construction of section 29(3) is that the obligation it creates is one that applies in the course of the hearing of an application for a section 60(2) order 
     
      
    Practical Problems in Judge’s Construction of Section 29(3)? 
     
      
    168 The Appellants submit that there would be significant practical problems with section 29(3) applying in “stay” proceedings. As I understand it, the Appellants submit that it is unlikely that Parliament intended the Tribunal to carry out the exercise of deciding whether a particular piece of evidence was section 15(6) information, and thus within the scope of section 29(3), for the purpose of a “stay” application, given the great speed with which “stay” applications concerning, in particular, revocation of a licence, would need to be decided.  
     
      
    169 However, as explained at paras [154]-[158] above, the task that the Tribunal is likely to have to perform, in deciding whether a particular piece of evidence counts as section 15(6) information, is whether it has the characterisation of being a “criminal intelligence report” or “other criminal information”, and whether it is relevant to the activities carried on under the class of licence sought by the applicant. Those decisions are ones that courts and tribunals would usually have no difficulty in making.  
     
      
    170 In the rare circumstance of the Tribunal needing to decide whether a particular item of information fell within section 15(6)(b) or (c), that decision would be made, like any decision made for an interlocutory purpose, on a prima facie basis: cf Wendo v R (1963) 109 CLR 559 at 572-573; DPP v Alexander (1993) 33 NSWLR 482 at 493; Attorney General (NT) v Maurice (1986) 161 CLR 475 at 491; Cardile v LED Builders Pty Ltd (1999) 198 CLR 380 at [60], [64], [68]. It would be made on the basis of such evidentiary material as the Tribunal had before it at the time. While making a decision about whether section 15(6)(b) or (c) applied would involve some complexity, I do not see the task as being so complex that it is unlikely Parliament intended that it be done. 
     
      
    171 I accept the Appellants’ submission that it is readily foreseeable that a “stay” application could be made to the Tribunal very soon after the Commissioner had revoked a licence, and that the Tribunal would be called upon to decide that “stay” application expeditiously, and possibly to deliver its decision ex tempore. For the reasons I have given, however, I do not accept that the task of deciding whether section 29(3) applies is one that is so difficult that it is inherently unlikely to have been intended to be one carried out at speed. Thus, I do not accept that the practical difficulties in applying section 29(3) in an application for a section 60(2) order tend to show that Parliament did not intend section 29(3) to apply in such an application. 
     
      
    Inconsistency Between Section 59(1) and Application of Section 29(3) to “Stays”? 
     
      
    172 The Appellants also submit that section 59(1) of the ADT Act appears to contemplate that the Commissioner will have 28 days within which to make a section 29(3) SI Act non-disclosure claim. The need for speed in deciding a “stay” application, they submit, is inconsistent with that measured timetable. 
     
      
    173 I do not accept that argument. Section 59 ADT Act is directed to the circumstances in which an administrator can seek to be excused from what would otherwise be his or her obligation under section 58 to lodge a statement of reasons and relevant documents with the Tribunal, within 28 days of an application for review being initiated. The effect of a successful section 59 objection by an administrator is that any document to which it applies is not made available in that way to the Tribunal for the purpose of making its final decision.  
     
      
    174 The outcome of the operation of section 59 is different to the outcome of the operation of section 29(3) SI Act. Section 29(3) proceeds on the basis that the document in question is available to the Tribunal for the purpose of making its final determination, though access to that document and its contents has been restricted. I see no reason why the time limit imposed under section 59 should have any effect on the proper construction of section 29(3). 
     
      
    175 Further, sections 58 and 59 set out procedures that apply whenever an application for review of a reviewable decision is made to the Tribunal. An application for a section 60(2) order is made only if someone chooses to make it. There is nothing unusual about evidence needing to be provided, and decisions made, faster than in the ordinary run of cases when a special and urgent application, like that for a section 60(2) order, is made. 
     
      
    176 I see no disharmony between the existence of section 59 ADT Act, and section 29(3) SI Act as I construe it.  
     
      
    Authority 
     
      
    177 In Commissioner of Police v Gray McColl JA concluded, at [106]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Once the claim [that an item of evidence is section 15(6) information] is established, s 29(3)(a) operates to disentitle an applicant to knowledge of both the ‘existence and content’ of any s 15(6) material for the purpose of the external review. The applicant is thus denied access to materials which would otherwise be made available pursuant to s 58(5) and/or by the application of the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness in s 73. Nevertheless the Tribunal is required by s 63 to take it into account in its deliberations.” 
        
       
      
    178 While Gray was dealing with a different problem of statutory construction to the present one (namely whether section 29(3) affected the power of the Tribunal to order the provision of particulars), the generality of her Honour’s account of when section 29(3) applies, namely “for the purpose of the external review” is consistent with the conclusion at which I have arrived.  
     
      
    Conclusion 
     
      
    179 Section 29(3) applies to the activities of the Tribunal when hearing an application for a section 60(2) order that has the effect of temporarily reinstating a licence under the SI Act that has been revoked when that reinstatement is made pending the determination by the Tribunal of an application for review of that revocation. 
     
      
    Orders 
     
      
    180 The orders made in the Common Law Division, insofar as they were substantive orders in the appeal against the decision of the Appeal Panel were: 
     
      
       
        
        “(i) To the extent necessary, leave be granted to the Commissioner of Police to appeal the decision of the Administrative Decisions Tribunal, in the appeal by AVS Group of Companies Pty Ltd, ASET Security and Training Pty Ltd, and Mr Peter Sleiman, matter 099045, made on 11 August 2009; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) The decision of the Administrative Decisions Tribunal, in the appeal by AVS Group of Companies Pty Ltd, ASET Security and Training Pty Ltd, and Mr Peter Sleiman, matter 099045, made on 11 August 2009, be quashed; 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) The aforesaid appeal be remitted to the Administrative Decisions Tribunal to deal with in accordance with law.” 
        
       
      
    181 While I have reached the conclusion that construction that the judge placed on section 29(3) SI Act is right, there are three aspects of the orders in the Common Law Division require minor correction. The decision of Deputy President Hennessy refusing a “stay”, and the orders made on the appeal against that decision in the Appeal Panel, were clearly both interlocutory orders. There is no doubt that leave was needed to appeal from the Appeal Panel’s decision to the Supreme Court. Indeed, an aspect of Mr Gray’s argument (para [125]) depends on the decision being interlocutory. Thus the orders in the Supreme Court should clearly reflect that leave was needed to appeal to the Supreme Court against that decision. That requires modification of order (i).  
     
      
    182 Second, the process in the Supreme Court is (once leave has been granted) a statutory appeal against the decision of the Appeal Panel. Unlike the procedure involved in the making of orders in the nature of prerogative orders, such a statutory appeal does not involve the proceedings in the Appeal Panel being removed into the Supreme Court for review, the quashing of any orders found to have been erroneously made in the Appeal Panel, and return of the proceedings to the Tribunal to be dealt with in accordance with law. The difference between the statutory appeal, and the exercise of the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to grant orders in the nature of prerogative relief against the Tribunal is recognised in sections 122 and 123 ADT Act. Rather, the proceedings in the Supreme Court are of a nature defined by the statute that creates the right of appeal.  
     
      
    183 The scope of the orders that the Supreme Court can make on an appeal under section 119 ADT Act from the Appeal Panel of the Tribunal is set out in section 120 ADT Act: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) The Supreme Court is to hear and determine the appeal and may make such orders as it thinks appropriate in light of its decision. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The orders that may be made by the Supreme Court on appeal include (but are not limited to):  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) an order affirming or setting aside the decision of the Appeal Panel, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) an order remitting the case to be heard and decided again by the Appeal Panel (either with or without the hearing of further evidence) in accordance with the directions of the Supreme Court.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    184 The order that the ADT Act authorised was not to “quash” the decision of the Appeal Panel, but rather to set it aside. That requires modification of order (ii). 
     
      
    185 The reference in section 120(2)(b) to the Supreme Court “remitting” the case to be heard and decided again by the Appeal Panel needs to be understood as having a different shade of meaning to what is involved in “remitting” proceedings that have been removed into a superior court for prerogative review. In its context, it seems to mean merely that the Supreme Court has power to direct the Appeal Panel to hear again the case in which it made the decision appealed against. There is no occasion to make such a direction in the present case. That requires modification of order (iii).  
     
      
    186 The orders that the Appeal Panel had made were: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. Leave to appeal granted. 
         
        2. Appeal allowed. 
         
        3. Question of whether to grant a stay of the operation of the decision under review remitted back to Deputy President Hennessy for determination in accordance with law.” 
        
       
      
    187 It was after the Appeal Panel had made those orders on 11 August 2009 that Deputy President Hennessy heard the second application for a “stay”, and granted the “stay”. That second application for a “stay” miscarried in a fundamental way, because it proceeded on the basis that the Appeal Panel’s construction of section 29(3) was correct. However, the order that was made on that occasion remains on foot.  
     
      
    188 Mr Lynch has expressly declined to ask this Court to revoke or amend the “stay” order of 13 August 2009. Thus, it will be a matter for the parties (and ASET, which has the benefit of the order although it is not a party in this Court) to decide whether they wish to ask the Tribunal for that order to be varied or revoked, pursuant to section 60(4) ADT Act. 
     
      
    189 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (1) Leave to appeal granted. 
       
       
      (2) Direct that a Notice of Appeal, in the form of the draft Notice of Appeal contained in the White Book, be filed within 7 days. 
       
       
      (3) Vary the orders in the court below by replacing orders (i)–(iii) with orders reading:  
       
       
        
        (i) Grant leave to the Commissioner of Police, to appeal from the decision of the Administrative Decisions Tribunal, in the appeal by AVS Group of Companies Pty Ltd, ASET Security and Training Pty Ltd and Mr Peter Sleiman, in matter 099045 made on 11 August 2009; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) the decision of the Administrative Decision Tribunal, in the appeal by AVS Group of Companies Pty Ltd, ASET Security and Training Pty Ltd and Mr Peter Sleiman, in matter 099045 made on 11 August 2009, be set aside. 
        
       
       
      (4) Subject to order (3) above, appeal dismissed. 
       
       
      (5) Appellants to pay costs of the Respondent of the application for leave to appeal, and the appeal. 
       
      
    190 There is no occasion to make an order that the Appellants pay the costs of the proceedings before Rothman J, because an order of Rothman J to that effect remains on foot. 
     
      
    191 HANDLEY AJA: I agree with Campbell JA.

   JUDGMENTThe victim in of these offences is under the age of 16 years. Nothing is to be published which woud reveal his identity.1. The first trial appearing in the list at Bourke was the trial of Jodie Belinda Moore. It was a trial that was set down to take place and would take, I was told, four to five days on a conservative estimate. I indicated that I was contemplating relocating it to Dubbo because my experience is that when counsel say four to five days in reality these things tend to become six and seven day trials. 2. As events have turned out, this afternoon Jodie Belinda Moore has pleaded guilty to an indictment containing five counts of which she acknowledges her guilt in respect of two. She acknowledges that on 26 August 2007 at Brewarrina she entered a dwelling house with intent to commit a serious indictable offence; namely to intimidate J. F. She acknowledges her guilt that on 26 August 2007 at the same time and place she took J.F. without his consent and with intent to obtain an advantage; namely to obtain information concerning damage caused to a motorcycle. 3. When the indictment was read and nothing was in support of it my immediate reaction was that they were very serious offences indeed. An agreed fact puts an entirely different slant on those acknowledgments of guilt. 4. During the evening of Sunday, 25 August 2007 the motorbike of Ms Moore’s son, one Cecil Collis, was damaged by one Raymond Biles who was present with J. F., then aged fifteen. That damage to the bike was achieved by pouring a mixture of cordial, beer and salt into the petrol tank, beer into the muffler, salt and beer into the oil reservoir, the cutting of wires and the breaking of the spokes of the motorcycle. 5. I know no more about this motorcycle than that. Whether it was an expensive or a less expensive bike I know not, other than what I will say in a moment about money being provided for it. But the consequence of all of those acts made the bike inoperable. The following morning Jodie Moore became aware of the damage to her son’s bike. 6. 10.30 that morning she went to -- Young Street, Brewarrina where her friend, Veronica F. lived. Veronica F. was her best friend. They knew each other well for fifteen or sixteen years. They came and went into each other’s homes as though they were sisters. As she had done many times before, she entered the home. Veronica was not there. J. F. was there. He was there with his sister, Fallon; she is aged twenty-five. J. F.’s twin brother was there, and another persons, Luke Warraweena and Dayne Salt. 7. It would not be surprising that the offender was angry about what had happened to the son’s bike. To come shortly to the agreed facts it is she who had provided money for the bike. So there were two reasons for her to be angry: one because it had happened to her son, and two she had provided the money, whether as a gift or as a loan I know not. But on either view the gift or loan was suddenly made meaningless. 8. She entered the premises saying, “Where the fucking hell is Freaky?”, meaning Veronica F. “Your son fucked Pundu’s motorbike. Him and Ray Bunce” - a reference to Raymond Biles. She also said, “J--, you little cunt what did you do to Pundu’s motorbike?” 9. There is no doubt these comments were made and she acknowledges it, with the intention of causing him, J. F., to fear physical harm. He escaped out the back laundry window from the house. She went around the side of the premises with Fallon through the side gate and approached J. F. He told her and his sister that Raymond Biles had damaged the bike and that he was present with Biles at the time. She then took him without his consent in her vehicle with a view to seeing Raymond Biles or Biles’s mother, Lynette Fazledean, and then they were heading to Brewarrina Police Station to report the matter. 10. One view of it was that she had, in fact, arrested Frail and was taking him to the police, in which case her conduct would not have been unlawful. But [at trial] it would have been a jury question. The offender asserts that they also travelled to a house in 73 Bourke Street, Brewarrina, where she thought Veronica would be but there was no response at that place. They then went to 5 Narran Street, presumably still looking for Raymond Biles, because Erica Biles, a cousin, lives there. 11. Lynette Fazledean was out the front with other persons. J.F. escaped the vehicle and told Fazledean that Biles had damaged the bike. They then drove to Ms Moore’s premises at 3 Young Street before heading to Brewarrina Police Station to report the matter. Police interviewed J.F. concerning the events that occurred that morning and took a statement from him in the presence of his sister. 12. On 15 September 2007 Ms Moore attended Brewarrina Police Station. Apparently they wanted to speak to her in relation to this matter and she exercised her right of silence and was charged. 13. They are the facts that the Crown relies upon to sustain both counts. The Crown I should indicate has accepted the two pleas in full satisfaction of the other charges on the indictment. I have not referred to the other charges because I am dealing with the criminality that the Crown concedes is the appropriate criminality in the circumstances. 14. On any objective analysis these offences occur in circumstances where there was strong provocation, in circumstances where the offender lived within a community that accepted some responsibility for the way in which other persons’ children in the community behave. We tend in our [Cacuasian] community to evaluate and gauge things by the way white men work. In indigenous communities quite frequently those close to other families accept some responsibilities for the behaviour of other young people. Whether J.F. at fifteen would have qualified in that sense is a more moot point, but certainly if he had been six or seven one could have easily understood that sort of approach. 15. I am told that these offences do not carry a standard non-parole period. The level of malice involved in this criminality seems to me to be towards the lower end and is more related to discipline and compensation than it is to any harm intended to the victim. 16. Part of the agreed facts makes reference to some background matters insofar as Ms Moore is concerned. Her mother died when she was four and her father died when she was five. She resided at a children’s home called Bethcar. One Colin Frederick Gibson and his wife assisted in the running of this home. Those who have responsibility for running institutions, as I take it this place was, ought to be accountable to authorities, particularly authorities such as the Department of Community Services. In my view they ought to be licensed. 17. This is a very good example of why supervision of these homes is required. This offender was sexually abused by Gibson between the years 1976 and 1983; that is at a time when Ms Moore was six to thirteen years of age. That is well before pre-pubescence to pubescence. He was not tried until 2006 in relation to these charges. On 22 November 2006 at the Dubbo District Court in relation to the charges touching Ms Moore and another victim, a total of sixteen years imprisonment with an overall non-parole period of twelve years were imposed upon Gibson. 18. I will come to in some detail in the victim’s compensation report, but suffice to say at this point that the sum of $50,000 in victim’s injury compensation awarded to her for years of sexual abuse seems to me a paltry sum. Some of that money she used to purchase the motorcycle. 19. Ms Moore was born in Narrabri. There are two sisters and a brother. There are some other siblings having one parent different. She reports her mother died as I say when she was extremely young, and her father about a year later. She was not allowed to attend her mother’s funeral or visit the father in hospital or to know other members of the family. She attended the Brewarrina infants, primary and high schools while she was at this home. She said the children at the home were responsible for cleaning and on-farm chores. Some of the children were treated differently, some being favoured and others including her made to do a lot of work. 20. She ran away when she was coming close to sixteen to live with her sister. That sister died when she was sixteen after twelve months in a coma. She then got into a relationship it would seem where there was significant domestic violence from the age of sixteen. She has given birth to six children. In 2005 five of them were living with her but now I am told that there are three living with her and one that visits daily, and a grandson that lives with her. 21. She resides in a Department of Housing home near the centre of town. That home has been the target of invasions, theft of property and broken windows. She worries about her children and fears someone may sexually assault them by gaining access through the broken windows. Such of her family as live in Brewarrina are alcoholics. Her brother has been in and out of gaol. There are two sisters in Orange who do not drink. She has a long record herself of criminal offences, street fighting and the like as a consequence of abuse of alcohol. 22. She experiences epilepsy and is on Dilantin and Tegretol. She experiences body aches, is short-winded, and has pain in her left arm and chest. She suffers from light-headedness, aching legs, cramps and the like. All her births have been caesarean; she is unable to have normal vaginal deliveries. I should suspect that they may well be a consequence of the sexual assaults. She does abuse cannabis by the look of it. She suffered from enuresis from the age of seven until she left the home. That enuresis was fear of being sexually abused. 23. One of the lines I found most difficult to read was that she broke her own arm at an early age in order to escape the sexual abuse. 24. The opinion of the psychologist who interviewed her, with a lot of experience in dealing with victims of sexual assault makes this observation, which I accept: 
     
      
      “Ms Moore’s statement describes numerous episodes of physical and sexual abuse. There appears to have been little grooming involved with threats and physical abuse being the main strategy to maintain her silence. The sexual abuse appears to have been premeditated and violent with many of the incidents occurring at times when the offender would have been able to predict that the assault was either unlikely to be detected or any witnesses were unlikely to complain as they were also victims of the abuse.” 
       
      
    25. The abuse initially commenced with Gibson raping her at the pump house near a river within weeks of her arrival. That involved full sexual penetration. She bled significantly and not surprisingly was in tremendous pain. On her estimate she would have been subject to sexual assault fifty times a year all of those years she was there but it varied, she said, and was more of an average as sometimes it would occur a number of times a week and other times would not occur for weeks. The majority of the assaults involved full sexual intercourse with some lesser incidents described as consisting of digital penetration of her vagina. The report continues: 
     
      
      “The overall picture of the abuse is of a systematic, sometimes planned and sometimes opportunistic ongoing pattern of sexual abuse and physical abuse. The broader picture is of a context where Ms Moore and her peers tried on numerous occasions to get the authorities to help them but without success.”  
      
    26. She has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and it is what is called chronic or long-term. She says she thinks about the abuse every day. It clearly would be contributing to reactive depression, and the symptoms are persistent. Those include difficulty falling or staying asleep, irritability or outbursts of anger, difficulty concentrating, hyper-vigilance and exaggerated startled response. It is the second of those symptoms which has some part to play in this offending. Just to remind you it was irritability or outbursts of anger. On this occasion there was such an outburst of anger. It was prompted by the consequence of damage to the motorcycle and what it meant to her and what she knew it meant to her son. 27. It being a factor, that is, having some of its origins not just in the events that unfolded in 2007 but because of events that had earlier unfolded and being a consequence of the disease, it seems to me that that mitigates the objective criminality of the offence. 28. There has been discussion between the parties and myself as to the appropriate outcome. The Crown concedes that a s 9 [good behaviour] bond would be an appropriate penal outcome, but when pressed as to whether a s 10 discharge would be appealable the Crown indicated it was a matter for me. 29. When a judge comes to sentence someone he or she can keep in mind a range of available sentences and impose a sentence within that range and not fall in error. In speaking of a range, the range must have a lower end and must have an upper end. The question is whether a dismissal falls within the lower end. In deciding whether to make an order dismissing the charge the court is to have regard to the following factors: the person’s character, antecedents, age, health and mental condition. 30. As to the character, I have given a good insight of the character. The offender’s involvement with Veronica, how she has managed to stay in the community notwithstanding the horrific start she had to her life, the contribution she is making in raising six children, her generous nature in giving to her son the wherewithal to purchase the bike even if it be a loan. 31. Her antecedents do her no great credit because she clearly has a drinking problem, one can understand that both by way of the fact that within the Aboriginal communities alcohol is a scourge, and secondly because in her own particular case there must be some degree of self-medication involved. She has not been before the District Court before and all of her offending as best I can tell is alcohol related but for a shoplifting charge. 32. Her health and mental condition. She suffers from post-traumatic stress as I have just said. There may be some borderline personality disorder symptoms. If there be those, they too would well have their origin in seven or eight years of sexual abuse of her. 33. The offences charged are serious offences. The word “trivial” is probably not an appropriate word to describe them but they certainly do fall within the lower dynamics and the lower range of offending, and it seems to me that in respect of both of them there were available defences and it would not have surprised me had a jury considered long and hard whether the Crown had proved the guilt of the accused. 34. I am satisfied the circumstances in which these offences were committed can properly be described as extenuating and any other matter that the court thinks proper. As a consequence of the way this event has been handled, as the Crown himself has said, this is a matter that could have been resolved really by mediation. If it had to be resolved by criminal charges it would better have been resolved by criminal charges in the Local Court. In all the circumstances I take the view that I would not be falling into error to discharge Ms Moore from either of these matters pursuant to s 10. 35. Ms Moore, if you are up to it, I want you to stand up. In respect of the offence that you on 26 August 2007 at Brewarrina in the State of New South Wales did enter a dwelling house with the intent to commit a serious indictable offence, namely to intimidate J. F., I find you guilty of that offence. But pursuant to s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act I discharge you from that offence without convicting you.36. In respect of the other offence that you pleaded guilty to, at the same time and place that you took J. F. without his consent and with the intent to obtain an advantage, namely obtain information concerning damage caused to the motorcycle, again I find you guilty of the offence. But pursuant to s 10 I discharge you without recording a conviction.Any other matter?SIMPSON: Yes, there’s S.166 matters, your Honour, backup offences. HIS HONOUR: 166?SIMPSON: Yes, if they could be dismissed. There was an enter dwelling with intent to assault and a common assault. HIS HONOUR: What do you want me to do with those?SIMPSON: Dismiss them? HIS HONOUR: Those matters on the application of the Crown pursuant to 166, I have the power and I dismiss each of them.

     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
    1 BASTEN JA: This matter involves an application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed on the applicant by Sorby DCJ, the circumstances of which are sufficiently recounted by Barr J, with whose reasons I agree. There were, in substance, two complaints concerning the attention paid by the sentencing judge to evidence of the applicant’s psychological ill-health. That material was relevant in two ways. First, it had the potential to affect an assessment of the applicant’s moral culpability with respect to her involvement in the offences to which she pleaded guilty. Secondly, it provided a basis for an inference that, if she received a custodial sentence, the sentence would weigh more heavily on the applicant than would be expected in the case of a reasonably healthy person. 
     
      
    2 At the hearing of the application, further evidence was tendered, by way of a report prepared by a psychiatrist, Dr John Roberts, as to the state of her health in prison. The Director objected to the tender, partly on the basis that he had not had an opportunity to obtain a further report from his own psychiatrist, Dr Allnutt. On the basis that the Director would be given an opportunity to obtain another report, the further psychiatric evidence was admitted. A supplementary report from Dr Allnutt was tendered, with a short submission, on 6 May 2008. A supplementary submission in response from the applicant was received on 8 May 2008. 
     
      
    3 The further material was not before the trial judge and is not relevant to a determination of error on his Honour’s part. As explained by Barr J, there was significant material before the sentencing judge capable of supporting an inference that the applicant would in fact suffer a deterioration in her psychological health from a significant period of imprisonment. His Honour failed to give proper consideration to that factor in his reasons, which was an omission warranting intervention by this Court. The further evidence was admissible in the exercise of this Court’s function in re-sentencing the applicant, error having been otherwise established. 
     
      
    4 Taking the further evidence into account for that purpose, a reduction in sentence is warranted, as demonstrated by Barr J. I agree with the orders his Honour proposes. 
     
      
    5 BARR J: Amelia Du Randt has applied for leave to appeal against a sentence which was imposed in the District Court after she pleaded guilty to the charge that between about 28 December 2005 and 31 May 2006 at Sydney and elsewhere in New South Wales and in Queensland she dealt in money that was proceeds of crime and was reckless as to the fact that the money was proceeds of crime and at the time of the dealing the value of the money was $100,000 or more. The resulting sentence was of imprisonment for three years and three months, commencing on 28 September 2007 and expiring on 27 December 2010, incorporating a non-parole period of two years expiring on 28 September 2009. The charge was laid under s400.4(2) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Commonwealth). The maximum applicable sentence was imprisonment for ten years. 
     
      
    6 The applicant was acquainted with a number of people who were concerned in the importation of amphetamine and the distribution of the proceeds of its sale. Some of them were Danielle Maio, Medhi Mohammadi, also known as Nick, Andrew Labanon, Lisa Dunn, Taro Zion Joy and Shane Cooper. During the period between June and December 2005 the applicant and Dunn spoke to one another on the telephone a number of times. On 8 June 2005 a certain United States Navy vessel arrived at Townsville and Labanon retrieved from it a quantity of amphetamine and handed it to Maio. Maio and Mohammadi were arrested in possession of it. The weight was 11 kilograms, 7.3 kilograms pure. On the same day the applicant and Dunn spoke on the telephone about a ship coming in. However, it was not asserted that the applicant was involved in the importation. 
     
      
    7 On 9 November 2005 Joy arrived in Sydney from overseas and on 13 November Cooper also arrived from overseas. The applicant later met Joy and Cooper. Joy left Australia on 12 December. On 27 December the applicant travelled by car from Sydney to the Gold Coast and collected from Cooper $100,000 in cash. She drove back to Sydney and delivered the money to a cash dealer. On 30 December Cooper left Australia.  
     
      
    8 In March 2006 Joy returned to Australia. He told the applicant that he was sick and needed help. She visited him at his hotel. Joy had $100,000 in cash. The applicant helped him to count it. Joy left the applicant’s presence and delivered the money to someone else. It was not suggested that the applicant was involved in dealing with that money. 
     
      
    9 Cooper arrived in Australia. On 18 March 2006 the applicant travelled once again by car to the Gold Coast. She collected a further sum of $100,000 in cash from Cooper. She brought it back to Sydney by car. Joy was away from Sydney at the time and the applicant stored it in a cupboard for a couple of days before meeting up with Joy and giving it all to him. Not long afterwards Joy left Australia once again.  
     
      
    10 Early in May Mohammadi, Labanon and Maio appeared in the Supreme Court of Queensland charged with drug offences. Maio pleaded guilty and the other two were convicted of offences concerning the importation. On 12 May the applicant told Joy about the verdicts. On 15 May the applicant spoke to Cooper and on 17 May flew to the Gold Coast and met him. On the following day the applicant and Dunn discussed the sentence just passed on Mohammadi. Cooper had about $50,000 in cash. He and the applicant counted it. The applicant took it and brought it back to Sydney by plane. On 21 May the applicant spoke to Dunn on the telephone, mentioning that she hoped that there were no more buggings and that she had to prepare herself for a knock at the door. On 31 May the applicant delivered the sum of $49,950 in cash to a currency dealer in Ryde.  
     
      
    11 On 24 October 2006 the applicant was arrested. She was interviewed by federal agents on that day and again on 21 November 2006. On 24 October 2006 the applicant said that she had carried money only once, $50,000, which she had taken to a brokerage place. She did not know where it had come from. She assumed that it was for Mohammadi’s legal costs. 
     
      
    12 On 21 November 2006 she admitted transporting cash on the three occasions I have set out. Explaining the carriage of money in December 2005, she said that she believed that the money she was collecting was for legal fees for Mohammadi. She assumed that it had come from the account of a brother of Mohammadi. It never crossed her mind to ask why Cooper, who was already on the Gold Coast, could not simply have paid the lawyers himself. She was chronically depressed and was being treated and was prepared to do any little task that made her feel worthy. She was happy to help her friend and did not question what she was asked to do because it gave her some motivation to get out of bed. She said that she was not suspicious about the money.  
     
      
    13 A substantial subjective case was put to the sentencing judge. His Honour summarised it thus - 
     
      
       
        
        The offender is thirty-three years old and was born in South Africa. Her parents separated when she was about four years of age. Later she went to a boarding school. She was sexually molested at the age of twelve and then she moved to Australia. At sixteen she was sexually assaulted by her then boyfriend. 
        
       
       
        
        In 1990 she returned to South Africa and undertook various ballet, drama and music courses. In 1997 to 2001, she lived in Japan where she worked as a singer. She continued to work as a singer in Australia as well. In early 2005, her band broke up and this distressed her and she found it difficult to find work as a singer. 
         
         
        She started seeing a psychiatrist, Dr Freed around this time who prescribed a medication regime. He considered that she suffered from “a mixed polar” disorder with symptoms of depression and hypomania. Dr Freed noted that the offender was responding to his treatment and medication as he continued to review her throughout 2006. Dr Freed saw Ms Du Randt again on 8 December 2006 noting that she had been arrested by the police on 24 October 2006 and charged with eight counts of money laundering. She informed Dr Freed that she had helped friends and that she believed the monies were needed for a friend and she thought that she had been wrongfully arrested. Dr Freed noted the normal previous sessions. Ms Du Randt had not given any indication that she was involved in any illegal activity. Dr Freed also noted that the offender had been taking a number of medications and also had taken a drug known as base which is an amphetamine. 
         
         
        The offender saw a psychiatrist, Dr John Roberts on 1 December 2006, the report dated 15 January 2007 who diagnosed a bipolar mood disorder. As to the offender’s drug use, Dr Roberts said at p8 of his report: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘As far as substance abuse is concerned, use of a substance in a person predisposed by family history and is as the case here, to the disturbances of mood, would be likely to endanger in them mood fluctuation to a greater degree and severity than would be the case if such a predisposition to mood disturbance did not exist. If a presumption is made of a mood disorder being present, the use of substances would compound mood fluctuation and exacerbate the underlying condition and compounding the tendency of that condition to procure ill considered acts arising as a result of poor judgment’. 
          
         
        
       
      
    14 The applicant’s mother gave evidence which impressed his Honour. She said that the applicant had withdrawn from the family and that she, her mother, had no idea about her mental health. She said that the applicant was living with her and could continue to do so. She was confident that the applicant would continue her treatment. 
     
      
    15 His Honour observed that the applicant had not given evidence but referred to a passage in the pre-sentence report, prepared by a Probation and Parole officer, to the effect that the applicant felt highly embarrassed that she did not understand that she was taking part in money laundering. She expressed her regret, having contributed to an illegal activity. She explained that her actions were based upon her having trusted associates that she knew in common with a close friend and had relied on their advice that the activity was legal.  
     
      
    16 His Honour noted the early plea of guilty as well as her agreement, reported through her solicitor, to co-operate with the police should others be charged in relation to the offences under consideration. 
     
      
    17 His Honour reviewed the medical, particularly the psychiatric, evidence and noted that the applicant was under treatment at the time that she committed the offence. His Honour accepted that there were mental problems which were unresolved and that they moderated, if only to a limited extent, the need for general deterrence. 
     
      
    18 His Honour noted that the applicant had no prior criminal history.  
     
      
    19 His Honour noted the submission of the applicant’s solicitor, based on the diagnosis of her treating psychiatrist, Dr Freed, that the applicant had a significant degree of impairment of her psychological functioning and control. His Honour did not accept that submission. 
     
      
    20 His Honour expressed himself dissatisfied that the mental condition from which the applicant was suffering had interfered with what she was doing when she carried the money.  
     
      
    21 His Honour declined an invitation not to impose a period of imprisonment but to make a psychiatric probation order under the provisions of s20BV Crimes Act 1914 (Commonwealth). 
     
      
    22 The grounds of appeal other than the sixth, which was not pressed, are as follows – 1. The sentences imposed by the learned sentencing judge was too severe having regard to the objective and subjective circumstances of the offence. 
     
      
    2. The sentencing judge erred in finding that the applicant’s offending was objectively very serious and must be met with condign punishment. 
     
      
    3. The sentencing judge erred in finding that the applicant’s mental condition from which she suffered did not interfere with what she was doing when she carried the cash. 
     
      
    4. The sentencing judge erred in finding that at the time of the offence and now, mental issues remain unresolved which moderated, if only to a limited extent the need for general deterrence. 
     
      
    5. The learned sentencing judge erred in rejecting the opinion of Dr Freed that the applicant had a “significant degree of impairment of her psychological and functioning and control”. 
     
      
       
        
         
         7. By reason of the applicant’s psychiatric/medical  
          
          condition subsequent to the imposition of sentence a miscarriage of justice has occurred (such that a different and lesser sentence should now be imposed upon the applicant). 
          
         
        
       
      
    23 Only grounds 1 and 7 were argued with any vigour. Mr Walsh, who appeared for the applicant, accepted that grounds 2, 3,4 and 5 did no more than particularise a number of errors contended for. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1. The sentence imposed by the learned sentencing judge was too severe having regard to the objective and subjective circumstances of the offence. 
       
      
    24 Two substantial arguments were put forward under this ground. The first was that his Honour did not consider whether and how the applicant’s mental condition affected her appreciation of the gravity of the offence, as it was put, “whether she understood the gravity of the wrongdoing”. Mr Walsh referred the Court to a number of cases which explained the various ways in which the mental illness of an offender may sound in the sentence to be imposed. In Leach v R [2008] NSWCCA 73 Basten JA at [10] – [12] set forth with approval the principles explained by the members of the Court of Appeal of Victoria in R v Verdins [2007] VSCA 102 at [32] thus - 
     
      
    1. The condition may reduce the moral culpability of the offending conduct, as distinct from the offender’s legal responsibility. Where that is so, the condition affects the punishment that is just in all the circumstances; and denunciation is less likely to be a relevant sentencing objective.2. The condition may have a bearing on the kind of sentence that is imposed and the conditions in which it should be served.3. Whether general deterrence should be moderated or eliminated as a sentencing consideration depends upon the nature and severity of the symptoms exhibited by the offender, and the effect of the condition on the mental capacity of the offender, whether at the time of the offending or at the date of sentence or both.4. Whether specific deterrence should be moderated or eliminated as a sentencing consideration likewise depends upon the nature and severity of the symptoms of the condition as exhibited by the offender, and the effect of the condition on the mental capacity of the offender, whether at the time of the offending or at the date of the sentence or both.5. The existence of the condition at the date of sentencing (or its foreseeable recurrence) may mean that a given sentence will weigh more heavily on the offender than it would on a person in normal health.6. Where there is a serious risk of imprisonment having a significant adverse effect on the offender’s mental health, this will be a factor tending to mitigate punishment. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    25 For these submissions Mr Walsh relied on what was said in R v Verdins at paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4. 
     
      
    26 Reference was made to the judgment in this court in R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255 in which the Chief Justice, with whom Simpson J and Blanch AJ agreed, said at [21] – [25] - 
     
      
       
        
        21 The significance of mental illness of an offender in the sentencing exercised has long been accepted. The relevant authorities have been reviewed in this Court, the Victorian Court of Appeal and the Western Australian Full Court. See  
        R v Fahda 
         [1999] NSWCCA 267 at [40]-[48] per Simpson J;  
        R v Harb 
         [2001] NSWCCA 249 at [35]-[45] per Smart AJ; see also  
        R v Lauritsen 
         (2000) 114 A Crim R 333, esp [43]-[51] per Malcolm CJ;  
        R v Tsiaras 
         [1996] 1 VR 398 at 400; see also Potas, Sentencing Manual: Law Principles and Practice in New South Wales 2001 at 285-286; Fox and Freiberg, Sentencing State and Federal Law in Victoria (2nd ed), 1999 at 293-294.  
         
         
        22 In the present case, the Crown was prepared to concede that some mitigation was appropriate, on the basis of giving less weight to the issue of general deterrence. However, that is not the only way in which mental illness impinges on the exercise of the sentencing discretion.  
         
         
        23 To the extent that mental illness explains the offence – as her Honour found to be the position in the present case – then an offender’s inability to understand the wrongfulness of his actions, or to make reasonable judgments, or to control his or her faculties and emotions, will impact on the level of culpability of the offender, even where the illness does not amount to an excuse at law. As Wood CJ at CL put it in  
        Henry 
        , supra, at [254]:  
         
         
          
          “… the community will readily understand that the offender who suffers from a mental disorder or abnormality is less in control of his or her cognitive facilities or emotional restraints, and in some instances lacks the ability to make reasoned or ordered judgments. Almost invariably there is a limited appreciation of the wrongfulness of the act, or of its moral culpability, which although falling short of avoiding criminal responsibility does justify special consideration upon sentencing.” 
          
         
         
        24 I agree with the observations of Malcolm CJ in  
        Lauritsen 
         at [48]:  
         
          
           
          “… mental illness is not only relevant to assessing culpability, in which case it must be shown to have contributed to the offence, but it is also relevant to assessing the level of danger the offender presents and the appropriate way in which the offender is to be rehabilitated. The mental illness should be taken into account in sentencing whether or not it played a part in the commission of the offence, but not with the consequence of the imposition of a sentence which exceeds the seriousness of the offence.” 
          
         
         
        25 Furthermore, mental illness may also lead to the conclusion in a particular case that the element of personal deterrence, not just general deterrence, is also entitled to less weight in the sentencing exercise than it may otherwise have because, as the Victorian Court of Appeal put it:  
         
          
           
          “… specific deterrence may be more difficult to achieve and is often not worth pursuing as such.” (Tsiaras, supra, at 400) 
          
         
        
       
      
    27 Mr Walsh drew the court’s attention to parts of the report of Dr Freed, which was before the sentencing judge. The first was bipolar disorder mixed with psychotic features. She had manic-like symptoms since at least 1999 and significant depressive symptomatology following her sister’s rape and assault in September 2005. She had the complication of mixed intertwining between depressed and manic phases as well as psychotic features, namely auditory hallucinations and paranoid ideation. She thought that flies settled on her because she was garbage. She thought that her family whispered about her. Dr Freed drew attention to the family history of mental illness, including bipolar disorder. 
     
      
    28 The second condition was post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from a number of incidents in the family when she was very young, including cruelty at the hands of a step-mother, molestation by a stranger at the age of six, beatings at boarding school, molestation by a neighbour at the age of 12, rape at the age of 16, mental abuse by a friend at the age of 18 and the deaths of a number of people close to her, including members of her family. It was the assault and rape of her sister by four men in 2005 which resulted in her referral to Dr Freed for treatment.  
     
      
    29 Dr Freed said that the applicant had associated with these conditions bizarre psychotic dreams which reflected abandonment and neglect in the past. There were dreams of abortion and of eating human internal organs.  
     
      
    30 Dr Freed diagnosed borderline personality disorder, characterised by an identity crisis. She consulted people who inflicted pain upon her. She abused drugs. She had symptoms of efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment, impulsivity in drug and alcohol abuse and body piercing, suicidal thoughts, a marked reactivity of mood, feelings of emptiness, inappropriate anger and severe dissociative symptoms.  
     
      
    31 Dr Freed also noted the applicant’s periodic drug and alcohol abuse. He concluded as follows - 
     
      
       
        
        In this morass of multiple pathologies with significant mood changes, both in the depressed and elated phases, hallucinatory voices, and thought disorder (with an impaired capacity to test the logic of situations), she has had a significant loss of insight and judgment. Her disabilities arise out of mental illness of which the core element is Bipolar Disorder with psychosis, and the secondary elements being Post Traumatic Stress Disorder from multiple traumas, Borderline Personality Disorder, and Periodic Drug and Alcohol Abuse.  
        
       
      
    32 Dr Freed gave evidence before the sentencing judge. In order to illustrate the applicant’s likely lack of judgmental ability he gave a hypothesis of a person to whom a stranger offers a Rolex watch for fifty dollars. Whereas most people would conclude either that the watch was not a genuine Rolex or that, if it was, it had been stolen, the applicant might have jumped to the conclusion that the stranger and the watch were genuine and the transaction “pleasing”. 
     
      
    33 In his report Dr Roberts noted Dr Freed’s diagnosis and continued - 
     
      
       
        
        If a presumption is made of a mood disorder being present, the use of substances would compound mood fluctuations and exacerbate the underlying condition compounding tendency of that condition to produce ill considered acts, arising as a result of poor judgment. 
        
       
       
        
        In relation to the charges for which Ms Du Randt is facing Court, assuming her statements to me are true and accurate, namely that she believed that the monies handled by her were monies that were in essence legitimate and designed for the payment of legal expenses, and which she stated had been told to her, as being money emanating from Iran and because of this monies origin had to be dealt with in this manner, would be explanations that would be on grounds of probability more readily accepted by a person with a diagnosed mental illness, than a person in full possession of their critical faculties. 
        
       
      
    34 Mr Walsh drew the attention of the Court to passages in the remarks on sentence. Having referred to the Crown and defence cases on the need for adequate punishment, objective seriousness, general and subjective or personal deterrence, including the evidence of the mental health of the applicant, his Honour continued -  
     
      
       
        
        …I have carefully read all the reports and listened to the evidence of Dr Freed. I am not convinced on reading the agreed facts, including the telephone taps that the mental condition from which the offender suffered interfered with what she was doing when she carried the cash. 
        
       
       
        
        She was under treatment during the time she committed the offences and according to Dr Freed, responded positively to that treatment. However, I do accept that she had, at the time of the offence and now, mental issues unresolved which moderates, if only to a limited extent, the need for general deterrence in offences such as this. 
        
       
      
    35 It was submitted on appeal that his Honour failed to take into account the inability of the applicant truly to understand the nature of what she was doing as affecting the need for general and personal deterrence. 
     
      
    36 The case for the Crown and for the defence was put before his Honour at great length and in great detail. The Statement of Facts ran for 27 pages and the two records of interview for 19 and 47 pages respectively. Dr Freed’s monumental statement ran for 38 pages. Dr Roberts’ was more concise at nine pages. The Crown’s written submissions on sentence ran for 22 pages and the supplementary submissions for three pages. The defence written submissions on sentence ran for 27 pages. His Honour is a busy sentencing judge and I suspect that the perceived need to husband resources led him to deal more succinctly with the subject matter than did the parties. 37 I have extracted his Honour’s resume of the evidence relied on and the conclusion to which his Honour came. Having read the reports of Dr Freed and Dr Roberts and having heard the evidence of Dr Freed, his Honour could scarcely have failed to understand that it was an important part of the defence case that the mental condition from which she was suffering robbed the applicant of the ability fully to appreciate the nature of what she was doing. I would not take his Honour’s not mentioning in terms the evidence relied on or the submissions made in reliance on it as leading to the conclusion that his Honour failed to consider that submission or that evidence. In imposing sentence his Honour did make a modest allowance for the mental condition of the applicant, and I think that must have been on account of the arguments then and now put. I do not think that his Honour failed to appreciate the case that was being put or failed to consider the submissions made on this topic.38 The second substantial argument put forward under this ground was that his Honour failed to consider the effect on the service of her sentence of the applicant’s state of health. Mr Walsh relied on the fifth and sixth principles referred to in Vergins. See also the judgment of Spigelman CJ in R v Israil at [26]. 
     
      
    39 A substantial case for an amelioration of the sentence on this basis was put before the sentencing judge, relying, inter alia, upon a submission that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on a mentally ill person and that may be a material consideration in determining the length of the sentence to be served. 
     
      
    40 In the remarks on sentence his Honour made a number of references to the significance for the sentence of the applicant’s mental illness. Having reviewed the evidence about mental illness his Honour went on to consider the matters to which, by s16A Crimes Act, the Court should have regard. Subs (2)(k) introduces the need to ensure that the person is adequately punished for the offence. It was expressly in relation to that paragraph that his Honour rehearsed the submissions about the applicant’s mental illness and expressed the conclusion which I have set out above. 
     
      
    41 Para (m) of the same subsection introduces the need to have regard to the character, antecedents, cultural background, age, means and physical or mental condition of the person to be sentenced. His Honour’s remarks make no reference to that paragraph. 
     
      
    42 His Honour came back to consider the evidence of Dr Freed a second time, but only in the context of s17A(1), which provides that a court shall not pass a sentence of imprisonment unless, having considered all other available sentences, it is satisfied that no other sentence is appropriate in all the circumstances. It was there that his Honour considered the recommendation of Dr Freed that the applicant be not sentenced to imprisonment at all, but have the benefit of a psychiatric probation order. That was a recommendation and a submission that his Honour rejected, as I think he was entitled to do, but it does illustrate the limited context in which his Honour took into account the mental illness of the applicant. 
     
      
    43 Notwithstanding that a few sentences later his Honour said this - 
     
      
       
        
        In imposing a sentence, I have to take into account all relevant factors under s16A. I have carefully weighed up the subjective factors in the offenders favour and including her mental health. 
        
       
       
      I think that his Honour overlooked consideration of the question whether the applicant’s sentence should be ameliorated because it would be more onerous upon her because of her mental condition. If his Honour had taken that factor into account I would have expected some reference, however brief, to have been made to the distinctly different manner in which the mental illness of the applicant might affect the sentence. 
       
      
    44 In my opinion this second attack on the sentence has been made good. In my opinion the several conditions from which the applicant was suffering at the time of sentence were such as to entitle her to consideration and amelioration of her sentence. 
     
      
    45 Under the seventh ground of appeal Mr Walsh put forward further medical evidence of the medical condition of the applicant. There was some debate as to the basis upon which the Court ought to receive the material. However, I would receive the material for the purpose of re-sentencing, as the Court ordinarily does.  
     
      
    46 Since the commencement of her sentence the applicant has been seen frequently by professionals, weekly by a psychologist and monthly by a psychiatrist. She has been treated and medicine has been prescribed and the psychologist has given her helpful advice. Notwithstanding these matters, Mrs Prinsloo, the applicant’s mother, reported that the applicant had put on weight and particularly that her lower legs were swollen and blotchy. 
     
      
    47 Dr Roberts was called to see the applicant on 2 December 2007 and wrote a report on 11 December 2007. He confirmed the matters complained of by Mrs Prinsloo and confirmed that because of the change in the applicant’s appearance consequent upon her gain of very substantial weight he failed at first to recognise her. He described the condition of the lower legs as pitting oedema. He considered that this condition to be a side effect of the drugs that the applicant was taking. Dr Roberts confirmed a diagnosis of bipolar disorder with psychotic features and commented that her condition was complex and because of drug sensitivity treatment was difficult. Treatment had produced significant side effects which were severe, but not of the most severe degree. Doctor Roberts wondered whether the applicant could be adequately treated in custody, not because of any asserted lack or skill of those having the care of her but because of a lack of resources, psychiatrists within the Prison Psychiatric Service being able to see inmates less frequently than would be the case in a private psychiatric clinic. 
     
      
    48 Dr Roberts saw the applicant again on 24 March 2008 and wrote a report dated the following day. He confirmed that the applicant presented features of depression with psychosis and had a history of symptomatology suggesting bipolar disorder. She presented in a manner suggestive of significant deterioration, marked by persistent psychosis, flat, unresponsive affect and depressed mood. He thought that her physical health had deteriorated markedly. She was morbidly obese and had pitting oedema up to the knees of unknown origin. There were certain symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease. He continued -  
     
      
       
        
        It is my view on psychiatric grounds that because of Ms Du Randt’s pre-incarceration history of unwellness that the imprisonment is disproportionately severe for her to tolerate and constitutes to her a level of punishment which by virtue of the psychiatric condition present is a level of punishment which by virtue of the psychiatric condition present is a level of punishment that is far more difficult for her to tolerate than would be the case if she was not mentally ill. 
        
       
      
    49 Dr Roberts considered that urgent measures were needed to control weight gain and to clarify the causation of oedema, nocturia and breathlessness on exertion. Again he suggested that it would be less difficult for appropriate investigations and more intensive management to be undertaken outside the prison system.  
     
      
    50 The Crown responded by having the applicant see Dr Allnutt, psychiatrist, who saw her on 31 March and 28 April 2008. Dr Allnutt expressed the opinion in a report on 7 April 2008 that the applicant had bipolar affective disorder with episodes of psychosis. Her predominant mood state was depressor though she had brief periods of hypomania and mania. On occasions she had experienced auditory hallucinations, possibly persecutory delusions and disturbance of thought processes in the form of thought disorder or a flight of ideas. Dr Allnutt, too, considered that the applicant’s illness was complicated by difficulties in maintaining her medication due to side effects. He thought, however, that she had improved during the last two months with changes in medication. He thought that she appeared to be coping with the prison environment. He noted that she was continuing to receive psychiatric treatment.  
     
      
    51 Dr Allnutt expressed the opinion that the treatment being offered was appropriate. He thought that there had been fluctuation in her mood since her incarceration, with a depressive episode with psychotic features. However, she had responded to some degree to the medication. He thought that she remained at risk of deterioration in her mental state due to further difficulties in her treatment or to the natural fluctuations of her mental illness. For that reason she would require ongoing psychiatric monitoring with access to medical intervention when required.  
     
      
    52 Dr Allnutt had been asked to comment upon the suggestion that the applicant’s condition might not be able to be adequately managed in custody. He said that while prisons are not ideal places to treat mental illness, inmates with severe mental illness, such as the one suffered by the applicant, had access to Long Bay Hospital and, for women, to B Ward East at Long Bay Hospital. He went on to describe the staffing of those facilities and concluded that overall that he did not believe that the applicant’s case was of a nature or severity that deviated significantly from the kinds of illnesses and medical difficulties that many inmates had within the prison system. He believed that her psychiatric condition could be adequately managed in custody. If her condition became unmanageable transfer to a civil psychiatric or medical hospital could be arranged under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 2007.  
     
      
    53 Dr Allnutt provided a further report on 28 April 2008. He noted reports of the applicant’s recent history and complaints including depression, oedema, amenorrhoea and discussed the variations in the drugs which were being prescribed for her. Dr Allnutt noted that on 28 March 2008 there was a significant improvement in the mood, that she was less sedated since a change of drugs and that there was an improvement in her physical condition. She described hearing voices she said sounded like her mother’s but she was aware they were own thoughts. There were no command hallucinations or delusions.  
     
      
    54 Dr Allnutt saw no reason to alter the opinion expressed in his earlier report. He thought that the notes reflected a recent improvement following changes in her medication. He observed that she remained vulnerable to further fluctuations in her mental state.  
     
      
    55 In my opinion the evidence shows that the effect on the applicant of the various illnesses from which she suffers will be significant as she serves her sentence, and on that account her sentence ought to be mitigated. Accordingly, I have come to the view that a lesser sentence than that imposed by his Honour is warranted: s6 (3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
    56 Because of the conclusion I have reached, it is unnecessary to consider grounds 2,3,4 or 5. 
     
      
    57 I note the large amount of money – just short of $250,000 – with which the applicant was concerned and the considerable period of time over which the three incidents comprising the offence took place. I note that the role of the applicant was that of a courier and not of someone with a greater control and a more intimate knowledge of what was happening. I note that the mental illness from which the applicant was suffering at the time of the offence had some effect upon her ability fully to appreciate what she was being asked to do, though that effect was not great, especially in view of the fact that she was being treated at the time. I also note the content of the things that she said to Dunn on the telephone, which showed that she knew that she was doing wrong, though she may not have known exactly how, and throws doubt upon her later protestation of having been wrongly charged. I note the early plea of guilty and the prior good character of the applicant. I note some evidence of contrition. 
     
      
    58 I propose that the applicant be granted leave to appeal, that the sentence appealed from be quashed and that there be substituted a sentence of imprisonment of two years and six months. The sentence is to be taken to have commenced on 28 September 2007 and will expire on 27 March 2010. I would direct that the applicant be released on 27 March 2009 on a Recognisance Release Order self in the sum of $100.

      2007/862 REGINA v RYAN BARRY BURNES 
       
       
       
      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
       
      HER HONOUR: 
       
      
    1 On 3 April 2007 the offender, Ryan Barry Burnes, pleaded guilty in the Local Court to the murder of Andrew John Heavens (the deceased). The offence was committed at about 10.15 pm on 2 May 2003 within the grounds at Callan Park at Rozelle. The maximum penalty for this offence is life imprisonment. 
     
      
    2 The sentence proceedings commenced before me on 8 June 2007 and were adjourned to 14 June for submissions. 
     
      
    3 The evidence tendered by the Crown on sentence consisted of an Agreed Statement of Facts and the offender’s criminal history, together with various materials from the Crown brief of evidence including several witness statements, photographs from the crime scene, a listening device transcript and two ERISP transcripts (each of which extended over many hours), a ballistics report and a Report of Death to Coroner. 
     
      
    4 The Crown also called evidence from Detective Senior Constable Glen Morfoot. His evidence was principally directed to detailing the course of the police investigation into the murder of the deceased - an investigation that commenced with the finding of the body in May 2003, and, as the investigation progressed, also involved an investigation into a drug supply business in which the deceased was involved at the time of his death. The investigation was ongoing from May 2003 but did not result in any arrests until 16 August 2006 when this offender was arrested and charged with murder after making full admissions to police in a record of interview conducted that day. On 20 September 2006 the co offender Scott Alan May was arrested and also charged with the deceased’s murder.  
     
      
    5 The evidence from Detective Senior Constable Glen Morfoot enabled me to have an appreciation of the extent to which the Crown relies upon the evidence of this offender in the case it brings against May. I am satisfied that without the evidence of this offender, the Crown case against May would be significantly weakened to the extent that he would be unlikely to be committed for trial. I am fortified in this view because, notwithstanding the fact that police had reason to suspect that May was implicated in the murder, there was insufficient evidence to support a charge until this offender nominated May as the person who solicited him to kill the deceased.  
     
      
    6 The offender has signed an undertaking dated 8 June 2007 to give evidence against May in accordance with three statements he has given to police following his arrest. In his evidence, the offender expressly disavowed a further account he gave to police in an induced statement in January this year where he claimed that he shot the deceased in self-defence and that May had not asked him to kill but had merely given him the gun in the event that it might be needed if the deceased could not be persuaded to co-operate with May’s plans for the drug business. In the course of his evidence before me, the offender confirmed his willingness to give evidence for the Crown in both the pending committal proceedings against May and any subsequent trial, including any appeal and retrial. I will return to consider the extent to which this past assistance, and the offer of future assistance, discounts the sentence that would otherwise be imposed on this offender for murder later in this judgment. 
     
      
       
      The finding of the body 
       
      
    7 The body of the deceased was located in Callan Park, Rozelle at about 7:15 am on 3 May 2003 by a passer-by. He was found lying on his back in open grasslands about 200 metres west of the Balmain Road entrance to Callan Park. Police received a 000 call on 2 May 2003 from a person living close by who reported hearing first a single gun shot and then two gunshots in quick succession at about 10.15pm. 
     
      
    8 There were three bullet holes in the deceased’s upper torso. An unspecified amount of cash and two M&M packets, each containing a number of balloons of heroin, were located on the body. The deceased was wearing a black money belt around his waist underneath his clothing. There was no money inside the belt. The photographs reveal that the deceased was shot while smoking a cigarette as the burnt remains of the cigarette are visible between the fingers of his hand. 
     
      
    9 Three fired cartridge casings from a .45 calibre weapon were found in close proximity to the body together with one projectile. Further examination of the crime scene revealed two projectiles buried in the ground beneath the body. This evidence established that the deceased was murdered where he was found, and that he was shot once in the upper chest area causing him to fall to the ground and then shot twice in the chest area while he was lying on the ground. 
     
      
    10 The offender’s account to police as to the weapon he used and the execution style killing he employed is consistent with the witness who placed the call to 000 after hearing three gunshots and with the forensic and ballistic evidence. In addition, the information volunteered by the offender when he was interviewed by police in August 2006 in describing the gun he used adds objective weight to the reliability of his account since it was not public knowledge that the weapon used to kill the deceased was a .45 calibre weapon.  
     
      
    11 On 4 May 2003, a post-mortem examination conducted by Forensic pathologist, Dr Paul Botterill, determined that the cause of death was the direct result of three gun shot wounds to the upper chest. While no other cause of death was identified, a toxicology and serology report submitted as part of the Report to the Coroner confirmed the presence of morphine in significant quantities in the blood and bile of the deceased together with methadone and cannabis. 
     
      
    The business of supplying heroin  
     
      
    12 In the course of the investigation the de facto partner of the deceased informed police that at the time of his death in May 2003, and for some time before that date, the deceased was involved in the supply of heroin in the inner city area of Sydney. Other evidence indicated he was a heroin-user. She told police about the established arrangements in place between the deceased and May in the operation of their drug business.  
     
      
    13 There is no evidence that this offender had any financial stake in that business. While there is evidence that he was a drug user, and that he and May had used drugs together since they were boys, there is no evidence that he was supplied drugs by May at any time relative to the murder or by the deceased at any time. I am satisfied however, that even though the offender had not met the deceased before the night he killed him, he was aware that May was in the business of drug supply and that the deceased and May were involved together in that enterprise.  
     
      
    14 The established arrangements between the deceased and May for the distribution of heroin at the time of his murder were that the deceased would purchase heroin in wholesale amounts of an ounce from May and provide May with payment of $8000 per ounce ‘up-front’. The deceased would then mix the heroin purchased from May with a cutting agent, package it into capsules or balloons and deliver these amounts to two runners who worked for him. The runners would then distribute the heroin to customers on the street or elsewhere. The deceased provided the runners with two mobile telephones. The various SIM cards used in the mobile telephones by the runners contained the telephone numbers of the customers. This enabled the runners to contact the customers or the customers to contact the runners. The runners would then either deliver the heroin or the customers would collect it at a designated collection point. After the heroin had been distributed the runners would account back to the deceased and he would recover the telephones and SIM cards. 15 The deceased’s de facto partner also told police that around April 2003, May was finding it difficult to obtain heroin from his suppliers, and that this drug shortage continued for about three weeks. It is not clear whether the deceased obtained heroin from another source in the interim. She also told police that the deceased had told her that he had been fighting with May at about this time about the SIM cards that were being used to establish communication links with customers. May apparently claimed that the SIM cards belonged to him because he had given the deceased a “start” in the business. After several heated exchanges, May apparently offered a compromise which involved the two men splitting the various SIM cards with May being given sole access to one of the deceased’s runners. She understood that the deceased rejected that compromise. The deceased was reportedly of the opinion that May was beginning to realise that he could be cut out of the business altogether given that the deceased had the SIM cards and the runners working for him and needed only to purchase his own wholesale quantities of the drug before being a principal in his own right. 
     
      
    16 One of the deceased’s runners, a person known only as N, gave a statement to police to the effect that approximately one and a half weeks prior to his death, the deceased was seen with May and another man named Sean Rafferty. N also told police that about a week prior to the shooting he was approached by Rafferty who offered him the opportunity to distribute heroin for an increased wage which he accepted. 
     
      
    17 N told police that on 1 May 2003, he met with Rafferty and was given a new telephone as a means of contacting customers. He was told that the drug supply business was to be conducted in the same way the deceased had conducted it, that is, with the runner returning the mobile telephone to Rafferty at the end of the day. He was due to commence work for Rafferty on 2 May 2003. On that day, N also met with the deceased and was given two mobile telephones and two M&M containers containing heroin valued at $4000. He said he told the deceased that it would be his last day working for him. N also informed police that whilst he was distributing heroin for the deceased that day he handed out pieces of paper to the deceased’s customers with the new telephone number provided to him by Rafferty. 
     
      
    18 The deceased’s de-facto partner last saw the deceased at about 4 pm on 2 May 2003. She observed him to carry a large amount of money in a black money belt, a mobile telephone, and a Nintendo Game Boy Advance. She understood he was to meet with May later that day.  
     
      
    19 Telephone records indicate that there was telephone contact between Rafferty and May at 7:26 pm (and also later that night around 9 pm) and between the deceased and May at 7:41 pm. At about 8 pm the deceased called his de-facto and informed her that he was on his way to the Union Hotel, Newtown, and would be home late as May could not meet him for a couple of hours. Between 8:30 pm and 9 pm one of the deceased’s customers spoke to him on the telephone to try to arrange to meet with him. During the course of this conversation the deceased stated that he was going to Newtown and that he had to meet his “boss” at some stage of the night. 
     
      
    20 Telephone records also indicate that at 9:04 pm on 2 May 2003 the deceased made a telephone call to May. At this time the deceased’s call signal was recorded by telephone towers at Newtown and at Petersham – consistent with him moving towards the Leichhardt/Rozelle area - while May’s phone was being used in the Balmain area. At 9.45 pm telephone records show a call placed by the deceased to May, this time with the tower at Leichhardt recording the call. This was the last call placed or received by the deceased. 
     
      
       
      Evidence leading to the prisoner being charged with the deceased’s murder 
       
      
    21 On 16 August 2006, over three years after the murder, and in the course of a lengthy interview extending over many hours, the offender admitted to police that he shot the deceased three times in the upper body in the grounds of Callan Park. He said that two days before the shooting he was asked by May whether he would be prepared to kill someone who was presenting May with problems. He agreed he would. He said he was collected from his home in Waterloo by May at about 9 pm on the night of the murder and, after May picked up the deceased outside Market Town at Leichhardt, the three men drove to Callan Park. En route to Leichhardt the offender was given the gun by May which he placed in his pants.  
     
      
    22 It was agreed between May and the offender at that time that if May said “I am going to the car to get my wallet”, the offender was to draw the gun and shoot to kill. He didn’t speak to the deceased in the car although he was casually introduced to him. After parking the car the deceased and May walked ahead of him into the park. He said that at first May and the deceased appeared to be talking without rancour but that as they walked deeper into the park their voices became raised. He said that he was not listening to what was being said but rather was waiting to see whether May would give the pre-arranged signal. When May announced that he was going to the car to get his wallet, and walked off towards the car ostensibly to get it, the offender recalls that the deceased lit a cigarette and engaged in small talk with him. Within minutes he drew the gun and shot the deceased at point blank range. It is not clear where May was at the time the shots were fired but he did say to the offender, once he was in the car, “you done well … I knew you’d do it…..”. 
     
      
    23 May and the offender left the scene in May’s car taking the deceased’s scooter and the Game Boy that he was carrying when he was killed. This necessarily involved the offender riffling through the pockets of the deceased. He disposed of the scooter a day or so later, fearing that it may associate him with the murder. The Game Boy was pawned to buy drugs. 
     
      
    24 He told police that the events of the night were surreal in his memory and, that while he could recall the sequence of events from picking up the deceased at Market Town to shooting him in the grounds at Callan Park, he could not readily explain why he participated other than that he felt he had to follow through with what was expected of him. He said he felt like “it wasn’t really happening”. He told police that May didn’t tell him why he was being asked to kill the deceased and that he didn’t ask for an explanation. He said that while he took the $4000 May gave him, being half of what the deceased put in the glove box of the car before going into the park, he said he didn’t ask for any money and didn’t touch it for a week after the shooting. He said that from the time that the deceased was picked up by May and driven to Callan Park, to the time that he fired the three shots into the body of the deceased, everything happened very quickly. He admitted that he armed himself in the car before picking up the deceased and that when he took the gun from the front of his pants and fired it, he did so with the intention of shooting to kill. He said that he was in a disturbed state of mind. He said that he had been using a lot of cocaine at the time of the murder. He told police that he felt sick and that when he arrived home a short time later he locked himself in the bathroom for five hours. He said he knew he was “going straight to hell (because) once you do something like that there’s no comin’ back from it”. Further admissions were also made in written statements dated 16, 30 and 31 August 2006.  
     
      
    25 In January 2007, the offender participated in an induced record of interview in preparation for an induced statement. In the course of that interview he volunteered to police, for the first time, that he had been working for May in his drug business for some time leading up to the murder and thereafter, however he neither sold nor supplied heroin. His job was to watch Rafferty to ensure that he did not undercut May’s profit by either failing to account for all the heroin sold or by packaging it in such a way that he had more to sell than was agreed. It is not clear whether he was paid to do this. He also told police in the induced interview that he well knew that the deceased was one of May’s primary customers, having graduated from being a user to a successful supplier of heroin in a short time. 
     
      
       
      The offender’s motivation 
       
      
    26 While I accept the joint submission that the offender should be sentenced on the basis that he shot the deceased at the request of May, and that he used a gun that May supplied for that purpose, his motives for doing what was asked of him and his attitude to the shooting, both at the time and in the intervening years, has to be reviewed in the context of all the evidence that has been tendered on sentence. In each of four statements from an informant, in the covertly recorded conversations of the offender and that informant in February 2006, and even in the three statements and records of interview that the offender has since participated in with police, he has described his motivation for agreeing to do what May asked of him and his attitude to the killing in different ways. In some important respects these accounts are at variance with the approach that both the Crown and the offender invite me to adopt for sentencing purposes. Since the murder was on any view of the facts premeditated and executed by the offender on command, resolving questions such as whether the offender killed for a fee and the amount of money he was given or promised, or whether he was subject to the influence of drugs at the time of the killing or even whether he was later troubled by a guilty conscience may not, in the result, weigh very heavily in sentencing terms. That said, the discrepancies in his various accounts on these and other matters cannot simply be ignored. At the very least they may impact on an assessment of the level of objective criminality that attaches to his conduct and they may give some insight into whether the contrition he now expresses is genuine.  
     
      
    27 He was not taken in his evidence to the discrepancies in his accounts by either the Crown Prosecutor or his own counsel so as to enable me to assess the reliability and truthfulness of any explanation he may have been able to offer, and neither counsel addressed me on the way I should resolve these conflicts in the evidence. The discrepancies were, however, addressed at least in part in the records of interview with police in August 2006 and January 2007 and it is from this source only that I am left to reconcile the differences in his various accounts. This is not satisfactory. This Court has said on more than one occasion that if voluminous material is to be tendered on sentence in addition to an agreed statement of facts, it should generally accord with the agreed facts. If the tender of the material is to serve any other purpose, the sentencing judge should be told what the purpose of the tender is and be assisted with an explanation as to how the agreed facts and other evidential material might be reconciled if they are in conflict. It is not enough to tender the material and simply leave it to the sentencing judge to wade through it and to determine its relevance to the issues that arise on sentence. If the evidence is not to be read and used for sentencing purposes there is no proper basis for it to be tendered (see R v Barri [2004] NSWCCA 221 at [58] and R v Falls [2004] NSWCCA 335 at [29]). 
     
      
       
      Resolving the discrepancies in the offender’s accounts 
       
      
    28 Between March 2005 and February 2006 police were provided with information from an associate of the offender on an ongoing basis. This informant detailed many conversations where the offender is said to have both boasted of his of responsibility for ‘the Callan Park murder’ and complained about having been promised $40,000 by May for the killing which he did not ultimately receive. He also told the informant that he was offered the money to kill the deceased for his ‘drug run’. The informant and the offender were known to police to be regular drug users and for this reason, I can only assume, they approached the reliability of this information with some caution. On 12 February 2006, however, a conversation between the offender and the informant was recorded pursuant to a warrant issued under the Listening Devices Act 1984. With the active encouragement of the police this conversation took place in the grounds of Callan Park while the informant and the offender passed through the grounds to fish from a location near the Iron Cove Bridge. In this conversation the offender described in lurid terms how he shot the deceased, and, importantly, where in the park grounds the shooting took place. He also boasted of his bravado and the enjoyment he experienced when shooting to kill. What follows is an extract from that recording. It is representative of the offender’s attitude as reported by the informant over the preceding twelve months: 
     
      
       
        
        Track 11 
         
        Prisoner: Alan Heavens … (pause) … and there, that’s … first-walked …  
         
        Source: How the fuck did youse get him down here, what did he think was goin’ on, a deal, or something’? 
         
        Prisoner: Thought he was gonna, thought he was gonna buy … (pause) … You know what I’m spewing up about the most? He gave us the eight grand for the gear before we went for a walk… 
         
        Source: Did youse have him with ya? 
         
        Prisoner: Yeah. We picked him up from Market town and took him down … he knew somethin’ was goin’ on ‘cause he’s kept offerin’ me cigarette, bein’ nice to me and that… Scottie’s turned around, the signal was, um, ‘I’ve gotta go to get my wallet,’ alright, and that’s for ‘no,’ alright, if he said, but he didn’t say that, he started walking up the street, so that was the go… 
         
        … 
         
        Source: Yeah. 
         
        Prisoner: … I’m behind … I had the safety on … I pulled it up like that, clicked the safety off, he’s heard the click, he’s gone to turn around like that, ‘boom’ through here, he’s went down and he’s gasping, he’s trying to say somethin’ but I don’t remember what he said and then fucken I’ve just walked over the top of him and just fucken ‘boom,’ ‘boom.’  
        ( at this point the offender is said to have leaned froward and shaped his two fingers as if holding a gun ) 
         
         
        Source: So you put one in his nick and then two in his … 
         
        Prisoner: Two in his chest … that’s my style bro’, one in the head, two in the chest. I was trying to get him in the fucken head bro’, but as soon as he heard that safety click off … 
         
        Source: He’s turned, and you’ve missed and got his neck?

        Source: What the fuck was the cunt trying to say to ya? Like, you just put one in him, what the fuck can you say? 
         
        Prisoner: I think it was sort of like ‘why?’ Like ‘why?’ ‘why?’ … the voice, that’s what fucks me bro’. Just him and his eyes you know. 
         
        ... 
         
        Prisoner: Yeah I said ‘sorry,’ I said ‘sorry’ bro’, but ‘boom’ ‘boom.’

        Prisoner: I don’t care if they get me bro’. I don’t care, as long as I take out four or five of ‘em with me you know what I mean? 
         
        ... 
         
        You know that about me buzz, I, I, … I don’t care man. I love, I love it bro’. I do it bro’. I do. That’s … ‘cause I’m proud of it. Who else could do that shit and get away with it? 
         
        
       
      
    29 This segment and other segments of the recorded conversation with the informant were played to the offender in the record of interview with police upon his arrest in August 2006. It would appear that it was when he was confronted with the content of the recording that he resolved to make full admissions. Up until that point of time he was feigning a lack of memory of the incident without making any blanket denials of responsibility. Self evidently, were I persuaded that the attitude he displayed in the extract of the listening device was genuine, and that he stood to gain directly from the deceased’s death, even if he was unpaid in the result, the murder would be in the most objectively serious category. I am not satisfied that I can confidently come to that conclusion. I am conscious of the necessity for fairness to be the touchstone in the finding of facts for sentence and I am also conscious of the approach I must take in accordance with established authority in finding those facts (see R v O’ Neill [1979] 2 NSWLR 582 at 589). In my view there is no unfairness to the Crown in my acceptance of a view of the facts that are in the offender’s favour so far as his motivations and expressed attitude are concerned given the way that the Crown has approached the sentencing exercise. 
     
      
    30 In discharge of their duty of fairness to the offender the police gave him the opportunity to explain why he said these things to the informant. I have carefully read the explanation he gave to police in that interview, and the induced record of interview in January 2007. I am satisfied that the offender has endeavoured to truthfully account to police for what he said to the informant and that he was in fact under the influence of drugs at the time. I am of this view because, although the audio version of the listening device was not tendered, he pointed out to police how his locution when speaking to the informant showed his disordered thinking and the influence of the drugs he had taken. I am also satisfied, although not without some residue of doubt, that far from his bravado being genuine, it was likely to have been a mechanism he adopted in an effort to deal with his shame and his unresolved guilt in having murdered a person he didn’t know and for reasons he was never really clear about. He told police that after the murder he was left to deal with what he had done without any support from May, the person on whose behalf he had killed. He said that May refused to talk with him about it and progressively distanced himself from the offender in the weeks and months that followed. 
     
      
       
      The offender’s motive is explained in his relationship with May 
       
      
    31 I am prepared to proceed to sentence on the basis that the offender did not ask May for any explanation as to why it was necessary that the deceased be killed, or for that matter why it was necessary that he be the killer. That said, I am satisfied that since the offender well knew that May was in the business of the supply of heroin for on-supply to users of the drug, and that the deceased was one of his primary customers, that he was aware (even if was not spelled out for him) that the reason why May wanted the deceased killed was because of some actual or perceived threat he posed to May’s drug trafficking enterprise. It would also appear that the offender accepted without hesitation that May was justified (or must have been justified) in wanting the deceased killed and that he agreed, without hesitation, to play the role of the killer.  
     
      
    32 When pressed to explain why he accepted without question that the killing was justified, and accepted without hesitation the role he was to play, the offender explained that he acted out of loyalty to May who he regarded as a brother and a person who he described in evidence as his only real friend. The fact that he has resolved to give evidence against this man is an important factor to take into account when assessing the extent to which his sentence should be discounted for assistance. 
     
      
    33 In addition, I am also satisfied that the offender was neither offered a reward of any kind for doing what was asked of him and such money as he was given by May after the shooting, or the belongings of the deceased he was told he could have, were given as a pure gratuity. I am satisfied that the reference to $40,000 was most likely a means of aggrandizing his own importance. 
     
      
       
      The assessment of objective criminality 
       
      
    34 In light of the findings of fact that I have made, when viewed objectively, the murder is in my opinion just outside the worst category of case. It was a murder planned by one and executed by another in cold blood and in a milieu of drug dealing where financial motivations dominated. However, the fact that this offender killed at the request of and ultimately on the command of the person who had the primary motive to kill, operates to distinguish his criminality from that of his co-offender. That offender is in the worst category of case. 
     
      
    35 The fact that the deceased was a drug dealer and a drug user has no bearing at all on the way I must approach the punishment of the man who killed him. No life is any more valuable than another. Equally, no killing of another is ever regarded by the law as more or less serious because of the personal circumstances of the deceased or what others think of that person, or for that matter because that person’s contribution to community life is either commendable, on the one hand, or harmful on the other. Life itself is what the law and the community prize above all else. This is reflected in the fact that life imprisonment is the maximum penalty for murder.  
     
      
    36 In the Victim Impact Statement read to the Court by the deceased’s mother, Mrs Heaven, she described the deceased as a loving and treasured son and a valuable member of a close-knit family. She acknowledged that he had difficult times in his life (no doubt a reference to his drug addiction over many years) but she told the Court that her support for her only son did not waver. I accept that the report of his death, and the three years intervening before this offender detailed the circumstances in which it occurred, have left a permanent scar on her emotional life and have impacted on her ability to work in her chosen and valued calling as a school counsellor. I extend my sympathies to her and her family for their loss.  
     
      
    37 In the final paragraph of her statement, Mrs Heaven appealed to me to deliver justice for her son. It is important that I make it clear that this sentencing exercise is not directed to that end. This sentencing exercise is primarily directed to imposing a sentence of imprisonment on this offender that will, in my assessment, meet what the community can and should expect of a system of justice that is as responsive to the community it serves as it must be to the established principles of law that have developed to give consistency to its expression. It may not be easy for the family of the deceased to accept that a life taken will not be paid for with a life in prison, but that is not the law. Although life imprisonment is a punishment that is available to be imposed for murder (see s 61 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, there is also power under the law to impose a lesser sentence (see s 21 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act).  
     
      
    38 The Crown Prosecutor, who represents the community in these proceedings, has submitted that a lesser sentence should be imposed in this case. That concession is made primarily because of the role this offender played in the murder and the assistance he has given and promises to continue to give to bring the principal offender to justice. In my view that is a concession properly made although, as I will make clear shortly, a lengthy period of imprisonment will be imposed nevertheless.  
     
      
       
      The weight of subjective considerations 
       
      
    39 There is much in the offender’s subjective circumstances that gives me an insight as to how and why he would behave as inhumanely as he did on 2 May 2003 where his criminal antecedents do not suggest he is a violent or brutal man. While his subjective circumstances would not of themselves detract from a long period of imprisonment, even life imprisonment, in my assessment his behaviour since at least August 2006 also weighs against the imposition of a life sentence. He has not only acknowledged his guilt and ultimately entered a plea of guilty to murder, in his dealings with police he has revealed himself as a man who has been struggling with his conscience. He has ultimately found the appropriate expression for it. While the killing of the deceased was in every sense cold blooded he was unable to live with himself as a killer. The extract of the conversation with the informant I referred to earlier is testimony to that fact. A man without conscience would have put the death out of his mind. Ironically, it was his inability to put the killing behind him that unmasked him as the murderer. Were it not for his surfacing conscience the murder may well have gone unsolved and the murderer unpunished. 
     
      
    40 The offender tendered two reports prepared by Dr Bruce Westmore, a forensic psychiatrist, dated 22 March 2007 and 3 May 2007 and a character reference written by Marina Tyler. His mother also gave some evidence on her son’s behalf. 
     
      
    41 The prisoner was born in Sydney on 30 June 1980. He is currently 26 years of age. He has a four year old son and a two year old daughter and, until the date of his arrest, was living in a long-term de facto relationship with the children’s mother.  
     
      
    42 He was raised by his own mother as a sole parent. His mother and father separated when he was six months old after which he had no contact with his father. He had no father figure in his formative years. He has no siblings. When the offender was eight years of age, his mother left him in the care of her former partner, Marina Tyler. The following is taken from Ms Tyler’s written reference that was tendered in sentencing proceedings: 
     
      
       
        
        “As a young man he was very likeable and caring and always ready to be of assistance to us when possible. 
         
         
        As he grew older he was somewhat a “lost child” emotionally immature and very easily led and always trying to please and very loyal.” 
        
       
      
    43 The offender’s mother gave similar evidence in sentence proceedings: 
     
      
       
        
        Q. Did he start to exhibit behavioural defects as a child? 
         
         
        A. Around the age of eight and nine, some separation anxiety. He was very lonely, a lost sort of child, and always willing to want to please others. His biggest thing was to be someone’s best friend. 
        
       
      
    44 At the age of twelve, the offender moved to Redfern and back into his mother’s care. It was also at this time that the offender became involved in street gangs and started using cannabis. After some encounters with juvenile justice facilities he eventually found his way into a special educational unit for children. He was diagnosed with ADHD and a possible bipolar disorder. 
     
      
    45 The offender met May when he was aged thirteen at Edgeware Behavioural School in Surry Hills. This school was associated with a special educational unit. Evidence of the prisoner’s relationship with May was given by the prisoner’s mother and Dr Westmore. The offender’s mother stated in her evidence that: 
     
      
       
        
        “From day one, I never liked the association. I did not think anything good would come from it. If one of them was in trouble, both of them were together. It was a matter one would say jump, and Ryan would say – how high. We often fought over this, about this association with Scott and others. Ryan was a tall, strong boy. He has never harmed or hurt me. He would come in one door and go out the other. If Scott rang, out Ryan would go. For a while I could never work out the relationship. Ryan seemed to think of Scott as a brother he never had.” 
        
       
      
    46 She gave further evidence that she lost contact with her son as a teenager and often for significant periods. She also came to realise that he was using drugs. The offender was aged fourteen at the time. He left school after completing year eight. He has worked intermittently since then. His dominant skill is in carpentry although he has no trade certificate. 
     
      
    47 Dr Westmore reports that the offender progressed from cannabis to harder drugs such as cocaine, amphetamines, ice and heroin from a young age. His criminal record reflects the extent of his drug dependence with a variety of offences involving possession of drugs and a spread of offences of dishonesty which I consider likely to have been committed to support his drug habit.  
     
      
       
      Relevant sentencing principles 
       
      
    48 In R v MA (2004) 145 A Crim R434, the Court of Criminal Appeal characterised the operation of s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act as a codification and elaboration of the purposes of criminal punishment, which were described by the High Court in Veen v The Queen (No2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 476 : 
     
      
       
        
        [S]entencing is not purely a logical exercise, and the troublesome nature of the sentencing discretion arises in large measure from unavoidable difficulty in giving weight to each of the purposes of punishment. The purposes of criminal punishment are various: protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, retribution and reform. The purposes overlap and none of them can be considered in isolation from the others when determining what is an appropriate sentence in a particular case. They are guide posts to the appropriate sentence but sometimes they point in different directions. 
        
       
      
    49 In Markarian v R (2005) 215 ALR 213, while the High Court declined to declare that the instinctive approach to sentencing represented the law in Australia, in the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ, their Honours said that the approach that sentencing courts should take is to weigh all relevant factors bearing upon sentence in reaching the conclusion as to the particular penalty that should be imposed giving each of them the weight that is merited in the particular circumstances. Their Honours also acknowledged that although the adding and subtracting of quantified figures in months or years from a notional starting point should not be the approach of a sentencing court, in order to ensure transparency in the reasoning employed to arrive at a given sentence, an arithmetical approach may be warranted in some cases. In cases where there is a discount for future assistance it is essential that there be some reference to the way in which the discount translates arithmetically in order to make patent to the prisoner the consequences, under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, should his offer of assistance be withdrawn (see generally R v Halls and Halls (2002) 127 A Crim R 209 and R v Waqa (No2) (2005) 156 A Crim R 454).  
     
      
    50 I have considered the operation of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act but, I do not propose in sentencing this offender to deal with the listed mitigating and aggravating factors seriatim. I will instead deal with only the most significant factors since it seems to me that it is an interplay of these factors that will dictate a sentence that meets the manifold purposes of punishment in this case. 
     
      
       
      Intoxication and mental illness 
       
      
    51 Dr Westmore’s reports and his review of hospital records support a finding that the offender has had significant psychological problems in the past including periods of drug-induced psychoses. He has had multiple admissions to psychiatric hospitals over the last four years, both before and after the murder. While in custody in 1999 he was housed in Ward D at Long Bay Prison. There was a differential diagnosis at these times of a psychotic illness either drug-induced or by reason of underlying schizophrenia. He is currently being prescribed anti-psychotic medication.  
     
      
    52 It is clear from the material before me that the offender has had a compromised capacity to cope with the stressors of life and to make educated life choices for many years by reason of either long term drug abuse, mental illness or a combination of both. In response to a question asked by me the offender said he had shared between a gram to two grams of cocaine with his partner the day of the murder and that at the time of the offence he was feeling the “effects” of cocaine amongst “other drugs” including “pot and a few pills, like benzos”. On repeated occasions in the interviews with police the offender referred to his drug use at the time and the fact that under their influence he felt invincible. I am satisfied that he was not seeking to exaggerate his drug use to justify his actions on the night of the murder, but was endeavouring to explain what he did that night and to describe the extent of his disordered thinking. In recounting the brutal facts of the killing he at no time sought to deflect responsibility for his actions or to underplay the magnitude of his actions in first shooting the deceased in the chest and then firing two more shots into his body when he was on the ground. 
     
      
    53 Against this history, the issue of whether the offender was intoxicated at the time of the offence needs to be addressed for sentencing purposes. Dr Westmore also gave evidence that the offender’s thought patterns were “disturbed” and that “[h]is mental state would have made him more susceptible to manipulation by his co-offender”: 
     
      
       
        
        Q. Is it your opinion that although this offence couldn’t be said to have been committed in a situation where this offender was suffering from a drug induced psychosis, from the history you were given he may well have been suffering from certain aspects of thought disorder at the time of the offence? 
         
         
        A. Suffering from an abnormal psychology at the time, on his history he had consumed substances around the time of the incident, there would have been a degree of intoxication. We know he has a history predating this incident of psychotic symptoms. The earliest history I found was back to 1999 at Rozelle Hospital where he was thought to have had a drug induced psychosis. It is likely he was suffering from disturbances of his thinking. I was not able to identify clearly psychotic conditions or able to link them to the offending behaviour. In a man like this (with a) predisposition to developing mental illness on the ingestion of drugs he would have had disturbances in his mental state. (sic) 
         
         
        Q. Is it the case the very fact he could give a detailed history in relation to the offence suggests to you he was not suffering from a drug induced psychosis at the time of the offence? 
         
         
        A. That even of itself does not exclude that possibility but it does suggest he was not so intoxicated with drugs he was organically confused. 
        
       
      
    54 While not irrelevant to the sentencing exercise, I do not consider that the use of drugs on the day of the murder mitigates this offender’s criminal responsibility. Neither am I of the view that it is an aggravating factor (Coleman v R (1990) 47 A Crim R 306). I do however take into account the fact that he suffered from a mental illness at the time of the murder, a condition likely, in Dr Westmore’s opinion, to be exacerbated by long term and persistent drug abuse, and that this condition rendered him both vulnerable to manipulation by his co-offender and impeded his capacity for clear and reasoned thought. While I cannot ignore the fact that his mental condition in Dr Westmore’s view played a contextual part in the offending, I am also of the view that the weight it should be given in the sentencing exercise is such that it will only marginally moderate his sentence. This is not a case where it can be said that the illness from which he suffers displaces the need for general deterrence in the sense that it is not in the interest of the community that this offender be the medium for making an example to others (see R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255 at [18] and [22] see also R v Z [2006] NSWCCA 342 per Adams J at [41]–[57]). The sentence imposed on this offender must signal in the strongest possible terms that to intentionally kill or seriously harm those who it is thought are competitors or rivals, or those who are thought to have somehow acted dishonourably, or even with outright animosity, will be met with heavy sentences.  
     
      
    55 I have no doubt that May prevailed upon the offender to kill the deceased well knowing that he could achieve his objectives via the agency of a person who he knew would not refuse to do what he was too cowardly to do himself. That however does little to reduce this offender’s responsibility for what I consider to be his conscious and voluntary act in arming himself and shooting to kill on command. I am left in no doubt that he had a full appreciation of the wrongfulness of what he was asked to do even if he was in the moment ill-equipped to resist what had been asked of him. 
     
      
       
      Contrition (s 21A(3)(i)) 
       
      
    56 The prisoner demonstrated what I regard as genuine remorse during sentencing proceedings. When questioned about how he felt about himself in relation to having committed the offence the prisoner responded: “Disgusted”. He also formally apologised to the family of the deceased.  
     
      
    57 Further indications of the prisoner’s remorse are found in the evidence of the Chaplain at the Long Bay Complex, Peter Colin Baines.  
     
      
       
        
        A. He has expressed nothing but horror at what he has done in taking a human life, taking the life of a son, the life of a father, family member. He has been horrified by what he has done. 
         
         
        Q. Given that you have daily contact with people in the institution, have you gauged the genuineness of his statements of contrition to you? 
         
         
        A. In my time, I have probably only found one other person in matters as serious as this, a murder, that has been as forthcoming with their sorrow as he has been, and he has stated that consistently. 
         
         
        Q. In relation to any indication of sorrow that he has given you, has that centred on concerns about the punishment he will face? 
         
         
        A. He is actually concerned, by expressing his sorrow, it will look like he is trying to make what he has done – he is almost reluctant to say how sorry he is, because he does not want that to cause him to receive less of a sentence. He realises the horror of what he has done. 
        
       
       
      Prospects of rehabilitation (s 21A(3)(h)) 
       
      
    58 Although I do not dismiss the offender’s mother’s belief that her son has reached a crossroad in his life, and that with the love and support of his family and their commitment to him, he can turn his life around, I prefer to place reliance on Dr Westmore’s views in so far as his prospects of rehabilitation are concerned. In his second report he stated: 
     
      
       
        
        If he can remain in sobriety from illicit drugs that will significantly improve his psychiatric and a forensic prognosis. His acknowledgment of the offence and his plea of guilty and the fact that he is to be a prosecution witness do have some positive prognostic implications. It indicates that he is accepting responsibility for committing the offence and that he is prepared to accept punishment for the offence…If he returns to any form of illicit drug use, then a relapse in his psychotic illness can be expected. 
        
       
      
    The plea of guilty and assistance to the authorities (s 21A(3)(k)(m)  and ss 22 and 23)59 I have decided to assess the utilitarian value of the plea and the offender’s assistance to the authorities and to arrive at a compound or composite discount. This is in recognition of the fact that there is a significant overlap between the factors inherent in both, namely contrition, and a willingness to cooperate, together with the fact that in so doing he is putting himself in the position where he will need protection in a segregated part of the prison structure for a substantial part of the sentence he is to serve. Evidence has been led to support the fact and extent of the disadvantage that he will suffer as a result. I take that into account. 
     
      
    60 Consistent with what this Court has said in SZ v R [2007] NSWCCA 19, it will only be in the exceptional case where a composite discount will exceed 50 per cent. I do not regard this case as exceptional. The offender pleaded guilty to murder in April of this year, that is four years after the murder and seven months after admitting to it upon his arrest. Although the plea is of significant utilitarian value I do not regard it as a plea entered at the earliest time. It would seem that the offender’s induced statement of January of this year, when he sought to qualify his responsibility for the death of the deceased by suggesting that he fired the gun because he thought the deceased was himself reaching for a weapon and, where he excluded the role that May played in the murder altogether must have delayed the plea being entered. I make no judgment adverse to him about his motives at that time. They may be understandable. The assistance to the authorities the offender now commits to giving however is very considerable. As I have said, without this offender’s commitment to giving evidence against May there would likely be no case against him. The decision to give evidence against the man who he believed to be his brother and only friend has all the hallmarks of the offender coming to a lasting recognition that his loyalty to this man was misplaced. 
     
      
       
      Sentence 
       
      
    61 In the result I propose to discount the sentence that would otherwise be imposed by 50 per cent, appointing 25 per cent for the plea and the factors to which I have referred as inherent in it, inclusive of past assistance, and 25 per cent for future assistance. I am conscious that in discounting the sentence by this measure that the objective seriousness of the offence and the purposes of punishment must not be undermined (see s 23(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act). 
     
      
    62 After giving due account to the fact that this was a brutal and cold blooded murder but that the role the offender played in it was subordinate to May, and after having given consideration to those aspects of this case that allow me some insights into how and why he acted as he did in killing on May’s command, I consider that an a undiscounted head-sentence would be in the order of 36 years. 
     
      
    63 I will reduce that sentence by 50 per cent to accommodate the offender’s entitlement to a discount for the plea of guilty and past assistance, and particularly his offer of future assistance. I specify that one half of the discount is referrable to future assistance.64 Having taken into account matters bearing upon his mental health, and the fact that he will spend his sentence on protection, but conscious that there must remain a reasonable proportion between the sentence to be served and the objective seriousness of the offending, I am not persuaded that there should be a departure from the proportion of non-parole period to total term which is provided for in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  
     
      
    65 For the same reasons, and taking into account the interplay of factors under s 21A, the non-parole period will be less than the standard non-parole period provided for in Division 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     
      
    66 Accordingly, I set a non-parole period of 13 years and six months against a total term of imprisonment of 18 years. Both terms are to commence on 16 August 2006, the date the offender went into custody. The non-parole period will expire on 16 February 2020. The total term will expire on 16 August 2024. The offender will be eligible for release to parole on 15 August 2020.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 KIRBY J: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    3 HOWIE J: After a lengthy trial before Whealy J (the Judge) and a jury, Ida Ronen and her two sons, Nitzan Ronen and Izhar Ronen, were convicted of two offences contrary to the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (the Act) arising from a conspiracy between them to defraud the Commonwealth of taxation revenue. They were sentenced to terms of imprisonment on 7 October 2005; [2005] NSWSC 991. By notices dated 26 October 2005 the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions has appealed against what is asserted to be the inadequacy of the sentences imposed. The Ronens have sought leave to appeal against the sentences and for convenience I shall refer to them as the applicants. 
     
      
    4 The first charge alleged a conspiracy between about 1 October 1991 and 15 September 1995 contrary to s 86A of the Act. The second charge alleged a conspiracy between 16 September 1995 and 6 February 2001 to commit an offence against s 29D of the Act contrary to s 86(2) of the Act. Although there were two counts on the indictment, it was the Crown’s allegation that there was a single conspiracy on foot over the period from 1991 to 2001. The two counts reflected the fact that during the period of the conspiracy there was a change to the statutory provisions prescribing the offences charged. According to the relevant provision at the time of the commission of each of the offences, the prescribed maximum penalty for each offence was relevantly imprisonment for 20 years. However, after the offences were committed but before the appellants were sentenced, there was another legislative change and a question arises as to the effect of that change on the maximum penalty prescribed for the offences. 
     
      
    5 Mrs Ronen also pleaded guilty at the commencement of the sentencing proceedings to an offence contrary to s 31 of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 (Cth). That offence alleged that between 7 and 10 April 2000 she was knowingly concerned in conducting 11 cash transactions each of less than $10,000 in value which were structured so as to avoid reporting requirements under that Act. The maximum penalty for that offence is relevantly five years imprisonment. 
     
      
    6 Mrs Ronen was sentenced as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Count 1: Imprisonment for five years to commence on 28 January and to expire on 27 January 2010. 
         
         
        Count 2: Imprisonment for six years and six months to commence on 28 January 2007 and to expire on 27 July 2009. 
         
         
        S 31 offence: Imprisonment for eight months to commence on 28 January 2005 and to expire on 27 September 2005. 
        
       
       
      This is a total sentence of imprisonment for eight years and six months from 28 January 2005. The Judge specified a non-parole period of four years and six months to expire on 27 July 2009. 
       
      
    7 Nitzan Ronen and Izhar Ronen were each sentenced as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1: Imprisonment for five years to commence on 28 January 2005 
         
         
        Count 2: Imprisonment for six years six months to commence on 28 January 2007. 
         
        
       
      This is a total sentence of eight years and six months from 28 January 2005. The Judge specified a non-parole period of five years and six months to expire on 27 July 2010. 
       
       
      The facts 
      
    8 The facts upon which the Judge sentenced the applicants were not in dispute and can be summarised briefly. The offences arose during the course of the operation of a clothing business that involved a number of companies trading in the retail and wholesale clothing industry. Each of the applicants was a director of, and shareholder in, these companies. There were a number of factory outlets selling clothing manufactured by the companies to the public at discount prices. These shops were operated by Ida Ronen. They had a large cash turnover. The applicants agreed to defraud the Commonwealth of income tax by concealing a substantial proportion of the cash income from these shops. 
     
      
    9 The Judge stated when sentencing the applicants that he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that over the period of about a decade that this conspiracy was in operation the amount concealed was somewhere between 15 and 17 million dollars. 
     
      
    10 The agreement was that Ida Ronen on behalf of herself and her sons took most, if not all, of the cash received at the shops and distributed it to herself and her sons for their own purposes. Much of it was sent overseas. At the time of their arrest there was a sum of $209,525.00 in a safe in Mrs Ronen’s unit ready for distribution to Nitzan Ronen. Mrs Ronen meticulously recorded the actual takings from each of the shops and the amounts distributed by her. None of the cash taken by the applicants was declared as income in their personal tax returns or those of the companies. 
     
      
    11 After 1 July 2000 the Goods and Services Tax was introduced. The applicants had to devise a system for overcoming this hurdle. Mrs Ronen, secretly from her sons, involved her then de facto husband in the conspiracy in order that he could devise calculations to take into account the GST. These calculations were recorded in a computer kept at Mrs Ronen’s unit. Mrs Ronen also set about creating a set of false till rolls that would show a reduced amount of cash received at the shops. These false records were created on a cash register kept at Mrs Ronen’s unit for this purpose. By this method no more than ten per cent of the cash takings was banked. 
     
      
    12 The conspiracy came to light by chance during the lawful interception of a phone service in connection with an unrelated matter. Conversations alerted the authorities to the fact that the applicants were sending large amounts of money overseas. Surveillance was then undertaken on Mrs Ronen’s home where eventually a search warrant was executed on 7 February 2001. On that date the three applicants were arrested. 
     
      
    13 The additional offence to which Mrs Ronen pleaded guilty related to the amount of $99,395 sent to a bank in Israel to accounts of which she was the beneficiary. This was cash taken from the retail shops and had not been declared as income. On 7 April 2000 the money was collected by a chartered accountant on Mrs Ronen’s behalf and banked into a number of different banks by way of amounts structured so as to avoid the reporting conditions under the relevant legislation. The Judge held that this was part and parcel of the conspiracy in which the applicants were involved. 
     
      
    14 Following their convictions but before the sentencing proceedings, the appellants entered into a settlement of civil proceedings between them, their companies and the Commissioner of Taxation (the Commissioner). The settlement followed mediation sought by the applicants. I shall refer to this matter in more detail later as one of the applicant’s grounds of appeal relates to the weight to be given to the fact that the applicants had paid a considerable amount of money to the Commissioner as a penalty for their failure to divulge all of their income during the period of the conspiracy. 
     
      
       
      Subjective considerations 
      
    15 Mrs Ronen was aged 72 at the date of sentencing and was not in good physical health. She suffered from osteoporosis, lower back pain and osteoarthritis of both knees. She had conjunctivitis and bilateral cataracts. She also suffered high blood pressure and at the time of sentencing was anxious and depressed. There was a psychiatric report in evidence that set out her background but it is unnecessary to repeat it here, as it has no particular relevance to the outcome of the appeals. Mrs Ronen learned the clothing trade in Israel and established a business there before coming to Australia in the 1970s with her two sons. The Judge accepted that, as well as being a successful business woman, she worked hard to establish her business and was a good mother to her sons. 
     
      
    16 Because of her age and poor physical and mental health, the Judge concluded that Mrs Ronen would find the prison experience more difficult than it would be for a younger woman in good health. The psychiatrist recommended that she be referred to the Prison Psychiatric Services if she were sentenced to imprisonment. 
     
      
    17 There were a large number of references and testimonials placed before the sentencing court attesting to Mrs Ronen’s qualities as a mother, grandmother and friend. They noted her charitable works and the assistance she had provided to Bulgarian immigrants arriving in this country. They also referred to her contrition and the responsibility she felt towards her two sons in relation to the offending. 
     
      
    18 Nitzan Ronen was 47 years of age at the date of sentencing. He was married and had four children ranging from six and a half years to one year of age. The children were having difficulties coping with the loss of their father to prison. There was a psychiatric report in evidence stating that he admitted his guilt and regretted his conduct and the effect of it upon his children. He was depressed and angry. 
     
      
    19 There were also a number of references placed before the Court relating to this applicant. The Judge said of these: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The picture created is of a philanthropic man with strong feelings for his own family and for other families with difficulties. He is also depicted, as is undoubtedly the case, as a hard and industrious worker with considerable skill and experience in the clothing industry. 
        
       
      
    20 Izhar Ronen was 46 years of age at the date of sentencing. He was born in Israel and came to Australia at the age of 15. Like his brother he became involved in the clothing business shortly after completing his Higher School Certificate. He was married with two children aged 17 and 16. His younger child, a son, had been particularly affected by his father’s imprisonment. The applicant told the psychiatrist that he believed he had brought shame on the family. There were also in evidence testimonials as to his generosity and hard work. 
     
      
    21 The Judge said this about the general subjective circumstances of the applicants: 
     
      
       
        
         
        There is an obviously tragic aspect to the situation in which each of the offenders now finds himself or herself. Each offender is a person of previous unblemished good character. Each has worked very hard in the establishment and continuance of a highly successful business. Each offender is well regarded in the community especially in the Jewish community where they have practiced philanthropy at a high level. Each is regarded as an outstanding family member and is well regarded by friends and acquaintances in the business world and generally. Yet, each is imprisoned awaiting sentence for crimes of the most serious content. 
         
         
        
       
      The Judge noted the impact of a sentence of imprisonment would have on the families of the brothers but could not find that there was anything exceptional that would permit him to impose a lesser sentence on that account. 
       
      
    22 Although the applicants had pleaded not guilty to the offences on the indictment and the trial had been a lengthy one, the Judge found that contrition and remorse had been demonstrated by them. He noted that after they were convicted “the realisation of their wrongdoing came home to each offender in a markedly emphatic manner”. The Judge also noted that the settlement of the civil actions with the Commissioner was a practical demonstration of remorse. Notwithstanding that remorse and contrition came late in the day, the Judge held that it was a matter that he could and should take into account in assessing their likelihood of re-offending and their prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
       
      The application for leave to appeal 
      
    23 There were four grounds argued on behalf of the applicants as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in finding that the maximum penalty for the offences under s 86A and s86(2) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), (the conspiracy offences), was 20 years imprisonment. 
         
         
        Ground 2: The sentencing judge failed to have proper regard to: 
         
          
           
            
            (a) the imposition of penalty tax upon the applicant's prior to the sentencing proceedings; 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (b) the general and specific deterrence attached to the imposition of penalty tax, and 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (c) the level of punishment inherent in the imposition of penalty tax. 
            
           
          
         
         
        Ground 3: The sentencing judge was in error in partially accumulating the sentence he imposed on count 2 with the sentence imposed in relation to count 1. 
         
         
        Ground 4: The sentences imposed in relation to the conspiracy offences were manifestly excessive. 
        
       
       
      The maximum penalty 
      
    24 The Judge found that the maximum penalty for each of the counts in the indictment was imprisonment for 20 years. As has already been noted, that was the penalty prescribed in respect of each of the offences charged by the provision creating the offence. However, s 86(2) of the Act, the most recent provision in the Act dealing with defrauding the Commonwealth, was repealed on 24 May 2001 by the Criminal Code Amendment (Theft, Fraud, Bribery and Related Offences) Act 1999 (the Amendment Act). In its place a series of offences were created in the Criminal Code (CTH) (the Code) by s 135.4. The maximum penalty prescribed for offences falling within that section is imprisonment for ten years. 
     
      
    25 When introducing the bill containing the new Code provisions on 24 November 1999, the Attorney General described the amendments as providing “a wide range of modern offences to protect the Commonwealth Government and public officials from criminals who would cause them financial harm or seek to obstruct, threatened or harm them”. The Attorney also stated, “The bill……replaces existing Crimes Act 1914 offences with a modern and transparent scheme for preventing and punishing theft, fraud, bribery, forgery and related offences”. He also noted that the bill “brings about uniformity in penalties for key offences, which have long differed between state and federal jurisdictions, and between different acts” and referred to the maximum penalty of 10 years for the fraud offence. 
     
      
    26 The Explanatory memorandum in relation to the Bill contained the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Like proposed s135.1, proposed s135.4 is a series of general dishonesty offences. Proof of deception is not required. Indeed it has all the same components as proposed s 135.1 except there must be a conspiracy. …… The other difference is that the maximum penalty is 10 years imprisonment. While conspiracy usually carries the same penalty as the primary offence, the proposed penalty reflects what was recommended for the Model Criminal Code (May 1997 report) and by the Gibbs Committee. Proposed s 135.1 will replace sub-s 86(2) of the  
        Crimes Act 1914 
         which has a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. This is far too high and is inconsistent with the penalty for similar offences in other jurisdictions. The usual maximum penalty is 10 years imprisonment. 
        
       
      
    27 The repeal of the previous provisions of the Act in relation to conspiracy to defraud was effected by items 149 and 158 of Schedule 2 of the Amendment Act. There was a transitional provision contained in item 418 of Schedule 2 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        418. Transitional - pre-commencement of offences 
         
         
        1. Despite the amendment or repeal of a provision by this Schedule, that provision continues to apply, after the commencement of this item, in relation to: 
         
         
          
          (a) an offence committed before the commencement of this item; or 
           
           
          (b) proceedings for an offence alleged to have been committed before the commencement of this item; or 
           
           
          (c) any matter connected with, or arising out of, such proceedings 
           
           
          as if the amendment or repeal had not been made. 
           
          
         
        2. Subitem (1) does not limit the operation of section 8 of the  
        Acts Interpretation Act 1901 
        
       
      
    28 Section 8 of the Acts Interpretation Act is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        8 Effect of repeal  
         
         
        Where an Act repeals in the whole or in part a former Act, then unless the contrary intention appears the repeal shall not:  
         
         
          
          (a) revive anything not in force or existing at the time at which the repeal takes effect; or 
           
          (b) affect the previous operation of any Act so repealed, or anything duly done or suffered under any Act so repealed; or 
           
          (c) affect any right privilege obligation or liability acquired accrued or incurred under any Act so repealed; or 
           
          (d) affect any penalty forfeiture or punishment incurred in respect of any offence committed against any Act so repealed; or 
           
          (e) affect any investigation legal proceeding or remedy in respect of any such right privilege obligation liability penalty forfeiture or punishment as aforesaid; 
           
          and any such investigation legal proceeding or remedy may be instituted continued or enforced, and any such penalty forfeiture or punishment may be imposed, as if the repealing Act had not been passed. 
          
         
        
       
      
    29 A further statutory provision relevant to the argument arising from this ground of appeal is s 4F(2) of the Crimes Act which relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Where a provision of a law of the Commonwealth reduces the penalty or maximum penalty for an offence, the penalty or the maximum penalty as reduced extends to offences committed before the commencement of that provision, but the reduction does not affect any penalty imposed before that commencement. 
        
       
       
      This provision was inserted into the Act by the  
      Crimes Legislation Amendment Act 1987 (Cth) 
       and a similar provision had been contained in s 45A of the  
      Acts Interpretation Act 
      . The Explanatory Memorandum in relation to the amendments made by s 4F(2) and related provisions states: 
       
        
         
        The intention of those sub sections is to ensure that a change in a penalty will not be to the detriment of a person convicted of an offence committed before, but for which he or she was sentenced subsequent to, the change. 
        
       
      
    30 The applicants argue that s 4F(2) operates in respect of the provisions under which they were charged such that the repeal of those offences from the Crimes Act and the creation of replacement offences in the Code with a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years resulted in the applicable maximum penalty to which the applicants were liable being 10 years and not 20 years as prescribed by the repealed provisions. 
     
      
    31 The argument was that, because the offences in the Code are in substance the same as those with which the applicants were charged, it should be taken that the maximum penalty for an offence of defrauding or conspiring to defraud the Commonwealth has been reduced regardless of the particular statutory basis for such an offence. It was submitted that the term “an offence” for the purposes of s 4F(2) should be considered broadly in order to achieve the beneficial purpose of the provision rather than denying its effect by a too formalistic or technical approach. The argument was that, although item 418 of the transitional provisions in the Amendment Act does not affect the application of s 8 of the Acts Interpretation Act, s 8 only applies “unless the contrary intention appears” and s 4F(2) evinces a contrary intention displacing s 8. 
     
      
    32 In my opinion the argument should be rejected for very much the same reasons as the sentencing Judge rejected it. The simple fact is that the maximum sentence prescribed by the repealed Crimes Act provisions were not reduced in any real sense. It is artificial in my view to describe the repeal of one offence and the enactment of a different offence as a reduction in the sentence for the repealed offence. Although the offences in s 135.4 of the Code may cover the same criminal activity as did the repealed Crimes Act provisions, they are different offences with different elements and are affected by the Code’s provisions in relation to criminal responsibility in Chapter 2. The provisions of the Crimes Act were interpreted according to common law principles that are not completely identical to those that apply to the Code offences. For example, there is no requirement under the Code that the prosecution prove that the offender used dishonest means in carrying out the fraud as there was under the provision in the Act: see Peters v The Queen (1998) 192 CLR 493. It is clear from the second reading speech of the Attorney General that the new offences in the Code were not seen by the legislature as being simply a re-enactment of the offences in the Crimes Act and they should not be treated as if they were. 
     
      
    33 Had the legislature intended that the penalty for the repealed offences should be reduced in line with the new Code offences, it could have said so in plain language within the transitional provisions. I doubt that the legislature intended that this result should be derived from the somewhat convoluted path argued for by the applicants. To the contrary, the specific transitional provision in item 418 on its face and by its preservation of the operation of s 8 of the Acts Interpretation Act contemplates that the repealed provisions would continue to apply to offences committed before 24 May 2001 in all their aspects including the prescribed maximum penalties. 
     
      
    34 Of course it should be borne in mind that it was not just the fraud provisions of the Crimes Act that were being repealed and replaced with new offences in the Code. The Attorney noted in the second reading speech that the bill “simplifies and reduces the size of the Commonwealth statute book by repealing over 250 offences which cover conduct dealt with by the new offences”. The fraud offences were only part of the scheme of offences that was introduced into the Code by the amending legislation. 
     
      
    35 Section 4F is a general provision concerned not only with the reduction in penalty for an offence but also with the situation where the penalty for an offence is increased. In my opinion it is concerned with variations in penalties for existing offences and not with the creation of new offences, whether or not they happen to correspond in some general, unspecific way with offences that they replace. 
     
      
    36 The applicant’s relied upon R v Melville (2003) 27 WAR 224. That was a case where the offence of rape under a provision of the Criminal Code (WA) had been repealed and replaced by an offence of sexual assault in the same Act. The penalty for rape was life imprisonment but the penalty for sexual assault was imprisonment for 14 years. The new offence was broader than the offence of rape because of the expanded definition of “sexual penetration”. Section 10 of the Sentencing Act (WA) stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        If the statutory penalty for an offence changes between the time when the offender committed it and the time when the offender is sentenced for it the lesser statutory penalty applies for the purposes of sentencing the offender. 
         
        
       
      
    37 The question arose whether the statutory penalty for rape had been reduced to 14 years imprisonment. A majority of the Court, Murray and Anderson JJ, thought that it had by reason of s 10. They interpreted the words “offence” in that section to mean “an act or omission committed in circumstances which make it punishable as an offence”; per Murray J. There was an identity between the act and the circumstances in both the old offence of rape and the new offence of sexual assault: all of the ingredients of the offence of rape having been included in the offence of sexual assault: per Anderson J. 
     
      
    38 McKechnie J was in the minority. He held that the offence of rape had not become the offence of sexual assault because the elements of the two offences were different. His Honour interpreted s 10 to read in the case before the Court, “If the statutory penalty for rape changes between the time when the offender committed it (ie prior to 1 April 1986) and the time the offender is sentenced for it (ie 2003) the lesser statutory penalty applies for the purpose of sentencing the offender.” 
     
      
    39 With respect I prefer the reading of the section adopted by McKechnie J. As did his Honour, I believe that such a provision is intended to operate only where the actual penalty for the precise offence is amended and not where an existing offence is replaced with another offence even though the two offences may have some common features or may be addressing similar prohibited conduct. In any event, the present is a different situation than that which was being considered by the Court in Melville because here, as I have already noted, it was not simply the replacement of one offence in one statute with another offence in the same statute. There were specific transitionary provisions contained in the amending legislation that in my view operated according to their terms. Section 4F(2) did not in my opinion evince a contrary intention to s 8, a provision that was specifically applied by the transitional provisions. 
     
      
    40 The Crown relied upon Chief Executive Officer of Customs v Derbas (2002) 167 FLR 269 a decision of this Court dealing with offences under the Excise Act (Cth). In that case there was an increase in the prescribed pecuniary penalty for an offence after the commission of the offence by the respondent. In the District Court, and contrary to the view taken by the sentencing magistrate, it was held that the increase in penalty did not apply. A case was then stated to this Court. The section being considered was s 4F(1) that in effect provides that an increased penalty does not apply to an offence committed before the increase came into effect. The Court held that the transitional provision relating to the increased penalty was specific and prevailed over the general provision in s 4F(1) so that the increased penalty was to apply to the respondent. Although this is an example of a specific provision over-riding the general provision, that was a much clearer case than the present and I do not believe it assists significantly in determining the present ground of appeal. 
     
      
    41 However, notwithstanding that I am of the opinion that the maximum penalty was imprisonment for 20 years for the conspiracy offences, it may not necessarily follow that the fact that the maximum penalty for the fraud offences in the Code is imprisonment for 10 years is totally irrelevant. The Judge in the present case, as a matter of fairness and justice, took into account the change in attitude of the Parliament to the seriousness of the type of offences committed by the applicants when determining the appropriate sentences to impose upon them. The Crown has argued on its appeal that the Judge was in error in his approach in this regard and I will address this matter when dealing with the Crown appeal. 
     
      
       
      The relevance of penalty tax 
      
    42 As was noted earlier, the applicants were prepared to enter into mediation with the Commissioner in relation to outstanding civil proceedings in respect of unpaid taxes and, before the sentencing proceedings commenced, had entered into terms of settlement with the Commissioner. Those terms are to remain secret but some reference can be made to the result of the settlement. It has been noted that the Judge took into account the conduct of the applicants in this regard as being evidence of contrition on their part. 
     
      
    43 The Judge had evidence before him that the Commissioner had imposed penalties under s 226J of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) (the Tax Act) of $7,180.508.00. By the time that the appeal was heard the whole of that amount had been paid. 
     
      
    44 Section 226J is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        226J Penalty tax where shortfall caused by intentional disregard of law 
         
         
        Subject to this Part, if: 
         
         
          
          (a) the taxpayer has a tax shortfall for a year; and 
           
           
          (b) the shortfall or part of that was caused by the intentional disregard by the taxpayer or by a registered tax agent of this Act or the regulations; 
          
         
         
        the taxpayer is liable to pay, by way of penalty for the additional tax equal to 75% of the amount of the shortfall or part. 
        
       
       
      Relevant definitions in the Tax Act are: 
       
        
         
        “Tax shortfall"", in relation to a taxpayer and a year, means the amount, if any, by which the taxpayer's statement tax for that year at the time at which it was lowest is less than the taxpayer’s proper tax for that year. 
         
         
        ""Proper tax"", in relation to a taxpayer and a year, means the tax properly payable by the taxpayer in respect of that year on the taxpayer’s taxable income after allowing credits property available to the taxpayer. 
        
       
      
    45 In the course of the sentencing remarks the Judge referred to the principles applicable to sentencing for offences of fraud on the revenue as set out in R v O’Connor (2002) 129 A Crim R 505 at 537. It is unnecessary to set them out in this judgment because, except in respect of one matter, there was no suggestion by the applicants that the Judge had erred in relation to the sentencing principles he applied. The only matter that was in dispute before the Judge and in this Court was the effect to be given to the fact that the applicants had paid a considerable amount by way of penalty tax. 
     
      
    46 The Judge quoted with approval from a passage in Sheller JA’s judgment in DPP v Hamman (NSWCCA, unreported, 1 December 1998). That was a Crown appeal against a sentence imposed in the District Court for offences under s 29B and s 29D of the Crimes Act. Sheller JA stated (my underlining): 
     
      
       
        
         
        General deterrence is a predominate consideration when sentencing for offences of defrauding the revenue. 
         
         
        Appeal Courts have discussed and emphasised the seriousness of frauds committed to the detriment of the public revenue. Inevitably, the Australian system of tax collection depends upon the honesty of taxpayers and, in particular, upon their fully declaring in each year of income what their gross income is. In a free society, such as Australia, the tax collector cannot check that every taxpayer has done so. The effect of dishonesty and non-disclosure of income increases the burden on all other taxpayers and particularly those who have truly disclosed their gross income. This demonstrates the serious nature of the offences charged against the respondent and the importance when punishing such offences to put in the forefront of the principles to be applied that of general deterrence.  
         
         
        While undoubtedly it is a matter to be taken into account, it is, in my opinion, of small account, that when caught out the offender pays the tax due and additional tax by way of penalty for which the offender is liable to a greater or lesser extent, according to the Commissioner's discretion, whatever the reason for non-disclosure. 
         Past integrity and good character, devotion to family and work and contributions to the community, impeccable though they have been, carry little weight against the confession by a plea of guilty that over a period of three years which ended only when the respondent was caught out, the respondent knowingly on three occasions understated his income by very large amounts for his own benefit or advantage.  
         
        
       
      
    47 It was submitted to the Judge and to this Court on behalf of the applicants that the underlined passage was no longer good law in light of the decision of the High Court in Rich v Australian Securities and Investment Commission (2004) 220 CLR 129 because it pays too little regard to the significance that a penalty has been imposed upon the offender independent from, and additional to, that imposed by the court in respect of the same conduct. In Rich the Court held that there was no clear distinction between “protective” and “punitive” orders so that an order disqualifying a person from acting as a director of any company should be considered to be a penalty regardless of the purpose for which the order was made. The blurring of the distinction between the criminal and civil law in relation to penalties was recognised in Grey v Motor Accident Commission (1998) 196 CLR 1 at [16]. 
     
      
    48 It was argued on behalf of the applicants that the Judge had too much regard to general deterrence and gave insufficient weight to the imposition of an extra-curial penalty arising from the same conduct as that with which the Judge was concerned. It was submitted that the Judge overlooked the fact that civil penalties have a deterrent effect, as was recognised by Hayne J in Chief Executive Officer of Customs v Labrador Liquor Wholesale Pty Limited (2003) 216 CLR 161 at [114]. It was argued that significant weight should have been given to the payment of the penalty tax in order to avoid double punishment because the Commissioner imposed the penalties and chose not to remit them under s 227 of the Tax Act notwithstanding that the applicants had been convicted of the conspiracy offences with respect to the same subject matter. 
     
      
    49 Reliance was placed on behalf of the applicants upon statements of members of the Federal Court in R v Whitnall (1993) 42 FCR 512 as to the impact of a penalty administratively imposed by the Commissioner upon a court’s discretion to sentence an offender. Drummond J referred to the court’s discretion being to an extent fettered by the imposition of the penalty tax and thought that there was “an element of oppression involved in asking the court to deal severely with an offender who has already been heavily punished by the Commissioner”. 
     
      
    50 Reference was also made to the judgment of Hulme J in R v Gay [2002] NSWCCA 6 at [23] where his Honour expressed his disagreement with the statement made by Sheller JA in Hamman. After quoting from the passage in Hamman set out above, Hulme J wrote: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [23] So far as these remarks relate to payment of the tax due, I agree. An offender can claim small credit for performing his legal obligations in common with most of the community. The same may be said of so much of the additional tax as represents interest on tax not paid, certainly if this interest is at more or less a commercial rather than a punitive rate. However, I am unable to agree that payment of additional tax is necessarily to be regarded as of small account. If, of course, the amount of additional tax is small, or perhaps even if large, is of little consequence to a particular offender, this may be an appropriate view but otherwise it seems to me that the significance of the payment of additional tax should be assessed on its merits. If it amounts to a significant punishment in its own right, then it may well be that it should significantly mitigate the punishment which would otherwise be imposed.  
         
         
        [24] Sheller JA gave no authority or reasoning for his view. In Whitnall (at 125) Higgins J, with whom Drummond J agreed, said that the degree of hardship imposed by a pecuniary penalty imposed administratively was relevant. Drummond J went on to say that if a heavy penalty has been imposed by administrative action, there is an element of oppression involved in asking a court to then deal severely with the offender. It may be that that is not necessarily so in every case but it clearly is a distinct possibility. The preferable approach is to consider every case on its own merits recognising that, even though Parliament may have provided for 2 punishments, it has nowhere said that the quantum of the first should not be fairly taken into account in any determination of the second.  
         
         
        [25] Furthermore, it must also be relevant to consider all of the consequences to an offender of his criminality…….. 
        
       
       
      The other members of the Court in  
      Gay  
      did not expressly approve of these views although Mason P, with whom Hidden J agreed, noted the punitive element in the amended assessments and took into account delay in prosecution and the payment of penalty tax as reasons for reducing the sentence. 
       
      
    51 The principles set out in Hamman were applied by this Court in R v Cappadona (2001) 122 A Crim R 52. However, the sentences under review in that case were considered on the basis that no penalty tax had been, or was to be, paid by the respondents to the Crown appeal. Cappadona was applied in O’Connor but there was no reference in that case to any payments having been made to the Commissioner by way of penalty or otherwise. In seems to me that, in light of the decision in Rich, the statement in Hamman in relation to the weight to be given to the payment of penalty tax ought not to be followed if it is regarded as an inflexible sentencing principle. I favour the approach of Hulme J to the effect that each case should be considered on its own merits, but recognising that the payment of penalty tax is a form of punishment that has been imposed upon the offender in addition to that which the Court imposes by way of sentence. This is consistent with the approach that courts have taken to extra-curial punishments generally: see Application by the Attorney General under Section 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act for a Guideline Judgment Concerning the Offence of High Range Prescribed Concentration of Alcohol Under Section 9(4) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999 (No. 3 of 2002) (2004) 60 NSWLR 305 at [114]. 
     
      
    52 In many cases the extra-curial penalty might not be given great weight having regard to the need to denounce the criminal conduct by the imposition of a prison sentence and the importance of general deterrence that might not be reflected sufficiently in the payment of the penalty tax. Much might depend upon the capacity of the offender to pay the penalty or the effect that the penalty has had in real terms upon the offender. Hardship arising from the imposition of the tax penalty might be important in determining what further punishment is required to achieve its purpose of protecting the community. But the absence of hardship does not mean that little regard should be had to the additional penalty imposed administratively. 
     
      
    53 The Crown argued that the Commissioner does not impose the penalty at all and that the only discretion the Commissioner retains is to remit the payment. Material was placed before this Court to show that the Commissioner had no discretion to determine the rate of penalty tax under the different sections of the Tax Act because that was to be determined by the facts of the particular case. On the facts of the present matter s 226J applied so that the rate had to be 75 per cent. But that does not seem to me to be a matter of any great relevance. Even if the penalty was imposed by legislation, it does not mean that the court cannot or should not have regard to it and give it what weight it deserves in the particular case. Similarly the fact that there was nothing to show in the present case that the discretion of the Commissioner to remit the tax had been enlivened does not detract from the fact that the applicants had paid a not insignificant penalty before the Court imposed sentence. 
     
      
    54 There has been considerable debate, particularly by written submissions after the Court reserved its decision, as to the weight to be given in this case to `the penalty payment made having regard to the terms of settlement and other benefits the applicants might have received, such as by the remission of some part of their obligations under the Tax Act. Some account should be given of the history of the proceedings regarding reassessment and the settlement between the Commissioner and the applicants. 
     
      
    55 In 2001, as a result of material obtained from the execution of search warrants, the Commissioner issued amendment assessments of income-tax to the applicants and a company that they operated called On Fovo Pty Limited (On Fovo) under s 170(2)(a) of the Tax Act. The amended assessments related to the years of income ending 30 June 1993 to 30 June 1999 inclusive for Mrs Ronen and the years 30 June 1994 to 30 June 1999 inclusive for the company and the brothers. The assessments included assessments of primary tax, shortfall interest, and additional tax by way of penalty. Because the tax assessed was not paid by the due date, the company and the applicant became liable to pay the General Interest Charge (GIC) until the tax was paid. In 2001 the applicants paid part of the personal tax claimed by the Commissioner and the Commissioner accordingly reduced the rate at which GIC was levied. 
     
      
    56 Under the Tax Act penalty tax is payable under s 226G, s 226H and s226J of the Tax Act respectively at three rates: 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    · 25% when the tax shortfall is caused by lack of reasonable care.· 50% when the shortfall is caused by recklessness.· 75% when the shortfall is caused by intentional disregard of the law. 
     
      
       
      The present case was held to fall within the maximum rate of 75 per cent. There was a dispute between the parties about the exercise of discretion to remit the whole or part of the penalty tax payable under s 226J. I do not find it necessary to resolve this dispute for present purposes. 
       
      
    57 The Deed of Settlement sets out the amounts that it was agreed that the applicants and On Fovo would pay for primary tax, shortfall interest and penalty tax. It was agreed that, if the applicants and the company paid these amounts, the Commissioner would remit the GIC payable on post assessment amounts. There was an argument as to whether, in taking into account the amounts paid by the applicants, the Court should have regard to the remission of the GIC to offset the impact of the tax penalties. The Crown submitted that the Court should have regard to the payments of penalty tax in context of the settlement as a whole and, therefore, view the penalty paid against the amount of GIC waived. The applicants argued that the Commissioner obtained a benefit in the compromise between the parties by recovering from On Fovo and remitted the GIC for commercial reasons. Therefore, it was argued, it should not be taken into account to negate the impact of the penalties imposed. The Crown disputed that this inference could be drawn from the material before the Court. It points out that GIC has been considered as penal in nature: see Elias v Commissioner of Taxation (2002) 199 ALR 246 at [23]. 
     
      
    58 Shortfall interest is payable under s 1709AA of the Tax Act and is calculated in accordance with s 214A of that Act at a rate of 4 percent points above the 13 week Treasury Note. Shortfall interest is referrable to the period up to the date of the amended assessment. GIC is payable under s 204(3) of the Tax Act and relates to the post assessment period. To some degree it would appear that the applicants have received the benefit of interest free use of funds for some period and the victim of the fraud, being the Commonwealth, has not been fully compensated for being out of funds for that period. Nevertheless, the waiver of the GIC amounts was a consensual settlement. There can be no doubt that the amount of compensation paid to the victim of the fraud was a very substantial proportion of the loss incurred and this is entitled to weight in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. The Judge gave it such weight. 
     
      
    59 The Crown submitted that the weight to be given to the payment of the additional tax by way of penalty under s 226J of the Tax Act is affected by the fact that the taxpayers were not required to pay post assessment GIC. In my view this matter goes principally to the question of the degree of compensation paid and does not detract from the fact that a very substantial penalty has been imposed upon the applicants. 
     
      
    60 It should be accepted that the parties to the settlement each saw a benefit to be derived from the terms agreed upon. No doubt the applicant’s were legitimately seeking to obtain as much benefit as they could in the sentencing proceedings on the basis of the amount of penalty tax they were required to pay under the terms of settlement. However, it is difficult to assess the relevance of this amount as an extra-curial penalty when nothing is known about the ability of the applicants to pay it. There is no real suggestion of hardship other than that Mrs Ronen sold her unit in order to meet the tax liability. However, it remains unclear how much money was sent overseas or what was done with it. The applicant’s gave no evidence on the sentencing proceedings and there was no information as to the financial position of the companies in which the applicants were involved, other than On Fovo, or what assets the applicants had either in this country or overseas. If the applicants wish the Court to take into account the full impact of the penalty tax as a matter in mitigation of the sentence to be imposed by the Court, they have an onus of demonstrating the impact of the penalty upon them. Nevertheless on any view the amount paid by way of penalty tax was a very substantial amount indeed. Although its precise impact on the financial position of the applicants is not known, its very size will serve the purpose of personal and general deterrence to some degree. 
     
      
    61 Although the approach of the Judge to the taxation penalty was in accordance with binding authority of this Court, it seems to me with respect to have been erroneous when expressed as an immutable sentencing principle. However, before determining what should be the outcome of this error, I will deal with the remaining grounds of appeal. 
     
      
       
      The accumulation of sentences 
      
    62 The applicants argue that the Judge erred in imposing partially cumulative sentences having regard to the fact that it was a technicality that there were two offences and not one. The Crown had always accepted that there was a single course of criminal conduct throughout the period of the offending. It was submitted that in those circumstances it was erroneous for the Judge to do other than impose completely concurrent sentences. 
     
      
    63 The Judge indicated that, according to Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610, “it is the duty of the sentencing court to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well as questions of totality”. After indicating the sentence for each offence, the Judge said, “I have concluded that a degree of accumulation is necessary in relation to the sentences because I consider that the criminality in the second offence cannot comprehend the total of the criminality in the two offences”. 
     
      
    64 It has been made clear that, generally speaking, it is a matter for the discretion of a sentencing judge whether to make sentences concurrent or cumulative: R v Hammoud (2000) 118 A Crim R 66. But one circumstance where that discretion must be exercised against imposing concurrent sentences is where the appropriate sentence for one offence cannot comprehend or reflect the criminality involved in all offences. It was well open to the Judge to determine that in this case the sentence for either one of the offences could not reflect the criminality involved in the entire conspiracy. If there had been one offence encompassing the whole of the criminality involved in the conspiracy, the penalty for that offence ought to have been greater than that imposed by the Judge for each of the offences. In my opinion it would have been an error for the Judge to have imposed purely concurrent sentences, as that course would have required him to inappropriately inflate the sentence for one of the offences in order to comprehend the total criminality of them both. 
     
      
       
      Manifestly excessive sentence 
      
    65 In my opinion the sentences were not manifestly excessive having regard to the criminality involved in the applicants’ offending. In my opinion the Judge was correct to consider that the offending was within the worst category given the length of time over which the conspiracy operated, the amount of money defrauded from the Commonwealth and the manner in which the fraud was carried out. There was little mitigation due to the subjective features of the applicants having regard to the period of the offending and its systematic nature. 
     
      
    66 The only error in the sentencing Judge’s reasoning that was disadvantageous to the applicants that I can identify was the error as to the weight to be given to the payment of the taxation penalties. But in my opinion the criminality of the applicants was so great that the payment of the penalty tax, particularly in the absence of any evidence as to what it meant in real terms to the applicants, could be given limited weight having regard to the purposes of punishment for this type of offending. It has been stated time and time again and in all jurisdictions that the most important aspect of punishment in relation to frauds on the Commonwealth’s revenue is general deterrence. Although I accept that the payment of a penalty tax can have a deterrent effect, it is not usually of the same magnitude in white collar crime as that arising from the imprisonment of persons who are otherwise of good character and are well respected in the community. Further, it was particularly important in this case to denounce almost a decade of persistent, fraudulent conduct in contempt of the taxation laws and motivated by pure greed. The payment of the penalty tax could not sufficiently achieve that purpose. A heavy personal penalty in addition to the financial penalties imposed upon the applicants and On Fovo was called for in this case. 
     
      
    67 Even giving full weight to the payment of the taxation penalty I am not persuaded that any lesser sentences are warranted so serious was the offending by the applicants: see s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 and R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704. The non-parole period imposed upon Mrs Ronen adequately reflected her particular subjective circumstances and the difficulty she would face serving a sentence of imprisonment. 
     
      
    68 I would grant the applicants leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
       
      The Crown appeal 
      
    69 The Crown relied upon two grounds of appeal as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Ground 1: The sentences imposed were manifestly inadequate. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 2: The level of accumulation was inadequate 
        
       
       
       
      Manifest inadequacy 
      
    70 The Crown argued that the Judge should not have taken into account the maximum penalty for the offences under the Code or what was said about the maximum penalty for the repealed offences in the Executive Memorandum. The Crown submitted that to take into account the 10 year maximum penalty for the Code offences was to act contrary to the legislature’s wishes as evidenced by the transitional provisions that preserved the maximum penalty for the repealed offences for prosecutions of those offences after their repeal. The Crown alternatively submitted that, if the Judge was entitled to take into account the legislative changes, this could only result in a “modest reduction in the sentence”. 
     
      
    71 It is unusual in my experience to find a parliament acknowledging by act or statement that a legislatively prescribed penalty was excessive for the criminality inherent in the offence to which it related. Yet that is what occurred in the present case. In the future offenders, such as the applicants, will face a maximum penalty under the Code that is half of that which applied under the Act. The Executive Memorandum contains a clear acknowledgment that the penalty under the Act was “far too high”. It is impossible in my opinion for a court, sentencing persons such as the applicants for offences under the Act, to ignore these two indications of Parliament’s change of mind as to the seriousness with which it views the kind of conduct that was committed by the applicants. 
     
      
    72 The courts have always treated the maximum penalty for an offence as a pronouncement of the policy of the legislature: R v Oliver (1980) 7 A Crim R 174 at 177. The maximum penalty reflects the seriousness of the crime in the mind of the public as given voice through parliament: R v H (1980) 3 A Crim R 53 at 65. In the joint judgment in Markarian v The Queen (2005) 79 ALJR 1048 at [30], their Honours wrote: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [30] Legislatures do not enact maximum available sentences as mere formalities. Judges need sentencing yardsticks. It is well accepted that the maximum sentence available may in some cases be a matter of great relevance. In their book Sentencing, Stockdale and Devlin. observe that: 
         
          
           
           A maximum sentence fixed by Parliament may have little relevance in a given case, either because it was fixed at a very high level in the last century … or because it has more recently been set at a high catch-all level … At other times the maximum may be highly relevant and sometimes may create real difficulties … 
          
         
         
          
           A change in a maximum sentence by Parliament will sometimes be helpful [where it is thought that the Parliament regarded the previous penalties as inadequate]. 
          
         
         
        [31] It follows that careful attention to maximum penalties will almost always be required, first because the legislature has legislated for them; secondly, because they invite comparison between the worst possible case and the case before the court at the time; and thirdly, because in that regard they do provide, taken and balanced with all of the other relevant factors, a yardstick. ……………… 
         
        
       
      
    73 I find it impossible, consistently with this approach, to ignore legislative acts or statements that indicate that Parliament’s view of the seriousness of particular criminal conduct, as reflected in the maximum penalty for an offence punishing that conduct, has changed. This is particularly so where the offending occurs at a time relatively proximate to the expression of the change of view. The applicants’ criminal conduct came to an end in 2001 the same year that the legislation was amended. 
     
      
    74 In my opinion the Judge was correct to take into account the change in the legislature’s attitude to this type of offending and to reduce the impact of the maximum penalty accordingly. Even though the transitional provisions retained the maximum penalty, those provisions applied to all the offences that were being repealed and not simply the offence with which the applicants had been charged. That general provision as it applied to the applicants had to be considered against the specific indications of Parliament’s change of attitude with respect to fraud offences such as those with which the applicants had been charged.  
     
      
    75 For my part I believe this to have been a very significant matter indeed and could convert a sentence that might otherwise have appeared to be manifestly inadequate as against the theoretical maximum penalty to one within the range of an available sentencing discretion having regard to the practical effect of the change of view of the seriousness of such offending expressed by Parliament both in the statement contained in the Executive Memorandum and by its action in reducing the penalties for the new fraud offences. The significance is not watered down simply because the new fraud offences were different to the offences for which the applicants were to be sentenced. They were to be in the future the offences that would protect the Commonwealth’s revenue against frauds of the nature of that committed by the applicants. The Judge was bound to take the change of legislative policy into account, not simply as a matter of fairness to the applicant, but also because it maintains consistency in the way that the courts are guided in sentencing by the legislature’s view of the seriousness of the offending expressed through the maximum penalty prescribed for an offence. 
     
      
    76 I accept that, had it not been open to the Judge to take into account the change of the legislature’s policy toward fraud offences, the sentences imposed as against a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years would have been inadequate in light of the Judge’s finding that the offences fell into the worst category of their type. But it seems to me that the situation was one where the Judge was entitled to take into account that the maximum penalty prescribed was no longer an appropriate yardstick to the sentence to be imposed and had little relevance as a guide to the seriousness of the applicants’ conduct. That approach is consistent with the passage quoted from Markarian above. 
     
      
    77 In my opinion the individual sentences were within his Honour’s discretion having regard to the subjective factors taken into account by him and in light of the penalty tax paid by the applicants. 
     
      
       
      Level of accumulation 
      
    78 The Crown argued that, because the individual sentences were so low, it was not open to the Judge to make them partially concurrent. It was submitted that a total sentence of eight and a half years was manifestly inadequate as against the statutory maximum of 20 years. 
     
      
    79 As I have already indicated, I believe that the Crown submission oversimplifies the situation in which the Judge found himself because the maximum penalty was not a reliable guide to the legislature’s view of the seriousness of the offending and did not have the relevance it might have had but for the change in legislative policy to this type of crime. The overall sentence imposed was in my opinion within the Judge’s legitimate discretion in the unusual circumstances of this particular sentencing exercise. 
     
      
    80 I would dismiss the Crown’s appeal. 
     
      
       
       
      
    81 The orders I propose are as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal granted but the appeal is dismissed. 
       
      2. The Crown appeal is dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HODGSON JA: In February and March 2003, the appellant was tried before Graham DCJ and a jury in two separate trials, one concerning charges of sexual offences against J (a boy) and the other concerning charges of sexual offences against F (a girl).  
     
      
    2 The trial involving J was on an indictment containing eight counts, relating to three separate incidents, each said to have occurred at Vaucluse in the State of New South Wales. 
     
      
    3 The first two counts related to an incident alleged to have occurred between 27 June 1986 and 27 June 1989, and were in identical terms, alleging assault of J and commission of an act of indecency upon him. 
     
      
    4 The next four counts related to an incident alleged to have occurred between 27 June 1988 and 31 December 1990, and alleged that the appellant had sexual intercourse with J. Counts 3 and 5 were in identical terms, alleging that J was then under the age of 10 years. Counts 4 and 6 were also in identical terms and were respectively alleged as alternatives to counts 3 and 5, and they alleged that J was then of or above the age of 10 years and below the age 16 years.  
     
      
    5 The final two counts related to an incident alleged to have occurred between 27 June 1989 and 27 June 1992, and were in identical terms, alleging that the appellant had sexual intercourse with J, a person then of or above the age of 10 years and below the age of 16 years. 
     
      
    6 On 6 March 2003, the jury in that trial returned verdicts of not guilty to counts 1, 2, 3 and 5 and guilty to counts 4, 6, 7 and 8.  
     
      
    7 The trial involving F was on an indictment containing three counts, relating to two incidents each said to have occurred at Vaucluse between 1 January 1987 and 3 October 1990.  
     
      
    8 The first two counts were in identical terms, and alleged that the appellant had sexual intercourse with F, a person then under the age of 10 years. The third count alleged that the appellant committed an act of indecency with F, a person then under the age of 16 years. 
     
      
    9 On 17 March 2003, the jury in that trial returned verdicts of guilty to all three counts.  
     
      
    10 On 25 July 2003, Graham DCJ sentenced the appellant in relation to all the offences.  
     
      
    11 In relation to the offences committed upon J, the appellant was sentenced on each count to imprisonment for five years to commence 6 March 2003 and expire 5 March 2008, in each case with a non-parole period to commence on 6 March 2003 and expire on 5 March 2006.  
     
      
    12 In relation to offences committed upon F, the appellant was sentenced on each of counts 1 and 2 to imprisonment for eight years to commence on 6 March 2003 and expire on 5 March 2011, in each case with a non-parole period to commence on 6 March 2003 and expire on 5 September 2008. On count 3, the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of 15 months, to commence on 6 March 2003 and expire on 5 June 2004.  
     
      
    13 The effect of these orders was that all sentences were to be served concurrently. The overall sentence was for eight years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of five and a half years.  
     
      
    14 The appellant appeals from his convictions. The Crown appeals on sentence. I will refer to the prisoner as the appellant or the prisoner throughout the judgment. 
     
      
       
      CROWN CASE CONCERNING J 
      
    15 J was born on 27 June 1979 at Penrith. Shortly afterwards, his parents separated, and J moved with his mother and four siblings to his maternal uncle’s residence at Watsons Bay. J’s mother met the appellant, and in about the mid-1980s they began a romantic relationship. J’s evidence was that, from the age of about 8 years, J would stay with his mother overnight at the appellant’s then residence at Vaucluse most weekends, and all incidents were alleged to have occurred there. 
     
      
    16 J’s evidence concerning the first incident (counts 1 and 2) was that J was called into the appellant’s lounge-room, and the appellant had J sit on his lap. The appellant undid his own pants, and pulled out his penis, and then reached into J’s pyjamas and started fondling J’s penis (count 1), saying “I’ll play with yours, you play with mine”. The appellant then placed J’s hands on his penis (count 2). The activity stopped when J’s mother entered the room. 
     
      
    17 J’s evidence concerning the second incident (counts 3-6) was that, when he was about 9 years of age, he was woken from his sleep in the spare room in the appellant’s house by his mother, and was taken into the appellant’s bedroom. The appellant was naked on his bed. The appellant’s mother removed the robe she was wearing, undressed J and laid him on his back. The appellant sucked J’s penis (counts 3 and 4) while J’s mother kissed J using her tongue. Then J’s mother told J he had to “return the favour” and pushed J’s head towards the appellant’s penis, and J started sucking the appellant’s penis (counts 5 and 6). J noticed that the appellant had eczema on his stomach and chest.  
     
      
    18 J’s evidence concerning the third incident (counts 7 and 8) was that when he was between the ages of 9 and 10, his mother took J into the appellant’s room where the appellant was lying on the bed. J’s mother took J’s clothes off, and laid J on the bed. The appellant then sucked J’s penis (count 7). J’s mother kissed J and guided his head towards the appellant’s penis, and J sucked it (count 8). After that incident, J’s mother told him to be quiet and go back to his room and go to bed.  
     
      
    19 J gave evidence that there were other times sexual things happened between himself and the appellant, but he was not able to give details because his memory was vague.  
     
      
    20 J gave evidence that when he was about 10 years old he spoke to his older brother D at Watson’s Bay Pizzeria, on an occasion when J’s father, mother and siblings and also the appellant were there. J said he called D to an area where there were video games, D asked him what was wrong, and J said he was “getting sexually assaulted by Mum and Ken”. D said he would tell their father, J told D he did not want D to do this, and then told him that what he had said was not true. J’s evidence was that he did this (retracted his complaint) because he knew his father had a violent temper and because he was scared that if D spoke to his mother or the appellant, something could have happened to him. 
     
      
    21 J also gave evidence that he did not tell anyone of the assaults immediately after they happened because the appellant was a violent man, J was scared of him, and J had seen the appellant hit his mother on several occasions.  
     
      
    22 D gave evidence that one day when he was at Watson’s Bay Pizzeria with his family, he and J were at the counter and J told him that the appellant had been “touching him and stuff”. D’s evidence was that he asked J if he was sure, that J walked out and then came back in and said “I didn’t mean it”, and that J was like a frightened little kid. 
     
      
    23 J’s mother gave evidence in chief of two incidents. In one, J had come to her bed, and she had fallen asleep and then woken up and found the appellant on top of J. The appellant was naked and she thought J did not have any clothes on. In the other, she saw an act of fellatio between J and the appellant, but could not remember which of them was performing the act. 
     
      
    24 The Crown Prosecutor applied for leave to cross-examine J’s mother and this was granted. He put to her that the specific incidents alleged by J had occurred; and she said “That is quite possible. I’d say it would be correct”.  
     
      
       
      CROWN CASE CONCERNING F 
      
    25 F was born on 4 October 1980. She gave similar evidence to J as to the circumstances of her acquaintance with the appellant.  
     
      
    26 F’s evidence concerning the first incident was that when she was about 6 or 7, she awoke in the appellant’s study to see her mother performing an act of fellatio on the appellant. F’s mother told her to do to the appellant what she had been doing, and F was forced to suck the appellant’s penis (count 1). F then went to the lounge, and the appellant positioned himself on top of her and inserted his penis in her vagina (count 2). F’s mother told her to stop crying and shut up, because she (F’s mother) knew F was enjoying this act.  
     
      
    27 F’s evidence concerning the second incident was that in the same year, 1987, F woke up in the appellant’s lounge-room and saw a pornographic video being played on the television. The appellant and F’s mother were on a blanket in front of the heater. The appellant and F’s mother told F to come down to them. The appellant and F’s mother, and also F, were unclothed. F touched the appellant’s penis (count 3), and F’s mother performed an act of cunnilingus on her.  
     
      
    28 F did not remember any other incidents of a sexual nature involving the appellant, but remembered she would “always” find herself waking up in the appellant’s bed with her mother, in circumstances where F had no clothes on.  
     
      
    29 F gave evidence of assaults committed by the appellant on her mother, and that the fighting made her feel scared. She did not complain to anyone after the incidents, because she did not believe it to be wrong, nobody had told her anything bad had happened, she was only a kid, she had never heard anything of sexual abuse before, and she was afraid that if she said anything to her mother she would hit her, or if anything was said to the appellant he might get angry and then instead of being violent on her mother be violent on “us kids”.  
     
      
    30 F gave evidence in chief that when she was about 14, she ran away from her mother (F and her mother were then living in the Blue Mountains) and went to stay with the appellant and her elder brother A for two weeks; and also that when she was about 16 or 17, she wrote a letter of thanks to the appellant for letting her stay at his place and thanking him “for all the nice things”. 
     
      
    31 F’s mother gave evidence of an occasion when she saw F in the appellant’s study and saw the appellant sitting on the back of F’s legs just below her buttocks. She denied ever having licked F’s vagina. She said that she had been assaulted by the appellant. 
     
      
    32 The Crown Prosecutor applied for and was given leave to cross-examine F’s mother. The first incident was put to the mother and she said that it “could have been quite possible”. The second incident was put to her mother, and she said “That’s correct” and “As far as I know that’s correct yes”, though she did not admit that she licked F’s vagina. 
     
      
    33 Over objection, the Crown adduced evidence from F that, when she was in Year 7 at Dover Heights High School, she had complained to a friend K, though she did not remember the details of the complaint. K gave evidence that in 1993 or 1994, she had a conversation with F in which she vaguely remembered F saying “Something about her mother asking her and Ken or Ken to touch her or play with her”, with F crying quite a bit, being very distraught. 
     
      
       
      DEFENCE CASE 
      
    34 The appellant gave evidence at both trials that the incidents of sexual assaults never happened, and that at no time did either complainant sleep at his place overnight when he was present. He denied ever having assaulted the complainant’s mother, and said he had been assaulted by her. He denied he ever suffered from eczema between 1988 and 1992, and tendered a photograph taken in 1988 or 1989 showing him with no shirt on.  
     
      
    35 In relation to the trial concerning F, the defence case was that the first incident could not have happened, because at the committal proceedings F had given evidence that the first incident occurred before a meeting with DOCS on 9 February 1987; and evidence was given at the trial by Dr. Roche that he had conducted a medical examination on F on 13 March 1987 which include a genital examination, and the findings were normal and F could not have been penetrated by an adult penis. F said at the trial that, when she gave evidence at the committal, she was confused as to whether she remembered the 1987 meeting with DOCS or had a memory of another meeting in 1991.  
     
      
    36 The appellant’s case was that the second incident concerning F could not have happened, because F’s mother denied cunnilingus, and because at the committal proceedings F gave evidence that during the second incident she had sucked the appellant’s penis, but conceded at the trial that this was a false memory. 
     
      
       
      GROUNDS OF APPEAL 
      
    37 The appellant relies on two grounds: 
     
      
      1. The trial judge erred in allowing evidence as to alleged physical assaults committed by the appellant upon the complaints’ mother. 
       
      2. The trial judge erred in admitting evidence of complaint in the trial with respect to the complainant [F]. 
       
       
      EVIDENCE OF ASSAULTS 
      
    38 Mr. Pontello for the appellant submitted that evidence, admitted over objection in both trials, of assaults allegedly committed by the appellant on the complaints’ mother should not have been admitted. It was not admissible as relationship or context evidence, because it was too vague, general and unspecific: R v. Marsh [2000] NSWCCA 370 at [18]. It did not assist in understanding the circumstances of the alleged assaults, since it was no part of the Crown case that compliance was due to fear of the appellant.  
     
      
    39 Mr. Pontello submitted it was not admissible to explain delay in respect of complaint. There was no effective delay in respect of complaint by J. The probative value in each case was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice: Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) s.137. The probative value was low: there was no close temporal connection between the alleged assaults and the incidents, the assaults were not committed on the complainants, the evidence was vague, there was no delay to explain in relation to J, and the assaults were of minimal relevance to the explanation of lack of complaint given by F. The danger of prejudice was high: high generality, which gave rise in cross-examination to highly prejudicial and non-responsive evidence in J’s trial from his mother that the appellant broke her back, broke her arm and bashed her head twice along pavers, with the further result that there was no effective cross-examination of the mother about the alleged assaults in F’s trial.  
     
      
    40 In my opinion, the evidence was relevant both to the acquiescence of each complainant at the time of the alleged offences, and to questions concerning complaint, although the probative value on the first aspect was small, because in each case the complainants’ evidence was essentially that they acquiesced in the relevant conduct because of directions coming from the mother, so that fear of the appellant was only of slight relevance.  
     
      
    41 On the matter of complaint, it was relevant in the case of J to the fact that the only complaint was made to his brother and then promptly withdrawn. Two explanations were given for withdrawal, one concerning what the father would do, but the other to the effect that if the brother spoke to the mother or the appellant, something could have happened to him.  
     
      
    42 In the case of F, the evidence was relevant to lack of complaint until about six years later, when complaint was made to K. F’s fear that the appellant might get angry and be violent to “us kids” was a significant part of F’s explanation for this.  
     
      
    43 On the matter of prejudice, the prejudicial and non-responsive answer by the mother could not amount to an error of the primary judge, and no complaint was made either to the primary judge or on appeal as to what was done by the primary judge in response to this. There was no application to strike out the evidence or to discharge the jury, and no complaint made about directions or lack of directions on the matter. There is no appeal ground on the basis that this unresponsive answer has resulted in a miscarriage. In my opinion, this does not go to the s.137 question. 
     
      
    44 In my opinion, there was an element of discretion to be exercised by the Crown Prosecutor and the primary judge concerning the level of generality at which this evidence was led. If such evidence is led at a high level of generality, there is difficulty in the appellant answering it. On the other hand, if it is led with too much specific detail, the evidence could be distracting from the real issues in the case. The question under s.137 is also a matter of judgment, where there would be appellate interference only if some error of principle is disclosed in the judge’s approach to the problem or if the appeal court is able to say that the trial judge’s conclusion was wrong. In my opinion, no ground is made out in this case for intervention by an appeal court on these matters. 
     
      
       
      COMPLAINT BY F 
      
    45 There was evidence from F of her complaint to K, and evidence from K of this complaint, admitted after F had been cross-examined in respect of her evidence that she stayed with the appellant for two weeks when she was about 14, and wrote a letter of thanks to him when she was about 16 or 17. In that cross-examination, it was suggested to her that there were a number of other places she could have gone to, and that she went to stay at the appellant’s house because “nothing happened”; and that she had written the letter because “nothing happened”. The trial judge then ruled that the evidence of complaint was admissible under s.108(3)(a) of the Evidence Act. Section 108 of the Act is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        108 Exception: re-establishing credibility 
         
        (1) The credibility rule does not apply to evidence adduced in re-examination of a witness. 
         
        (2) (Repealed)  
         
        (3) The credibility rule does not apply to evidence of a prior consistent statement of a witness if:  
         
        (a) evidence of a prior inconsistent statement of the witness has been admitted, or 
         
        (b) it is or will be suggested (either expressly or by implication) that evidence given by the witness has been fabricated or re-constructed (whether deliberately or otherwise) or is the result of a suggestion, 
         
        and the court gives leave to adduce the evidence of the prior consistent statement. 
        
       
      
    46 The trial judge indicated that he would allow further cross-examination of F, but the appellant’s Counsel did not undertake this.  
     
      
    47 Mr. Pontello submitted that the trial judge erred in admitting the evidence, because the evidence of complaint had no ability to answer the attack that was made on F’s credibility, and leave should not have been granted in circumstances where the Crown itself adduced evidence of the alleged prior inconsistent statements in evidence in chief. In the present case, the relevant attack on F’s credibility centred on her assertion that she went to stay with the appellant because she did not know where to go; and her vague evidence about a complaint to K did nothing to rebut this attack: R v. BD (1997) 94 A Crim R 131 at 141; Graham v. The Queen (1998) 195 CLR 606. It was not appropriate for the Crown to adduce evidence of prior inconsistent statements in evidence in chief, and then rely on this to ground an application under s.108(3)(a), particularly where the defence had not raised that issued: Gipp v. The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 106 at [12]. Complaint evidence is a powerful factor in cases such as the present, and admission of this otherwise inadmissible complaint dealt the appellant’s case an unfair blow.  
     
      
    48 Mr. Pontello also relied on s.192 of the Evidence Act, which is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        192 Leave, permission or direction may be given on terms 
         
        (1) If, because of this Act, a court may give any leave, permission or direction, the leave, permission or direction may be given on such terms as the court thinks fit. 
         
        (2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to give the leave, permission or direction, it is to take into account:  
         
        (a) the extent to which to do so would be likely to add unduly to, or to shorten, the length of the hearing, and 
         
        (b) the extent to which to do so would be unfair to a party or to a witness, and 
         
        (c) the importance of the evidence in relation to which the leave, permission or direction is sought, and 
         
        (d) the nature of the proceeding, and 
         
        (e) the power (if any) of the court to adjourn the hearing or to make another order or to give a direction in relation to the evidence. 
        
       
      
    49 He submitted that s.192(2)(b) was particularly relevant, and was not referred to by the trial judge: Stanoevski v. The Queen (2001) 202 CLR 115.  
     
      
    50 In relation to this submission, further provisions of the Evidence Act are relevant, namely the definitions in Part 1 of the Dictionary to the Evidence Act of “prior consistent statement”, “prior inconsistent statement”, “previous representation” and “representation”. Those definitions are as follows. 
     
      
       
        
        prior consistent statement 
         of a witness means a previous representation that is consistent with evidence given by the witness. 
         
         
        prior inconsistent statement 
         of a witness means a previous representation that is inconsistent with evidence given by the witness. 
         
         
        previous representation 
         means a representation made otherwise than in the course of giving evidence in the proceeding in which evidence of the representation is sought to be adduced. 
         
         
        representation 
         includes:  
         
        (a) an express or implied representation (whether oral or in writing), or 
         
        (b) a representation to be inferred from conduct, or 
         
        (c) a representation not intended by its maker to be communicated to or seen by another person, or 
         
        (d) a representation that for any reason is not communicated. 
        
       
      
    51 It is important to note that a representation can be “implied” or “inferred from conduct”; and that it is not necessary that it be intended to be asserted, as is the case in the statement of the hearsay rule in s.59(1) of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    52 In my opinion, the action of F in voluntarily going to stay for two weeks in the appellant’s house when she was 14 could be considered as an assertion or representation by conduct that the appellant had not done anything to her so terrible as she now alleged, particularly in relation to count 2. The letter of F thanking the appellant for nice things he had done amounted to an implied representation that the appellant had not treated F as she alleged, again particularly in relation to count 2.  
     
      
    53 The defence in cross-examination squarely put to F, in relation to each matter, that F did it because “nothing happened”, plainly meaning that the alleged incidents had not taken place. That was the relevant attack on F’s credibility, not the particular attack on her assertion, in relation to the first matter, that she had nowhere else to go.  
     
      
    54 In my opinion, evidence of the complaint to K made in about 1993 or 1994, shortly before the stay with the appellant and two to three years before she wrote the letter, was relevant to assist her credibility to the extent that it had been damaged by the implied representations. At least indirectly, it gave material support to her explanation of these matters, making her essential evidence concerning the incidents more credible.  
     
      
    55 In my opinion, it is appropriate for the Crown to lead relevant evidence which is damaging to the Crown case, including evidence of prior inconsistent statements by a witness. In cases such as the present, this may lay the ground for seeking leave under s.108(3)(a) to adduce evidence of a prior consistent statement; but the circumstance that the evidence was volunteered by the Crown may lead the judge, in considering whether leave should be granted, to decide that the prior inconsistent statement volunteered by the Crown is insufficient to justify admission of a complaint, which otherwise would be too late to be admissible under s.66 of the Evidence Act as having been made when the matter asserted was “fresh in the memory” of the complainant. 
     
      
    56 In this case, there was no application for such leave by the Crown prior to cross-examination, and it is not necessary to decide whether such an application could possibly have been successful. However, it does seem to me that, if it had not been suggested in cross-examination that these matters indicated that the events alleged by F had not occurred, an application by the Crown to adduce the evidence of the complaint would have been unlikely, and it would have been most unlikely to succeed. 
     
      
    57 However, the defence cross-examination of F did seek in effect to use these matters in their capacity as prior inconsistent statements, and as a basis for suggesting that F’s evidence of the alleged events was false; and it was in those circumstances that the application was made. The trial judge concluded his reasons for admitting the evidence as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        The onus is on the Crown to establish that it should be granted leave but, provided the accused has a further opportunity to cross-examine on that material, it seems to me that there is no injustice done by the admission of the material relating to the conversations with [K] in about 1993 and I grant that leave. 
        
       
      
    58 This passage, and the judgment generally, shows that the trial judge did consider the extent to which the grant of leave would be unfair to the appellant, and in my opinion the absence of specific reference to s.192 does not amount to an error: R v. Reardon [2002] NSWCCA 203 at [23]-[32].  
     
      
    59 In my opinion, the admission of the evidence, by leave of the trial judge, was justified by s.108(3)(a) of the Evidence Act; and no error has been shown in the judge’s reasons for granting that leave. 
     
      
       
      CONCLUSIONS ON CONVICTION APPEAL 
      
    60 For those reasons, the appeal against conviction fails.  
     
      
    61 I note that the Crown also sought to rely on the proviso in relation to the evidence of complaint to K. In my opinion, had the appellant established that it was wrong to admit that evidence, this would not have been a case for application of the proviso. Although the complaint evidence was vague, it could not be said that there was no reasonable possibility of a different result if that evidence had not been admitted. 
     
      
       
      CROWN APPEAL ON SENTENCE 
      
    62 It was submitted for the Crown that the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate, and that error was shown by the sentencing judge’s failure to impose appropriate individual sentences for each count, failure to accumulate individual sentences so as to reflect total criminality, and failure to provide reasons for not setting a non-parole period for count 3 in the matter of F. The effective sentence imposed on the co-offender mother of the complainants (on appeal in R V. JMP [2003] NSWCCA 369) of eight years after a 30% discount gave a notional starting point of 12 years (mathematically, it seems to me that 11½ years would be more accurate). That would also be an appropriate starting point for the prisoner. The Crown submitted that the sentencing judge had not complied with Pearce v. The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610, and that there should have been at least some partial accumulation of sentences: R v. AEM Snr, KEM & MM [2002] NSWCCA 58. Even if the alternate approach countenanced in Johnson v. The Queen (2004) 205 ALR 346 at [26] were adopted, there was still manifest inadequacy in the total.  
     
      
    63 In my opinion, the failure to provide reasons for not setting a non-parole period for count 3 could not possibly justify appellate intervention. In circumstances where the head sentence was much shorter than the non-parole periods in relation to the other offences, the reason for taking this course was manifest. Appellate intervention could not be justified. 
     
      
    64 In my opinion also, having regard to the comments of the High Court in Johnson, the circumstance that the sentencing judge did not strictly follow the Pearce procedure would not of itself be a sufficient ground for intervention on a Crown appeal in this case.  
     
      
    65 Further, in my opinion it would be inappropriate to intervene on parity grounds when the Court of Criminal Appeal in JMP applied parity with the original sentence imposed on the prisoner to reach its result in that case. The difference between a notional starting point of 11½ years in that case and the head sentence of eight years in the present case can be justified by the larger number of offences for which the mother was charged (resulting in a liability to imprisonment for a total of 110 years in her case, as against 74 years in the appellant’s case), the mother’s position of trust with respect to her children the complainants, and also perhaps some discount for the appellant because of his health. Considerations of the need for protective custody could also be relevant, although those considerations could apply equally in both cases.  
     
      
    66 Accordingly, in my opinion the real issue on this appeal is the matter of manifest inadequacy. In my opinion, the sentence imposed was too low having regard to the very high criminality involved; and were the role of this Court simply to impose the sentence that it thought appropriate, in my opinion the result would be a substantial increase in the sentence. However, having regard to all the considerations that apply in the case of Crown appeals, and having regard to the circumstance that to disturb the current sentence could disturb what the Court of Criminal Appeal in JMP considered appropriate having regard to parity considerations, in my opinion the Court should not intervene in this case. 
     
      
       
      CONCLUSION 
      
    67 For those reasons, in my opinion the following orders should be made: 
     
      
      1. Conviction appeal dismissed. 
       
      2. Crown appeal on sentence dismissed. 
       
      
    68 HULME J: I agree with the orders proposed by Hodgson JA and with his Honour’s reasons. 
     
      
    69 HIDDEN J: I agree with Hodgson JA.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HOWIE J: On 29 August 2002 the applicant was arraigned in the District Court on an indictment containing three counts. The first alleged an offence of break enter and steal in circumstances of aggravation contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act. The second alleged an offence of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm contrary to s 35(1)(b) of that Act. The third count was in the alternative to the second and alleged an offence of malicious wounding contrary to s 35(1)(a) of that Act. The applicant pleaded guilty to the first and third counts on the indictment. Those pleas were accepted by the Crown in full satisfaction of the indictment and the applicant was remanded for sentence. 
     
      
    2 When the applicant came before her Honour Judge Morgan to be sentenced for the offences to which he had pleaded guilty, he asked her Honour to take into account five offences on a Form 1 when sentencing him in respect of the first count in the indictment. In respect of the offence of malicious wounding her Honour sentenced the applicant to a fixed term of 2 years imprisonment to commence on 24 February 2002 and to expire on 23 February 2004. In respect of the offence in the first count and taking into account the matters on the Form 1, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years and 6 months to commence on 24 February 2004 and to expire on 23 August 2008. In respect of this sentence her Honour fixed a non-parole period of 2 years to expire on 23 February 2006. The sentence therefore imposed upon the applicant totalled 6 years 6 months with an effective minimum period of imprisonment of 4 years. 
     
      
    3 Three grounds of appeal have been filed in respect of the application and are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The learned sentencing judge erred in law as to the appropriate approach to the issues of totality and application of principles promulgated in  
        Pearce v The Queen 
         194 CLR 610. 
         
         
        2 The learned sentencing judge failed to adequately reflect relevant features of the applicant’s background, in particular those arising for consideration pursuant to  
        R v Fernando 
         (1992) 76 A Crim R 58. 
         
         
        3. The sentences imposed manifestly exceed those that were required to meet the combination of objective criminality and subjective factors to be considered in the sentencing synthesis. 
        
       
      
    4 The two offences to which the applicant pleaded guilty are related and both occurred on 24 February 2002. The first count alleged that he broke and entered the dwelling house of Joseph Frendo and there committed a serious indictable offence in that he stole a television set in circumstances of aggravation namely that at the time when he entered the dwelling house he knew that there were persons present there. This is an offence that carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. The second offence to which the applicant pleaded guilty arose in the aftermath of that offence when the applicant inflicted a wound to the face of Mr Frendo. It is an offence that carries a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    5 The matters on the Form1 arose from two separate incidents of criminality. The first occurred on 23 November 2001 when the applicant broke and entered a public school and stole computer equipment. After he was arrested in respect of that matter he was found to be in possession of a screwdriver and a claw hammer. The second group of matters were committed on 20 December 2001 and might be described as street offences arising from a brawl in which the applicant became involved. They were not of such seriousness in themselves that they need to be further identified but one allegation was that he was threatening a person with a golf club. It should be noted that the applicant was on bail in respect of the matters set out in the Form 1 when he committed the offences to which he pleaded guilty. 
     
      
    6 There is no real dispute about the facts upon which the learned sentencing judge was entitled to determine the appropriate sentences to be imposed upon the applicant. They were set out in a fact sheet prepared by the Crown Prosecutor and which was admitted by consent. For present purposes they can be summarised as follows. 
     
      
    7 At about midnight on 24 February 2002 Mr Frendo and his wife had retired to bed for the night when they heard the voice of the applicant, whom they knew, outside the bedroom window asking Mr Frendo whether he had any cigarettes. Mr Frendo replied that he did not and reminded the applicant of the time. As the applicant walked away from the house, he was heard to say, “This would be an easy house to break into because it was all open.” 
     
      
    8 At about 4 am that morning Mr Frendo’s son heard a noise and got out of bed to investigate. He saw the applicant and another person walk out of the house carrying a television set, which the applicant placed on the ground outside. The child then woke his mother and told her what he had seen and she in turn woke Mr Frendo. The three left their home to look for the applicant and saw him walking with another male a short distance away. The applicant became aware of the presence of Mr Frendo and his wife and returned to where they were standing. Some words were exchanged between the applicant and Mr Frendo. The applicant ran a short distance to obtain a wooden stake with which he armed himself. He pursued the fleeing Mr Frendo back towards the front of his home. A struggle there ensued during which the applicant obtained a length of pipe, broke it and thrust the end into the left side of Mr Frendo’s face causing a laceration to his lower left eyelid. By this time the police had been called and when they arrived the applicant was still in possession of the pipe. The applicant was arrested and police found that he had entered the home through a window having first removed the flyscreen. 
     
      
    9 As a result of the attack upon him Mr Frendo suffered a fracture of the medial wall of the eye socket as well as the laceration. It appears that he had some childhood trauma to that eye that had resulted in it being turned slightly prior to the attack upon him by the applicant. Although there were some complications in the treatment of the wound inflicted in the offence because it became infected, it is expected that Mr Frendo will fully recover from these injuries. A victim impact statement placed before the sentencing judge indicated the severity of the effect upon him and his family of the offences committed by the applicant and the deterioration in their enjoyment of life as a result. 
     
      
    10 The applicant, who was aged 20 years at the time of being sentenced, gave evidence before Judge Morgan. He explained the offence was committed because he needed money to buy cigarettes after Mr Frendo refused to give him any. He said that he had been drinking vodka prior to the offence and only remembered bits and pieces of what happened. He had been in custody since his arrest and had been undertaking courses in an attempt to overcome his abuse of alcohol. A number of certificates gained by the applicant from courses conducted in gaol were before her Honour. The applicant said that he was blind in the left eye as a result of an attack upon him and deaf in the right ear as a result of a fight. He also suffered from epilepsy. He explained that his use of alcohol prior to the offences arose from emotional upset as a result of hearing about a life-threatening illness to his child and the death of a friend. He said that he had been using alcohol since the age of fifteen. A letter written by the applicant was tendered to the court in which he expressed sorrow at the effect of his offences on his mother. When he was shown a picture of the injury he inflicted upon Mr Frendo, the applicant said, “I done a very bad job”. 
     
      
    11 The applicant has some criminal record with appearances in the Childrens Court from 1997 when he received a control order for an offence of break enter and steal. In March 1999 he was placed on a bond for an assault and using offensive language. In August 1999 he was fined for two offences of assaulting an officer in the execution of his duty. A pre-sentence report indicated that the applicant’s formative years had been marked by violence by his father toward his mother when under the influence of alcohol. He had been placed under care by the Department of Community Services on several occasions since the age of ten. His schooling was limited as a result of expulsions and truancy. He is barely literate. The applicant had a son as a result of relationship but the child died at the age of 6 weeks in early 2002. This had a detrimental effect upon him and brought the relationship to an end. 
     
      
    12 The applicant’s position was summarised in the report as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “[The applicant] appears to have [ ] spent his formative years in and out of foster care placements and appears to have been exposed to domestic violence and alcohol abuse from an early age. Due to this the offender has poorly developed coping skills and tends to inappropriately deal with conflict and stress, which tends to result in the offender coming into contact with lawful (sic) enforcement. 
         
         
        While he appears to acknowledge that he has issues in dealing with anger he appears to minimise the extent to which it has adversely affected his life. He states that he can “control” his anger and that other people torment him. He displays an immature attitude to his current situation.” 
        
       
       
      The officer believed that the applicant would benefit from counselling to assist in controlling his use of alcohol and anger management. 
       
      
    13 In determining the appropriate sentence to impose upon the applicant, the sentencing judge indicated that she would give him the full discount for his pleas of guilty which, she accepted, were given at the earliest opportunity. Her Honour did not find that the applicant was genuinely remorseful for the injury he inflicted upon the victim. 
     
      
    14 The first ground of appeal asserts that her Honour was in error in applying the principle enunciated in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 in relation to sentencing for multiple offences. In passing sentence, Judge Morgan said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I think that these are such serious matters, that the only penalty that can be imposed is one of full time custody. I have determined the appropriate sentence for each offence in accordance with the principles of the High Court Case of Pearce, and having regard to the principles of totality, I think that a sentence is required of a total of six and a half years and those sentences will be structured in the following way:….. 
        
       
       
      Her Honour then went on to impose the sentences I indicated earlier in this judgment being a fixed term of two years for the malicious wounding and a cumulative sentence of four and a half years for the offence in the first count with a non-parole period of two years in respect of that offence. 
       
      
    15 The error attributed to her Honour is that she determined the total sentence first and then structured the sentences for the two offences within that sentence. It was submitted that what her Honour should have done was firstly to determine each sentence appropriate for the two offences independently, secondly to have assessed the totality of the criminality represented by the offences and thirdly to have determined the degree of concurrence or cumulation of those sentences in order to reflect her assessment of the total criminality. 
     
      
    16 I do not believe that the criticism is justified. I do not understand why her Honour should not be taken at her word; being that she determined the appropriate sentence for each offence and then determined the total sentence to be imposed having regard to the principle of totality. The fact that she announced what the total sentence would be before indicating how the individual sentences should be structured is not in conflict with the way that her Honour said she had determined the sentences. Pearce contains no prohibition on indicating what the total sentence should be before indicating how the individual sentences are to be structured. There is no reason not to assume that before her Honour embarked upon her sentencing remarks she would have determined what the sentence was to be both as to its individual parts and as to its total length. 
     
      
    17 Nor does the fact that the sentences were made wholly cumulative indicate an erroneous approach. Although the malicious wounding occurred as a result of the commission of the offence in the first count in the indictment, it was a completely separate and independent act of criminality. The applicant returned to confront Mr Frendo. He armed himself and chased him as he sought refuge in his home. He picked up the piece of pipe, broke it, and deliberately used it to wound Mr Frendo to the face. The determination of whether a sentence should be made cumulative in whole or part is a matter of sentencing discretion Hammoud (2000) 118 A Crim R 66 at [7]. There was no error in the approach her Honour took in structuring the sentence as she did. 
     
      
    18 The applicant is however on firmer ground in submitting that the overall sentence determined by her Honour as reflecting the criminality before her, and in particular the sentence imposed for the offence in the first count, was manifestly excessive. Her Honour indicated that she was giving the maximum discount for the utilitarian effect of the pleas of guilty: that would be twenty-five per cent. Her Honour, therefore, must have determined that the overall criminality before discount would have warranted a sentence of eight years and eight months. Notwithstanding the serious criminal conduct before her and the need for a deterrent sentence, I respectfully have formed the view that a sentence of that magnitude was not warranted. I am not persuaded, however, that this was because her Honour failed to have due regard to the applicant’s aboriginality as the applicant asserts. Her Honour referred to this factor during the course of her remarks and the relevance that it had in respect of the applicant’s early exposure to violence and alcohol. 
     
      
    19 As with all appeals based upon a ground where no specific error is identified, the Court should be careful not to attribute error simply because the Court would have imposed a lesser sentence than did the sentencing judge. Genuine respect has to be paid to the discretion residing in the sentencing judge, particularly where the judge is as experienced in the criminal law as is the judge against whom this appeal has been brought. But a ground based upon an allegation that the sentence is manifestly excessive can only be determined by a subjective reaction to the sentence imposed having regard to what statistical material might be available as to other sentences imposed for similar criminality. In the present case the material from the Judicial Commission is of limited assistance but indicates that the individual sentences imposed were towards the top of the range. 
     
      
    20 I note that the applicant was on bail when he committed the subject offence and that the Form 1 contains another serious example of an offence against property. The sentence imposed by her Honour had to reflect the further weight to be attributed to personal deterrence and retribution by reason of the offences taken into account, Attorney General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518 at [42]. But one limit upon the effect to be given to such matters is the principle of totality. 
     
      
    21 The offence for which sentence was to be imposed was a serious one in its nature, being an aggravated offence of breaking into a private home, but it was far from the most serious kind of an offence falling within the class of offences for which a maximum sentence of 20 years is prescribed. I would have thought that it was on the lower end of criminality for offences of that class. I would not necessarily accept that such an offence is less serious simply because the offender is known by the occupants as the applicant submits, but all of the circumstances of this particular offence suggest to me that an undiscounted sentence of six years is manifestly excessive bearing in mind the fact that the sentence was to be served cumulatively with the sentence for malicious wounding and having regard to the subjective circumstances of the applicant. Of crucial importance in that regard was that he was an aboriginal man of twenty years of age serving a first sentence in an adult prison. 
     
      
    22 On the basis that the Court might find error and be required to re-exercise the sentencing discretion the Court received a recently prepared report of a psychologist, Peter Champion. From his assessment of the applicant Mr Champion believes that follow up to assist the applicant would include counselling and possibly residential placement for the applicant in relation to his use of alcohol, an ENT examination in respect of his hearing problems, a neurological appraisal, and his involvement in anger and stress management courses. The Court also received a number of inmate assessment reports that indicate that the applicant has been working well while in custody and has been attempting courses to obtain some skills that he might later put to use in the community. This confirms that the applicant is in need of, and could be assisted by, intensive intervention when released from prison. He should be provided with the opportunity for rehabilitation by a finding of special circumstances. 
     
      
    23 I propose that the application be granted and the appeal be allowed in respect of the sentence for the offence on the first count in the indictment. The sentence on that count should be quashed and in lieu the applicant be sentenced to three years imprisonment to commence on 24 February 2004 with a non-parole period of 6 months to expire on 23 August 2004 the date upon which the applicant is to be released to parole. It is to be a condition of his parole that he places himself under the supervision of the adult probation service. 
     
      
    24 TOBIAS JA: I agree with the orders proposed by Howie J for the reasons his Honour has given. 
     
      
    25 JAMES J: I also agree. 
     
      
    26 TOBIAS JA: The orders of the Court will therefore be as indicated by Howie J.

     The appellant was found guilty by a jury of knowingly taking part in the cultivation of cannabis plants, contrary to s23(2)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. He was sentenced to a minimum term of one year, ten months and five days imprisonment. The appellant appealed against both his conviction and sentence. 
      
       
     It was argued that the appellant provided assistance and/or supplies to unknown persons, with the knowledge that such equipment and supplies would be used in the furtherance of the cultivation of cannabis. The Crown's case at trial was based on the evidence given by police officers as to the existence of the crop site, the statements made by the appellant's former de facto partner and circumstantial evidence.  
      
       
     The appellant alleged that the trial Judge had erred with respect to the directions which had been given to the jury regarding the requisite knowledge of the accused as to the actual cultivation of the cannabis plants. Further, it was claimed that the trial Judge failed adequately to direct the jury that an alternative explanation for the circumstantial evidence must be excluded.  
      
       
     The appellant also relied on medical evidence in order to argue that his defence had been impaired at trial because of profound memory loss. Claims that the evidence of the appellant's former de facto partner and certain police officers was fabricated were also advanced on appeal. 
      
       
     HELD (per Sheller JA, Grove J and Simpson J concurring) 
      
       
     1. An analysis of the trial Judge's summing up did not support a finding that his directions cast the onus on the appellant to point to a reasonable explanation consistent with his innocence. There is a fine distinction to be drawn between not finding an accused guilty if there is a reasonable explanation which is consistent with his innocence and not finding the accused guilty unless there is no reasonable explanation which is consistent with innocence. 
      
       
     2. The appellant's claims about his memory loss were inconsistent with much of the evidence which he gave in chief and under cross-examination at trial. The arguments raised about the credibility of the evidence of his former de facto partner were adequately addressed by the trial Judge in his directions to the jury. The claims of fabrication of evidence and profound memory loss were both dealt with at first instance. 
      
       
     3. The appellant's challenge to the sentence imposed by his Honour failed. His claim that the trial Judge did not take into account time served on remand was irrelevant as that time was served in relation to another offence.

      REGINA v Carl Rodney SLATTERY 
      
      
       
      
      
      Judgment 
      
      
       
        
       SHELLER JA:  
        
        
       Offence charged 
        
       
     1 The appellant, Carl Rodney Slattery, was charged that between 20 December 1992 and 5 January 1994 at Colo Heights and elsewhere in the State of New South Wales he did knowingly take part in the cultivation of prohibited plants – namely, cannabis plants, the number of which was not less than the commercial quantity applicable to that prohibited plant – contrary to s23(2)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. Section 6 provided that for the purposes of the Act “a person takes part in the cultivation ….of a prohibited plant ……if - 
      
       
        
         
         (a) the person takes, or participates in, any step, or causes any step to be taken, in the process of that cultivation….” 
         
        
       
     2 The appellant pleaded not guilty and the trial began in the District Court before his Honour Judge Knight and a jury on 9 September 1998. On 6 October 1998 the jury found the appellant guilty. On 23 October 1998 the appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of four years, four months and five days commencing on that date and expiring on 27 February 2003. A minimum term of one year, ten months and five days expiring on 27 August 2000 was fixed. The appellant appealed against his conviction and sentence. 
      
       
        
       Crown case 
        
       
     3 The appellant was charged with taking part in the cultivation not only at Colo Heights (the crop site) but also at Augusta Street, Strathfield where he resided. There was no direct evidence of any person actively taking part in cultivating the plants of varying size found throughout the bush at the crop site. On 4 January 1994 in the area of the crop site the police heard a pump operating and two male voices. On 5 January 1994 the police raided the site and chased someone. The police did not see anyone at the crop site. The Crown presented its case against the appellant in two ways. First, it relied on circumstantial evidence claimed to link the appellant with the cultivation. Part of the circumstantial evidence was two thumbprints of the appellant on items found at the crop site. Second, the Crown relied on the direct evidence of Carol Duggan. She had had a de facto relationship with the appellant at the time of the alleged offence which broke up in 1996. She swore that the appellant admitted to her that he was at the cannabis plantation and on one occasion was chased out of it by helicopter. She gave evidence that the appellant told her about a glove with a hole in the position where the appellant’s thumbprint would have been.  
      
       
     4 The Crown listed the circumstantial evidence as follows: 
      
       
        
       1. The plantation site at Colo Heights was in rugged and isolated terrain difficult to get to and difficult to take things out of. There was irrigation and a flying fox. Water tanks had been constructed. There was a handmade wooden table. Whoever was involved needed knowledge of irrigation and pumps. The appellant’s talents and know-how meant he could have been one of the persons involved in the cultivation.  
        
        
       2. The appellant’s thumbprints were found on a peanut butter jar and on the inside of a hurricane lamp which were at the crop site. The Crown argued that there was a negligible chance of this occurring unless the appellant was connected with the crop site. At the time these prints were found by the police in January 1994, Carol Duggan was on good terms with the appellant and had no motive to plant them. The jar was found amongst other food items at the crop site and the print on the hurricane lamp was imprinted in soot which the Crown said must have happened at the crop site. If the lamp had been lit by anyone else at the crop site, one would have expected the thumbprint to be then covered in soot. In July 1997 the police returned to the area and found a glove with a hole in the right thumb. The appellant’s thumbprints on items at the crop site were right thumbprints. Dr Elizabeth Brown, a botanist, gave evidence of moss growing on the inside of the glove which negated any suggestion that the glove was later planted at the site. Dr Brown had never seen the type of moss growing on the glove in any Sydney metropolitan area, including Strathfield where the appellant had been with Ms Duggan at the residence in Augusta Street. The glove had been in a situation suitable for the growth of that kind of moss for not less than one year and probably much longer. The glove must have been in place with moss growing on it at an earlier time when the appellant and Ms Duggan still had a good relationship.  
        
        
       3. The twirls and criss-cross patterns on a grate found at the crop site matched with one placed over a manhole by the appellant at Augusta Street. The manufacturer of the grates gave evidence that they were exactly the same.  
        
        
       4. The garage at the Augusta Street property was the appellant’s domain. He acknowledged being in the garage tinkering around, fixing parts of lawn mowers and pumps.  
        
        
       5. A Tempest brand radio was found by the police on the table at the crop site. A witness, Luke Montague, said he last saw the radio in the garage at the Augusta Street property.  
        
        
       6. Burnt hessian at the crop site was of “generally similar” appearance to hessian found at the Augusta Street property. 
        
        
       7. Paint on the sprinkler hose bases and air filters from the green pumps found at the crop site were made of a similar colour and similar composition to paint in a can found in the Augusta Street property garage. 
        
        
       8. A freshly painted pump was found in the boot of a vehicle, in which the appellant was a passenger, by Constable Gorman. This pump was later found at the crop site. At the time the pump was found in the boot by Constable Gorman the appellant falsely told him he had picked up his girlfriend because her car had broken down. 
        
        
       9. A map of the crop site area and camouflaged clothing was found at the Augusta Street residence. 
        
        
       10. Two brackets found outside the garage were identical to the mounting bracket on the bases of two pumps found at the crop site. 
        
        
       11. Two plastic drums found at the Augusta Street residence were of the same size and shape as one found at the crop site. The base of the footings of the drums matched an imprint on the garden seat at the crop site. 
        
        
       12. The appellant admitted using glue which was the same as glue found on one of the exhibits. 
        
        
       Draft grounds of appeal 
        
       
     5 On 28 February 2002 the Registrar received a letter from Mr Scott Corish, barrister, referring to a letter that the appellant had written to the Registrar advising that he would be appearing for himself. Mr Corish had prepared submissions for the appellant based on what appear to be draft grounds of appeal and forwarded these to the Court for its assistance without seeking to limit the way in which the appellant put his case. Ground 3 was abandoned. The appellant adopted the other grounds and counsel’s submissions. 
      
       
     6 The draft grounds of appeal were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “1. The learned trial Judge erred with respect to the directions to the jury regarding the requisite knowledge of the accused of cultivation in relation to the provision of goods/equipment or comfort(s) by the accused and, in particular: 
         
        
        
         
         a. failed to adequately direct the jury’s attention to the necessity of finding of knowledge of actual cultivation, and 
         
        
        
         
         b. failed to adequately direct the jury that an alternative explanation must be excluded. 
         
        
        
         
         2. The learned trial Judge erred in directing to the jury with respect to circumstantial evidence by casting the onus on the accused to point to a reasonable explanation consistent with innocence. 
         
        
        
         
         3. The learned trial Judge erred in failing to adequately direct the jury with respect to the use of lies attributed to the accused.” 
         
        
        
       
     7 In the written submissions, Mr Corish pointed out that the Crown case was that the appellant provided assistance and/or supplies to unknown persons who were cultivating the crops, by way of supplying or repairing equipment or otherwise providing sustenance and supplies (eg the hurricane lamp or peanut butter in the jar). Allegedly this was done with the knowledge that such equipment and supplies would be used in furtherance of the cultivation of the cannabis. In summary, there were three legs to the Crown case which were: 
      
       
        
         
         (a) The evidence in relation to the crop sites given by police officers as to the existence of the cultivation. 
         
        
        
         
         (b) The evidence of [the appellant’s] former de facto partner, Carol Duggan, in relation to a conversation she had with [the appellant] at Long Bay Gaol in early 1994 to the effect that [the appellant] admitted to her that he was involved in the cultivation. 
         
        
        
         
         (c) The circumstantial evidence which categorised into nineteen points, reiterated to the jury by the trial Judge during his summing up. 
         
        
       
     8 The cannabis was first located by police in September 1993. Police visited the site on several occasions during that month (2, 6 and 29 September 1993) and then later in January 1994. Although the police stated that during the visit to the site on 4 January 1994 they heard a voice and a water pump operating and on 5 January 1994 heard a person running through the bush, no arrests were made. 
      
       
        
       Ground 1 
        
       
     9 Counsel pointed out that the Crown case was based upon the supply of the pump, the supply of other equipment and the supply of comforts. For the jury to be satisfied that it was appropriate to draw the inference that the appellant intended the equipment comforts to be used in the cultivation of cannabis, it was necessary for the trial Judge to have directed the jury that in making the connection between the supply of the equipment and the use in cultivation any other reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence had been excluded. It was necessary that the trial Judge direct the jury that the Crown had to negative the possibility that the equipment, lamp and jar were supplied to the cultivators in circumstances other than that directly involved in the cultivation. Comparison was drawn with R v Oliverio (Court of Criminal Appeal, 30 August 1989, unreported). In circumstances where there was no direct evidence of the presence of the appellant at the site, it was submitted that it was imperative the jury be instructed they must exclude the hypothesis consistent with innocence, for example that some other person obtained a jar of peanut butter, lamp and pump in entirely unrelated circumstances for their own undisclosed reasons. 
      
       
        
       Ground 2 
        
       
     10 A direction on circumstantial evidence was required. In Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573 at 586 Dawson J, with whose judgment Toohey and Gaudron JJ agreed, said: 
      
       
        
         
         “….the only proper course for the jury to adopt was to consider all the evidence together. Nor was it necessary for the jury to reach any particular intermediate conclusion of fact in making an inference of guilt on the part of the applicant, other than the obvious one, tantamount to an inference of guilt, that the applicant was engaged in a combination of the kind alleged against him. Of course, the jury could not properly have made that inference unless they were satisfied that, upon the whole of the evidence in all three categories, there was no reasonable explanation consistent with the applicant’s innocence. It was appropriate that the jury should have been given a direction in those terms and they were given one.” 
         
        
       
     11 In summing up the learned trial Judge instructed the jury as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “Once you have decided what the facts are as you find them to be, you can then decide whether the accused is guilty or not guilty but, you must not find the accused guilty if on the facts as you find them to be, there is a reasonable explanation for those facts which is consistent with his innocence. I will go over that again because it is very important. You must not find the accused guilty, if you are looking at the circumstantial evidence, unless on all the facts as you find them to be, there is no reasonable explanation which is consistent with his innocence. You have looked at the facts, you have decided what the facts are, if you think there is a reasonable explanation which is consistent with his innocence, then you must not find him guilty, you must find him not guilty.” 
         
        
        
         
        
       
     12 Emphasis was placed upon the first sentence in the passage suggesting that the jury was required to engage in an examination of the evidence to establish whether a “reasonable explanation exists” and shifting the burden to the appellant to satisfy the jury that such a reasonable explanation did exist. The verdict of guilty could only be returned when the jury were satisfied that the circumstances were inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis other than the guilt of the accused; Peacock v R (1911) 13 CLR 619 at 634. Later in the summing up the trial Judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “In relation to the circumstantial parts of the case, you must not find the accused guilty if there is another reasonable explanation for all the facts as you find them to be.” 
         
        
       
     13 It was submitted that the jury had not been disabused of the need to inquire whether the appellant had established the existence of a reasonable explanation. Later the trial Judge revisited the matter. It was submitted that the jury could only be left with the impression that it was for the appellant to establish the existence of such a reasonable explanation not for the Crown to negate it. 
      
       
     14 It was conceded that counsel at the trial, not Mr Corish, indicated that he had no complaint about the general direction in relation to circumstantial evidence. It was suggested that the subtle distinction between what was said and should have been said while important may have passed unnoticed. It was unlikely to be a consequence of any tactical decision by counsel for the appellant. 
      
       
     15 Mr Corish’s submissions did not address the core of ground 1, namely the asserted failure adequately to direct on the necessity for a finding of knowledge of actual cultivation and the absence of an alternative explanation. On these matters, in supplementary submissions, the Crown referred to various parts of the summing up where the trial Judge had stressed the elements of the offence as knowingly taking part in the cultivation (see pp 6, 7, 8 and 10 of the summing up). The learned trial Judge said: 
      
       
        
         
         “So the Crown has to prove beyond reasonable doubt that not only did Carl Rodney Slattery take part in the cultivation but that he did so with knowledge that the plants were cannabis plants and with an intention of taking part in their cultivation.” 
         
        
        
       At 60 of his summing up his Honour referred to what the appellant said. His Honour said: 
        
        
         
         “The accused’s case is a simple one. He simply says I did not know anything about this crop site. I never went there. I never knowingly gave any equipment, supplied any equipment or repaired anything to be used there. I did not provide any hurricane lamp or anything of that nature to be used there. It was a major crop plantation, yes. But it had nothing whatsoever to do with me and I was not knowingly in any way whatsoever. 
         
        
        
         
         As I have said to you, the Crown bears the onus of proving the case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. In relation to the circumstantial parts of the case, you must not find the accused guilty if there is another reasonable explanation for all of the facts as you find them to be.” 
         
        
       
     16 The Crown submitted that an analysis of the summing up did not support the claim that the directions cast the onus on the appellant to point to a reasonable explanation consistent with his innocence. It seems to me a fine distinction to draw between not finding the accused guilty if there is a reasonable explanation which is consistent with his innocence and not finding the accused guilty unless there is no reasonable explanation which is consistent with his innocence. It was a distinction which apparently passed by counsel at the trial. In my opinion, there is nothing in the point and this ground of appeal fails. 
      
       
     17 The appellant was unrepresented on his appeal and argued the matter for himself. He relied upon three affidavits made by himself on 1, 14 and 15 February 2002, on two affidavits made by Silvia Mayorca on 9 February 2001 and 19 April 2001 and an affidavit of Mathew Wilfred Faith of 15 August 2001. The first of these affidavits, the appellant’s affidavit of 1 February, covers 77 pages and contains by inclusion, annexure or reference the bulk of the material upon which he relies. In the course of short oral submissions to the Court the appellant said that the appeal would stand or fall on the medical evidence.  
      
       
     18 At the beginning of the first affidavit the appellant set out his grounds as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “1. Grave miscarriage of justice has occurred. 
         
        
        
         
         2. Fabrication of evidence by police and improper conduct. 
         
        
        
         
         3. Crown witness conducted a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. 
         
        
        
         
         4. Direction as to the prints found being circumstantial evidence. 
         
        
        
         
         5. Defence impaired by profound lost memory. 
         
        
        
         
         6. Test carried out non-specific therefore non-expert no direction to probative value. 
         
        
        
         
         7. Crown witness Carol May Duggan’s evidence tainted. 
         
        
        
         
         8. Crown witness Carol May Duggan’s evidence not included in Crown brief. 
         
        
        
         
         9. All available evidence not before the jury.” 
         
        
       
     19 He next set out what he described as the questions involved in the Colo matter claiming amongst them that there was evidence of “amnesia” not available at the time of the trial and that his medical condition caused him not to be able to recall vital evidence which was supported by a wealth of corroborating evidence. He elaborated upon a claim that the witness Carol May Duggan conducted a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice with motives for revenge and financial gain. 
      
       
     20 The questions then extended out to allegations against the police officers involved. In particular, the appellant claimed, in reliance upon the evidence of Ms Mayorca and Mr Faith, that the area of cultivation was easily discoverable and not a remote and isolated area. This was evidence based on visits to the site made in 2000 and 2001. On its face it seems to be rather beside the point. There was no issue at the trial that the site was one on which in late 1993 and January 1994 a substantial crop of cannabis was being cultivated. There was no issue that on the site were found two articles, the peanut butter jar and the lamp, which bore the appellant’s thumbprint. There was evidence that the glove with a hole in the right thumb was found some years later which might be regarded as surprising. But there was also evidence upon which the jury could be satisfied that it had been there for some years before it was found. 
      
       
        
       Loss of memory 
        
       
     21 The main thrust of the appellant’s argument related to what he described as his “profound loss of memory” at the time of the trial which robbed him of the opportunity to defend himself properly (see para 8 of his first affidavit). Perhaps more significant is the claim that at the time the appellant made the admission to the witness Duggan, he was suffering from a form of “global amnesia”. This condition was said to result from a head injury he claimed was caused by a police assault in 1991 and to have been aggravated by his coming upon the blood soaked corpse of a cellmate while he was in gaol. According to the appellant the consequences relevant to this appeal were as follows: 
      
       
        
         
         “i) The profound memory loss caused me not to be able to recall that I had served near to 8 months on remand. This was not taken into account by either judges nor was it raised during the course of both sentences. 
         
        
        
         
         ii) Not to able to recall that I had already told Carol Duggan that I was arrested for cultivation and that a print of mine was found on a peanut butter jar. I gave instructions that she was to inform my legal representatives. 
         
        
        
         
         iii) Not to be able to recall that Carol Duggan was present at the Auburn Hospital in the company of my solicitors. 
         
        
        
         
         iv) Not able to recall that my wife Janet Slattery, was told on the 16 January 1994 before the alleged admission took place, by Carol Duggan that I was arrested for cultivation and that a print was found on a peanut butter jar. 
         
        
        
         
         v) Not able to recall that I was suffering from profound memory loss at the time of the alleged admissions. 
         
        
        
         
         vi) Not able to recall that I had met Detective Henry at our home some time in 1993 and that he was introduced to me as a friend of Carol Duggan’s who was married to one of her old girl friends.” 
         
        
       
     22 The appellant claimed that he was disadvantaged at the trial because the prison records did not show that he was admitted to Prince Henry Hospital from 14 January 1994 to 23 January 1994. At the trial the appellant gave the following evidence: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Where were you in January 1994 after the day of your arrest? A. I was in the Prince Henry Hospital for 14 days. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And when you say Prince Henry Hospital, what part of Prince Henry Hospital were you in? A. It’s the prison annex of Prince Henry Hospital. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. After 14 days, where did you go then? A. I was transferred to the Remand Centre at Long Bay, the prison complex. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. And were you in custody as a result of having been refused bail? A. Yes, I was.” 
         
        
       
     23 Not long after that evidence was given the trial Judge granted the appellant leave to serve a subpoena on the proper officer of the Department of Corrective Services Sydney for the production of all records of outgoing telephone calls made by him whilst in custody at the Prince Henry annex of Long Bay Correctional Centre for the period 13 January 1994 to 10 February 1994. 
      
       
     24 It is not entirely clear from the material the appellant has submitted the period during which he was said to have suffered global amnesia, but it seems to have been during the twelve months after the alleged bashing in 1991. Doctor Swan, in her report of 17 January 1994, referred to amnesia as part of the history she was given by the appellant. She wrote: 
      
       
        
         
          “Mr Slattery gives a history of generalised amnesia for all the details of his life prior to his collapse ….. in police custody for charges of cultivation of marijuana. He states that he has no memory for personal identity and that he was unable to remember also his wife and son. The one detail he was able to remember is that he is a cigarette smoker. (The appellant) also states that he is ….. depressed.” 
         
        
       
     25 In the Prince Henry Hospital evening nursing report of 14 January 1994 appears: 
      
       
        
         
          “Admitted to Auburn Hospital following queried seizure whilst in police hospital. Patient suffering from memory loss and experiences bouts of dizziness accompanied by headaches and blackouts since December 1994 ……Patient unable to remember date or why he was admitted into hospital.” 
         
        
        
       The nursing notes for 15 January 1994 state: 
        
        
         
         “Patient states he does not know where he was before being admitted. Denies being in gaol.” 
         
        
        
       Notes of Dr Spira of that date state: 
        
        
         
         “Mr Slattery claims no memory of self or past beyond his time in Auburn Hospital yesterday. Nevertheless he has a clear recall of what has been said to him…… He seems surprised at being in gaol. …. Either a conversion reaction or malingering.” 
         
        
        
       On 18 January 1994 Dr Spira observed that the appellant had no memory and claimed not to have recognised his wife “but feels that he would do so now”. The doctor also notes some inconsistencies in history. Dr Swan, in the report from which I have already quoted, said that the features were consistent with psychogenic amnesia. 
        
       
     26 The appellant’s claims about problems with his memory which he says continued until about 1999 do not sit well with a reading of the transcript of his evidence at the trial which continued for some time. Both in chief and under cross-examination he appeared to answer questions positively and with ready recall. There is no sign that I have come upon which indicates a lapse of memory. I give a short and random example of his evidence in cross-examination relating to the occasion when he had been pulled over by police on 23 November 1993 at 5 am in the morning when driving a white Ford Falcon which appeared to be travelling in convoy with a red Toyota Hilux along the Singleton Road towards Wilberforce: 
      
       
        
         
         “Q. Did you deny knowledge of the other vehicle when police initially spoke to you? Answer, ‘Yes’. Was that answer of yours to the police, true? A. That I denied knowledge of the other vehicle?  
         
        
        
         
         Q. Yes? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. That of course was a reference to the Hilux, the red Hilux in which your son Darren was driving? A. That’s correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Now, tell me: What was actually said by you to police about that matter? A. The officer said ‘who was driving the other vehicle.’ I said ‘I don’t know.’ That’s in fact what I said. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. That was the end of it? A. There could have been more words spoken. It has been a long time. It is 1994. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. That of course was Constable Gorman? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. The officer you were speaking to at the side of the road? A. I can’t agree or disagree with this. There is large portions been left out of the police statement in relation to what Mrs Duggan said to him. None of that is recorded here. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Does that relate to the questions I am asking you now? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Let’s not get side tracked: When Constable Gorman asked you if you knew, had knowledge of the other vehicle, and you answered that you did not, I take it that that was a lie? A. Yes, that was a lie. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. To Constable Gorman at the side of the road on that day? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Now, did you also say to Constable Gorman that you were there that morning and you had come to pick up your girlfriend and that her car had broken down? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When you said that, did you indicate the white car that was right next to all three of you? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Well now, were you worried about the fact that the police might associate you with your son Darren on that particular morning? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Were you worried about the fact that the pump was in the back of the car? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Were you worried about giving a true explanation to Constable Gorman as to why you were at Windsor on that particular morning? A. Could you repeat that question again? 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Were you worried about the reason that you were at Windsor on that particular morning? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You see is this the case: That that very pump was destined for the cannabis plantation? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. The very pump that you had in the boot of the car? A. No, it was not. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Was this the case: That the very pump that you had in the back of the car, was the pump in the middle there, exhibit AD? A. No it was not. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Was it in fact the case that you had exhibit AD in the boot of the white car, on that particular morning and you had a guilty conscious about the fact? A. No. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Can I suggest that was the reason you lied to the police as you did? A. No that was not the reason. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Now, at the time that you were pulled over by the police did you know that Darren had the tiller on the back of the red Hilux? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. At the time you were pulled over by the police, did you know that Darren had fittings, and I mean irrigation type fittings, in his car? A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. At the time you were pulled over by police was Darren wearing camouflaged clothing? A. I never seen him. He never got out of the vehicle for me to observe whether he was wearing camouflaged clothing or not. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you see him at all that day? A. Do you mean in the morning when we pulled up?  
         
        
        
         
         Q. No, at any time that day? A. I only seen him sitting in the truck, oh 20 feet away. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you see he was wearing camouflaged clothing? A. No, it was dark sir. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Did you see your son later that day? A. No I did not. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You didn’t go to help him with the strawberry patch later that day? A. No I did not. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Have you ever seen Darren wearing camouflaged clothing? A. Yes I have. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. When? Tell me about it? A. Just around the farm. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. There was camouflaged clothing found by police when they searched Augusta Street? A. Yes that’s correct. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. Was that Darren’s? A. No that was not. 
         
        
        
         
         Q. You gave evidence, I just want to check whether this is just a slip of the tongue: I don’t mean anything sinister by that. I want to clear this up. Do you remember giving evidence that when shown the photograph with the camouflaged clothing found at Augusta Street, by the police, that you said ‘it is Luke Duggan’s for sure’? A. That is correct.” 
         
        
       
     27 In his affidavit the appellant emphasised that it was in early 1997 that Ms Duggan contacted the Department of Public Prosecutions and told an officer of that department that she had information that might assist the department in its case against the appellant. A meeting was set up between her solicitor, who was acting for her in civil proceedings which the appellant had begun against her on 20 December 1996 under the De Facto Relationships Act 1984. The police made available to the solicitor copies of photographs and the appellant’s statement. The resultant statement made by Ms Duggan on 24 July 1997 and police interview on 30 July 1997 referred in particular to a glove with a hole in it and the Tempest brand radio that she claimed belonged to her son Luke Montague.  
      
       
     28 The appellant claimed that Ms Duggan provided this false evidence in order to have the appellant convicted and so defeat the civil proceedings in reliance upon the Felon (Civil Proceedings) Act 1981. Contrast was given between her evidence at the trial and what she said in the civil proceedings. She conceded that she made the statements to the police three years after the appellant’s arrest “out of revenge”. The affidavit extended in various ways to undermine the credit and credibility of Ms Duggan. In the first affidavit the appellant claimed that the Senior Detective in charge of the matter, Detective Henry, was a personal friend of Ms Duggan.  
      
       
     29 The appellant’s counsel canvassed with Ms Duggan various aspects of his condition and custody during her cross-examination (T450.41, 452.25, 452.31, 452.48). At T454, Ms Duggan was cross-examined on an affidavit she swore in 1994 to be used in support of the appellant’s application that he was not fit to stand trial. At T815.5 and T816.04, the appellant gave evidence that he had not made the statements attributed to him by Ms Duggan. Ms Duggan gave evidence at T408-522 and the contentions now put forward by the appellant were discussed exhaustively.  
      
       
     30 During the summing up the trial Judge at pages 18.2-22.5 and 46 gave directions about the possible unreliability of Ms Duggan’s evidence and at 18, 19 and 46 isolated the reasons why she might be unreliable. No additional directions or re-directions were sought. The alleged conspiracy was sufficiently before the jury when they considered the evidence of Ms Duggan. The medical conditions that the appellant suffered were well documented and known both to the appellant and his counsel at the trial. The appellant’s court and custodial history was also known. The appellant, in giving evidence at the trial, chose not to claim that his memory was impaired and gave detailed evidence from memory of events and circumstances of his defence (see T787-793, 793-797, 797-805, 805-833). Apart from matters now raised in the affidavit of Ms Mayorca all other material was before the Court. As I have indicated, I do not think that Ms Mayorca’s evidence is of any weight in determining whether or not there has been a miscarriage of justice. 
      
       
     31 Taking account of all the matters raised by way of grounds of appeal and in the affidavits and other documents to which the appellant has referred I am satisfied that there has been no miscarriage of justice and that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
      
       
        
       Sentence 
        
       
     32 In sentencing the appellant, Judge Knight took account of the whole of the period of two years seven months and twenty-five days that he had spent in custody being two years seven months and eight days between 13 January 1994 and 21 August 1996 and seventeen days between 6 October 1998 and 23 October 1998 when his Honour passed sentence. His Honour said that before taking into account the time in custody the appropriate sentence would have been a total sentence of seven years with a minimum term of four and a half years and an additional term of two and a half years. His Honour reduced both the total sentence and the minimum sentence by the two years seven months and twenty-five days. In his affidavit the appellant referred to what he described as a further eight months that was not taken into account and that was served on remand after his arrest on 25 March 1991 to release on bail on 7 November 1991. The period referred to followed the appellant’s arrest during a police raid on a cannabis plantation in Mount Kaputar National Park as a result of which he was charged with various drug and firearms offences. No explanation is given to support a claim that this period should have been taken into account in determining the sentence for a quite different offence for which he was arrested on 13 January 1994. At the time of this later arrest he was on bail for the Mount Kakputar matters. No other reason was suggested, let alone argued, for interfering with the sentence imposed and that part of the appellant’s appeal should also be dismissed.

      REGINA v CORNELIA ELIZABETH VAN TONGEREN 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
      
      
    1   HEYDON JA: I agree with Smart AJ.2   SMART AJ: Cornelia Elizabeth Van Tongeren appeals against her conviction on one count of by deception dishonestly obtaining money for herself, namely $10,000 on 15 July 1997 and on two counts of by deception dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage for herself namely $20,000 on 14 July 1997 and $6,000 on 4 August 1997 being counts 2, 6 and 7 of the indictment. In each instance she presented a document to the paying bank thereby representing that she was authorised to withdraw the particular funds from the account of her mother-in-law, Catherine Van Tongeren, the complainant. The sum of $10,000 cash was withdrawn from the complainant's account with the National Bank of Australia (National) Emu Plains by the appellant. At her instigation the sums of $20,000 and $6000 were transferred from the complainant's account at Advance Bank (Advance) Penrith into the account of the appellant and her husband, Hank Van Tongeren at the same branch of that bank. The complainant was an elderly lady who was in hospital. As the various events occurred against a tragic background and there were mitigating circumstances, the appellant was given a concurrent and lenient sentence on each count of 50 hours community service.3   The appellant was acquitted on counts 1, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 9, being the counts of dishonestly obtaining an advantage or money by deception.4   The appellant contends that the convictions represent a miscarriage of justice as the jury should have had a reasonable doubt and that the verdicts of guilty on the three counts were inconsistent with the verdicts of not guilty on the other counts.5   Count 1 was based on a form of National headed ""Change of Specimen Signatures"" and dated 8 July 1997 which authorised the appellant to operate the complainant's account with National. The signature ""C. Van Tongeren"" was not that of the complainant although it purported to be so and was so represented to National. That signature was placed there by the appellant who said that she had the complainant's authority to sign her name.6   Count 5 was based on a form of Advance headed ""Authority To Operate"" and dated 14 July 1997 which authorised the appellant to operate the complainant's account. Again the signature ""C. Van Tongeren"" was not that of the complainant although it purported to be so and was so represented to Advance. It was placed there by the appellant who said that she had the complainant's authority to do so. In both instances the appellant contended that the complainant intended that she should operate the account of the complainant. The complainant left it to the appellant to pay the complainant's debts and accounts out of her money.7   Count 3 related to a withdrawal by the appellant from the complainant's account with National of $2200 cash on 9 October 1997 and count 4 to one of $290 cash on 6 February 1998. Count 8 related to a withdrawal by the appellant from the complainant's account with Advance of $1000 cash on 8 October 1997 and count 9 to one of $600 cash on 19 March 1998. 8   These four withdrawals took place after 4 September 1997 being the date of a General Power of Attorney from the complainant to the appellant and of the will of the complainant leaving the whole of her estate to the appellant. The amounts so withdrawn were relatively small and could have been for the purpose of assisting to maintain the complainant. The Crown accepted that it would be hard pressed to secure convictions in respect of the withdrawals after 4 September 1997. The judge in her summing-up quoted the Crown Prosecutor as submitting ""if you were to look at all the evidence, the Crown was confronted with the power of attorney from 4 September 1997 and from that point she may have had a legal (sic) belief that she could access the funds but before 4 September there was no such document"".9   The withdrawals of $10,000, $20,000 and $6000 were in quite a different category. They all took place well prior to 4 September 1997 and they were for the appellant's purposes. The transfers of $20,000 and $6000 from the complainant's account to that of the appellant and her husband made it even harder to accept that the moneys of the complainant were being used for her purposes. The complainant was a pensioner. It is one thing for her to arrange for the appellant to pay her debts out of her moneys while she was ill and recovering. It is quite another for the appellant to denude the complainant of her assets for different purposes. The appellant had no authority to do that. In her summing-up the judge noted that counts 1 and 5 were based on the authorities earlier mentioned and that the other counts were based on withdrawals in the amounts mentioned (in the indictment).10   Prior to June 1997 the complainant, lived in a “granny flat” at the rear of the home occupied by her son and the appellant. The husband of the complainant had died earlier in 1997 and the appellant’s husband was admitted to hospital with a serious illness. The complainant, who was born on 3 March 1918, developed heart problems and on 24 June 1997 she underwent by-pass surgery. She expected to be away from home for about a fortnight. Complications arose after the surgery and she had to stay in hospital and have further surgery. Her stay in hospital became a long one and that depressed her. Because of her prolonged stay she had to make arrangements for her financial affairs to receive attention.11   The appellant said that she visited the complainant in hospital every day and sometimes twice a day. She also visited her husband in hospital. The appellant stated that when the complainant realised that she would be in hospital longer than expected she asked her to collect a parcel from the National. The appellant said that she went to the bank and was told that she would need a letter. She returned to the complainant and advised her accordingly. She told the appellant to ""get some paper and write it out"". The appellant said that she went to the nurse’s desk in the hospital and was given some Westmead Hospital letterhead. The appellant wrote out at the bedside ""This is to say that I give my daughter-in-law permission to pick up my sealed package and operate my account as I am still in hospital. Her name is Cornelia Van Tongeren"". The complainant signed it. The appellant stated that she said ""You can't take that to the bank Nan it's got, it's very scrawly that writing"". The complainant allegedly replied ""Well do another one and you just sign it"" and added ""Can you now pick up my bank books and get my pension put in."" The appellant stated that she said ""Well I won’t be able to operate your account because it doesn't state this on it"". 12   She stated that she then wrote out another note and asked the complainant to sign it. She replied ""No you sign it because it's no good anyway. My signature is no good anyway"". The complainant had swollen hands and was quite ill. The appellant said that she wrote out the document at the hospital in the presence of the complainant but signed the complainant's name at home. This document was taken to the National. It is dated 6 July 1997 and reads: 
     
      
       
        
         
          ""This is to say that I give my daughter-in-law Cornelia Van Tongeren permission to pick up my sealed package as I am still in hospital. She has permission to operate my account."" 
         
        
       
      
    The National gave the appellant the complainant's parcel which contained two bank books and some other papers which bear the writing of the complainant. 
    13   The appellant stated that at each bank she was given a form to complete She filled out the National form at the hospital. The complainant said ""You just do it. I can't do it"". The appellant said that she copied the complainant's signature from her pension card and took the form to National. The appellant further stated that the complainant also told her to fill out the form from Advance. The appellant filled out the form at her home, signed the complainant's name and took the form to Advance.14   At the trial the appellant formally admitted that the signatures ""C. Van Tongeren"" which appear on the National form and the Advance form just mentioned in each case effectively caused the respective banks to allow her to operate the accounts in the name of the complainant.15   About 12 July 1997 or a little before, while still in hospital the complainant became nervous and anxious about some further impending surgery and asked the nurse looking after her to telephone the appellant and ask her to talk to the doctors about the seriousness of such surgery. The Intensive Care Unit Registrar has stated that on the day of the operation, Saturday 12 July 1997, the risks of and necessity for the operation were explained to the complainant. She was alert and orientated and able to understand that there was a significant risk of dying from the operation. She also understood that if she did not undergo the operation and her wound was not cleaned she would die of “certain sepsis from her wound infection"".16   The complainant declined to proceed with the operation until she had made a new will. As the nurse was unsuccessful in her attempts to obtain a solicitor, she spoke with a social worker. She was also unable to obtain a solicitor. The social worker attended on the complainant with a printed will form and filled it out in accordance with the complainant’s wishes. The complainant stated that one of her sons was brain damaged due to a brain tumour and that the other was an alcoholic. Accordingly, she wanted to leave her estate to the appellant. The will was signed and witnessed. Apparently an informal power of attorney was also signed at this time. The operation was performed. The complainant was transferred to the Geriatric Team. It is to be noted that the withdrawals of $20,000 and $10,000 took place on 14 and 15 July 1997 just a few days after the operation of 12 July 1997 and when it was anticipated that the complainant would be in hospital and a nursing home for some time. To procure the withdrawal and transfer of $20,000 on 14 July 1997 the appellant signed a Record of Transaction for Advance, that was the activating document. Similarly the appellant signed a withdrawal for National on 15 July 1997 for $10,000. That enabled the transaction to proceed. On the Crown case and according to the complainant, the appellant had no authority to sign documents withdrawing or transferring moneys for the appellant's own purposes.17   On 4 August 1997 the appellant in order to procure the withdrawal and transfer of $6000, signed a Record of Transaction for Advance. 18   The complainant had a fixed term deposit of about $9000 with National. The appellant said the complainant was very insistent that the term deposit be placed in the appellant's name. The National advised her that the existing authority was not sufficient and that changing over the deposit had to be done by a separate piece of paper. The appellant said that she obtained some Westmead Hospital letterhead. The appellant said that the complainant wrote and signed a document bearing date ""8/8/97"" in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
           ""I Catherine Van Tongeren want my Term deposit to be cancelt (sic) and put in my Daugher (sic) in Law Cornelia Van Tongeren name"". 
          
         
        
       
      
    The appellant placed reliance on this asset being put in her name by the complainant. 
    19   About 8 August 1997 the complainant underwent further procedures in Westmead Hospital. She was subsequently transferred to Nepean Hospital about 12 August 1997. According to the appellant, while the complainant was there a social worker recommended to both of them that a power of attorney and a new will should be prepared and signed. The social worker gave the appellant the names of some solicitors. The appellant contacted Lamrocks, Solicitors. In due course a power of attorney and a will were prepared. The solicitor certified that he explained the effect of the power of attorney before it was executed. The solicitor witnessed the complainant execute the power of attorney and her will.20   The appellant said that while the complainant was in Nepean Hospital for rehabilitation the complainant said to her ""Go and get your new kitchen in. At least I can see where the money's gone"". The appellant said that she was spending money on the poker machines at the time the new kitchen was being installed.21   On 14 October 1997 the complainant was transferred from Nepean Hospital to a nursing home and from there to a second nursing home, Nyora Gardens Nursing Home at Smithfield. She was discharged from that establishment in April 1998. Prior to being discharged, the Director of Nursing told the complainant that the appellant was over $1700 in arrears for nursing home fees. 22   The complainant believed that the appellant was attending to everything including paying the fees of the nursing home. The complainant asked that her bank books be brought and the appellant brought them to her.23   In the course of examining the bank books the complainant discovered that most of her money had gone. The complainant asked the appellant what she did with the money to which the appellant replied ""I put it in the poker machines"".24   The appellant's case was that the complainant, having originally authorised the transactions, had decided to deny having done so because she had discovered that the appellant, as the latter had admitted, had wasted most of the money withdrawn on gambling in poker machines. The appellant attributed this to the unusual and extreme pressure at the time. I have already referred to some of the appellant's evidence as to the circumstances in which the various documents were signed.25   In cross-examination the appellant agreed that there were three conscious decisions on her part to deliberately deceive two banks. The appellant asserted that she was, in effect, asked to do so by the complainant. The appellant also agreed that the power of attorney did not give her carte blanche to spend all the complainant's money on the poker machines.26   The appellant, when asked why she had transferred $20,000 out of the complainant's account into her account said at T24 of 2/2/00: 
     
      
       
       ""A. My mother-in-law said 'Transfer as much money out as you can' because there was talk of nursing home and at the time there was an entry fee to nursing homes or the government was talking about bringing it in. 
       
      
      
       
       Q. Why did you stop at twenty? 
        
       A. Because you could have a certain amount in the bank without it being touched."" 
        
       
      
    27   The cross-examiner then asked a series of questions challenging the appellant's explanations and suggesting that they were incredible. The appellant was unable to be precise about the day on which the complainant gave her the alleged instructions. On her evidence it would seem that it was sometime after the bypass operation on 24 June 1997and before the further operation on 12 July 2000.28   Later in cross-examination when it was put to the appellant that there was no discussion about her being authorised to do anything with the complainant's money the appellant insisted that there was such a discussion. She also gave this evidence (T35-36 of 2/2/00): 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""Q. Furthermore, that by virtue of the deceptions, that you obtained a financial advantage at least in respect to your being able to withdraw money out of her account to your account on two occasions. 
          
          A. Right. 
         
        
        
         
          Q. Being twenty thousand dollars and six thousand dollars and that certainly occurred before there was any power of attorney. 
          
          A. Yes. 
          
         
        
        
         
         Q. You were also able as a result of those deceptions, to withdraw money, cash? 
          
         A. Yes. 
         
        
        
         
          
         Q What I'm putting to you is this; that you undertook those deceptions and operated the accounts and withdrew money, on your evidence, because she told you to do it? 
          
          A. That's right. 
         
        
        
         
          
          Q. Not because you thought you were legally entitled --- 
         
        
        A. No."" 
        
        
       
      
    29   In re-examination the appellant said that in relation to each of the individual transactions on the complainant's accounts she believed that she had the complainant's authority to do so.30   Appeal Ground 2 reads: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""The verdicts of guilty in relation to counts 2, 6 and 7 are inconsistent with the verdicts of not guilty in relation to counts 1, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 9"". 
        
       
      
    31   The appellant relied upon the surprise expressed upon the return of the guilty verdicts by counsel and the judge. The appellant complained that there had been no cross-examination as to counts 2 and 7 but some of the general cross-examination covered these counts. Further, the thrust of the cross-examination as to count 6 dealing with the withdrawal of $20,000 and the general cross-examination made it clear that there was a real contest as to the big withdrawals, namely that they were unauthorised and used for the appellant's own purposes. They were substantial round sums and appeared quite unrelated to the needs of the complainant.32   The appellant contended that the prosecution had been brought principally on counts 1 and 5 and that the prosecution really depended on whether counts 1 and 5 were proved. The forms of authority enabling the appellant to operate the bank accounts of the complainant received much attention but the judge made it clear to the jury that they had to consider the counts based on the authorities and also those based on the withdrawals from National and Advance. Each member of the jury had a copy of the indictment and could follow the differences between the counts as the judge pointed them out. 
     
      
       
      
    33 The transcript of the final speeches of counsel reveals that the key issue at the trial was whether the appellant had acted dishonestly (T.4 of 3/2/00). The Crown Prosecutor when speaking of ""dishonestly"" said ""the Crown sets out to show or prove to you that at the time of each access of the account and at the times of obtaining the advantage she did not have a belief that she had a legal right to access the account (emphasis added). (T.5.10f of 3/2/00). At T10.30 of 3/2/00 the Crown Prosecutor said: 
     
      
       
       ""The Crown perceives that the major issue relates to dishonestly obtaining. Now in other words what the Crown seeks to prove to you beyond reasonable doubt is that the accused did not believe that she had a legal right to access the accounts and withdraw funds from them  
       at those various times"" 
        (emphasis added). 
       
      
      
       
      
    34   The Crown Prosecutor drew attention to the different counts and the advantage or money allegedly received in respect of each count; as to counts 1 and 5 this was access to and operation of the accounts; as to counts 6 and 7 the actual transfer of money from the complainant's account to the appellant's account; and as to the other counts - cash withdrawals.35   At T.8.40-9.27 of 3/2/00 the Crown Prosecutor was critical of the evidence of the appellant that the complainant had authorised the withdrawal of $20,000.36   At T.10.40 of 3/2/00 the Crown Prosecutor referred to the appellant's assertion that she believed she had a right to draw on the account. He contrasted her evidence with the denial by the complainant of the assertion. He added: 
     
      
       
        
         
          ""Look at the timing of the alleged verbal giving of the authority, the timing about when it was and where Mrs Tongeren was at the time and also take into account the dates, the amounts of the withdrawal; 14 July 1997 $20,000 transferred out of Mrs Van Tongeren's account and into the account of the accused; 15 July $10,000 cash; and 4 August$6000 transferred out of the Advance Bank account into the accused's Advance Bank account. When you look at the evidence in … … respect of the matter you might consider and wonder (or ponder?) on the basis of the evidence who was the major beneficiary of those transactions. It might seem to be more the accused than Mrs Van Tongeren Senior."" 
         
        
       
      
      
    37   At the start of the trial (T,.4-5, 31/1/00) the judge gave the jury the conventional direction that they had to consider each charge separately. She reiterated that point in her summing-up and added that the jury would have to return a separate verdict in relation to each count.38   While I accept that the two authorities and the circumstances in which they were signed, including the authorisation of the appellant loomed large at the trial they were not the only issues. The three major withdrawals and especially the one for $20,000 were also plainly raised. Those withdrawals in large, round figurers were stark and spoke volumes in themselves. They were far in excess of any amounts which the complainant had authorised the appellant to obtain for her requirements whilst in hospital. They were obviously made for the appellant's own purposes. The appellant's claim that she was authorised to make them was decidedly thin.39   I agree with the Crown's submission that, in accordance with the judge's directions a correct approach by the jury would be to consider whether in the case of each charge they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant did not believe that she had her mother-in-law's authority. It was clear that the complainant had authorised the appellant to pay certain amounts for her from her pension, for example, fixing her glasses; paying the nursing home.40   The verdicts of not guilty on counts 3, 4, 8 and 9 cannot be regarded as inconsistent with the verdicts on counts 2, 6 and 7. As earlier mentioned the incidents the subject of counts 3, 4, 8 and 9 occurred after the grant of the power of attorney on 4 September 1997 and in respect of which the Crown Prosecutor virtually conceded that he would have difficulty in securing convictions by saying that the appellant ""may have had a legal belief that she could access the funds once she had the power of attorney"".41   The verdicts of guilty on counts 2, 6 and 7 are also not inconsistent with those of not guilty on counts 1 and 5. The jury may not have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant did not believe that she had the complainant's authority to sign the complainant's name to the two authorities thus enabling the appellant to operate the complainant's accounts with National and Advance respectively. The jury may have gone even further and accepted that the complainant herself had authorised the appellant to sign the authorities in the complainant's name so that the appellant could operate the account for legitimate purposes on behalf of the complainant.42   As the Crown pointed out it is one thing to say that the terms of the complainant's authority, so far as the Bank was concerned, authorised all withdrawals. It is another thing to say that the terms of the complainant's authority, so far as the appellant was concerned, authorised all withdrawals.43   Appeal Ground 2 fails.44   Appeal Ground 1 reads: 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""In all the circumstances of the trial, convictions in relation to counts 2, 6 and 7 represents a miscarriage of justice"". 
         
        
       
      
    45   The appellant took the Court through the complainant's evidence and the documents which existed and submitted that her evidence was inconsistent with the documents and that the documentary material supported the appellant's case. There are serious questions about the accuracy and reliability of some of the complainant's evidence. Counsel was correctly critical of it. The deficiencies and problems with it probably led to the appellant's acquittal on most of the counts. However, the position as to counts 2, 6 and 7 was different. There the objective evidence in the form of large withdrawals in round figures applied for the appellant's own purposes was cogent.46   The appellant's submissions fail to distinguish between her having authority to operate the accounts as far as the Banks were concerned and for proper purposes and her lack of authority to make large withdrawls for her own purposes in mid July and early August 1997. The appellant erroneously took a global approach to all counts, lumping them together although, of course, this suited her interests. The Crown had a strong case on counts 2, 6 and 7 and I would have been surprised if there had not been convictions on these counts.47   There has been no miscarriage of justice on the evidence or in the conduct of the proceedings. It was not suggested that the judge's directions were erroneous.48   Appeal Ground 1 fails.49   I propose that the appeal against the three convictions be dismissed.50   IRELAND AJ: I agree with Smart AJ ****************

      REGINA v. FRANK PETER PETRINOVIC 
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1   HIS HONOUR: On 19 July 1999, the prisoner pleaded guilty before me to one count of the murder of Ian Hagarty at Lurnea on 26 October 1997. It was common ground that that count embraced a crime of attempted robbery being armed with a dangerous weapon. 
    2   The Crown accepted that the plea was made on the basis of felony murder as is referred to in s.18 of the Crimes Act 1900 and conceded that on the facts it did not seek to rely on any of the intentional states necessary for murder referred to in that section. 
    3   On the hearing of the plea, I was provided by consent with the following statement of facts:- 
     
      
       
       ""At about 5.30 pm on Sunday 26 October 1997, the prisoner, Frank Petrinovic, and a co-offender, Mandie Jancek, drove to the vicinity of the Liquorland Bottle Shop, located at the corner of Hill Road and Reilly Street, Lurnea. Both the prisoner and Jancek travelled there in vehicle MOW-739, a 1983 Holden Commodore sedan owned by the prisoner. 
       
      
      
       
       The prisoner got out of the vehicle in Reilly Street. He put on a black balaclava and surgical gloves and armed himself with a loaded .32 calibre Argentina brand revolver. At the time he was also carrying a red plastic Grace Bros. shopping bag. 
       
      
      
       
       The prisoner walked into the Liquorland Bottle Shop through the Reilly Street entrance. He walked towards the cash register and confronted the two employees on duty, Ian Hagarty and Troy Stephens. 
       
      
      
       
       The prisoner ordered the two employees to the ground. Both complied. The prisoner stood over both employees and pointed the loaded revolver in their direction. The prisoner threw the Grace Bros. bag he was carrying behind the counter and said, 'fill up the bag'. Mr. Hagarty stood up and said, 'alright mate, I'll do it'. 
       
      
      
       
       At that point a struggle started between the prisoner and Mr. Hagarty. During the struggle, two shots were discharged from the revolver by the prisoner. One of the bullets struck Mr. Hagarty in the right side of the neck. The bullet partially severed the left pulmonary artery of the left lung and travelled through the left posterior rib cage. In the opinion of the forensic pathologist who carried out the post-mortem examination on Mr. Hagarty, the death of Mr. Hagarty was caused by this gun shot wound. The second bullet did not enter Mr. Hagarty's body. It created a combined entry/exit wound. 
       
      
      
       
       Mr. Hagarty continued to struggle with the prisoner after the shots were fired, eventually taking the revolver off the prisoner and staggering away. He later collapsed in the driveway area. 
       
      
      
       
       Around this time, a number of the customers in the shop came to the aid of Mr. Hagarty. The prisoner was restrained by the customers in the driveway area. 
       
      
      
       
       At that point the co-offender Jancek entered the shop on foot and attempted to pull away the customers who were restraining the prisoner. She was unsuccessful and she left the shop. Jancek then returned a short time later driving vehicle MOW-739. She drove the vehicle into the bottle shop, and drove at the prisoner and the customers, narrowly missing a number of people. 
       
      
      
       
       This resulted in the prisoner breaking free of the customers for a short time. The prisoner attempted to get into the vehicle driven by Jancek, but was unable to do so. The prisoner then picked up a house brick and threatened the witnesses who were trying to detain him. 
       
      
      
       
       The prisoner ran out onto the footpath of Reilly Street where he was again restrained by customers until police arrived. The prisoner was taken into custody by police, together with the co-offender Jancek who was restrained by witnesses in the motor vehicle she was driving. 
       
      
      
       
       Mr. Hagarty was taken by ambulance to Liverpool Hospital, but soon after died of his injuries. 
       
      
      
       
       Located at the scene was the loaded revolver used by the prisoner, the balaclava worn by the prisoner which was removed by one of the witnesses who tried to detain him, surgical gloves worn by the prisoner, and the Grace Bros. shopping bag. 
       
      
      
       
       A search was made of the vehicle owned by the prisoner. Located in the vehicle was a radio scanner which was set on the police channel for the Liverpool area, and a box of surgical gloves. 
       
      
      
       
       The prisoner was taken by police to Liverpool Police Station. Later he was taken to Liverpool Hospital where he was treated for injuries sustained by him at the scene. The prisoner was later returned to Liverpool Police Station where he was interviewed. The prisoner stated that he did not wish to comment about what had occurred."" 
       
      
    4   The detail of that statement was not in contest before me and I was provided with statements from the various witnesses to support it. I accept that statement as setting out the immediate factual context of the offence. 
    5   Subsequent to the entry of the plea, the sentencing proceedings were stood over to enable preparation of appropriate material by the Crown and preparation of relevant written submissions. When the matter came back before me, in addition to the two victim impact statements, which were provided to me during the plea and which I treated in accordance with s.23C of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 and the principles set out in Regina v. Previtera (1998) 94 A. Crim. R. 76, I was provided with two documents summarising the prisoner's appalling prior criminal record and also his gaol movements. Those documents are annexed to this judgment. They refer to the numerous previous armed robbery and other serious offences committed while the prisoner was on parole or while an escapee. The present offence was committed some four and a half months after the prisoner's release from custody and whilst he was on parole. 
    6   Although the documentation including the document provided to me setting out in extenso the prisoner's prior record refers to various different birth dates, I have been informed that the prisoner was born on 15 March 1960 and is thus presently 39 years old and will proceed on that basis. 
    7   I have been further informed that prior to his entry into an adult gaol at the age of 18, the prisoner had spent a considerable period of his life from the age of 10 onwards in institutions. 
    8   The annexed document headed ""Gaol movements"" calculates the prisoner's total time in custody not including the time in juvenile detention centres or institutions and their equivalents, as 17 years, 18 days, ie., the prisoner has been in gaol for almost all of his adult life and in institutions for the greater part of his life. His time at liberty has been almost entirely as an escapee or whilst on parole. 
    9   In addition to the material with which I was provided concerning the prisoner's prior record, I was referred to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal of 18 September 1990 in respect of three applications by him for leave to appeal against sentence, which applications were refused. In the judgment is set out at some length and in some detail the circumstances of the 12 offences of armed robbery, one offence of larceny of a motor vehicle, two offences of escape lawful custody, two of assaulting police in the execution of their duty, in respect of which the prisoner had been sentenced to a total head sentence of 14 years and a total non-parole period which expired only shortly prior to the commission of the present offence. 
    10   Although the prisoner pleaded guilty and is therefore entitled to the benefit of s.439 of the Crimes Act, that plea was entered but a week before trial in circumstances in which the prisoner was arrested at the scene of the crime which was witnessed by numerous persons, immediately after its commission. The case against him, in those circumstances, was entirely overwhelming. However, the Crown had sought to proceed on the basis the prisoner had an intent to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm or was recklessly indifferent to human life up until shortly before the plea. 
    11   As soon as the Crown indicated its willingness to rely on felony murder to the exclusion of any intentional basis for the killing, the plea was offered. It is thus of significance as negating a deliberate killing and some, but very limited significance as reflecting in itself an element of contrition or remorse. Nonetheless, the trial itself would have involved some weeks of court time and the attendance of numerous witnesses had it proceeded. In that sense, there has been a saving to the community which at least reflects on the prisoner's part some consciousness for others from which he might benefit by way of showing some prospect of conformity with the requirements of society. 
    12   The prisoner gave evidence on his own behalf during which he expressed sorrow and contrition. I have no doubt that his expression of that before me in the witness box was genuinely felt. It accords with what he said to Dr. Westmore whose report of 19 August 1999 was in evidence and with the observations of Sue Jefferies, Clinical Nurse Consultant and Rhonda Danylenko, Department of Community Services, AOD Worker, both from the Corrections Health Service in their report dated 30 July 1999. I accept from that evidence rather than the plea that he has some degree of remorse for what he has done and some sorrow for the harm that he has caused. 
    13   I turn to the role in this offence of the prisoner's use of and addiction to drugs and his previous offences. 
    14   The reports to which I have referred and the prisoner's own evidence disclose that he had first started using heroin at the age of 18 at the time of his first gaol sentence. He has apparently been addicted to heroin or using methadone, except for some intervals whilst in gaol, over a period of 20 years. His evidence, which was in this regard corroborated by the observations of the authors of the Corrections Health Service report was, that at the time of his release from custody he had been advised to maintain a dosage of 80 mgs of methadone (having been maintaining a dosage of 50 mgs in gaol) but had, contrary to advice, restricted his dosage to 40 mgs, asserting an attempt to fight his addiction, but notwithstanding the advice he had received from AOD workers that a return to heroin use would mean a return to gaol and the provision to him of assistance by way of professional support and counselling, found himself unable to cope, returned to heroin and to his course of violent criminality. 
    15   The prisoner had used heroin three times on the day of the offence, on the last occasion about 15 minutes before going to Liquorland and had used that day a total of a gram to a gram and a half of heroin. In addition, he had told Ms. Jefferies and Ms. Danylenko, Dr. Westmore and Professor Starmer, with whose report as to the effects of the drugs I was also provided, that he had used about 100 to 120 milligrams of methadone syrup, had taken two Rohypnols and had drunk about half a bottle of Bourbon. The effects of these, according to Professor Starmer, would have been such that it was likely that his ability for clear logical reasoning would have been greatly reduced and his appreciation of the possible consequences of his actions also reduced. Professor Starmer stated that all those drugs have central nervous system depressant activity and therefore the cognitive and information processing functions would be expected to have been impaired. 
    16   Although on an issue of criminal liability intoxication might go to negate the formation of a specific criminal intent, in sentencing the question of whether it is a mitigating or aggravating feature depends upon the circumstances (see Regina v. Coleman (1990) 47 A. Crim. R. 306 at 327). 
    17   It is quite apparent that this offence was committed whilst under the influence of drugs in order to obtain money for drugs. It was committed as the culmination of a long history of violent crime committed in the context of drug involvement just as had been the offences dealt with by this court on the applications for leave to appeal against sentence to which I have referred (see Regina v. Petrinovic (CCA, unreported 18 September 1990). Hunt, J. (as he then was), with whom Wood, J. (as he then was) and McInerney, J. agreed, said, at p.9:- 
     
      
       
       ""The citizens of this community are sick and tired of armed robberies conducted by criminals in order to feed their drug habits. The cost of the precautions which must be taken by banks and by other businesses dealing with cash is enormous, and that cost has necessarily been passed on to the whole community. More seriously, the violence so often involved and the fear inevitably engendered in staffs (sic) and in customers alike has aggravated the epidemic-like proportions of this crime wave engulfing the community. So far as I am concerned, this court will continue to support judges who recognise these serious crimes and who impose heavy sentences for them. The community expects it of the courts, and it is bitterly disappointed when undue leniency is shown by the courts because some thug cries that he has had an unhappy upbringing and promises that he will get rid of his drug habit, as has this applicant."" 
       
      
    18   Notwithstanding that the Crown did not seek to show that the prisoner deliberately became intoxicated to facilitate the commission of the offence, nonetheless I see no basis on which his crime is mitigated by the effects of the drugs on him. Nor do I see any basis on which his long term drug addiction could be regarded as mitigatory where, whenever he has been at liberty, in order to feed that addiction, he has resorted again and again to crimes of deliberately terrorising others, the appalling consequences of which, even if nothing went wrong, were likely to involve permanent effects on the victims. Importantly as here, such crimes in themselves, even if not committed in circumstances of drug intoxication, have the all too great potential to result in someone's death. Their fatal potential is reflected in the retention of the felony murder provision in s.18 of the Crimes Act. The whole purpose of the conduct involved in the offence of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon is to pose a real threat of death to compel victims to hand over property. Where that death has been so caused there is little room to find the offence is any less culpable and good reason to consider it as at least as culpable as murder committed intentionally. 
    19   Having regard to these considerations and to the matters referred to by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v. Henry & Ors [1999] NSWCCA 111 by the Chief Justice at 194 and 202, by Wood, CJ. at CL. at 273 and Simpson, J. at 344, I see no basis on which the prisoner's general involvement with drugs or his intoxication on this occasion should in the circumstances of this case be treated as mitigatory. They certainly do not render the objective circumstances of this offence less culpable. 
    20   The Crown submitted that the case called for the imposition of the maximum penalty.  
    21   The statutory scheme prescribing the maximum penalty has become complex. By virtue of s.19A, the maximum penalty for the crime of murder is penal servitude for life. Section 19A(2) provides that a person sentenced to penal servitude for life is to serve that sentence for the term of the person's natural life. Part 11 of the Sentencing Act 1989 does not apply (s.13(c)) so that the provision under that Part of minimum and additional terms is unavailable. Section 19A(3) preserves the operation of s.442 which authorises the passing of a lesser sentence than a statutory maximum. 
    22   Section 431A of the Crimes Act provides that a person is not liable to the punishment of penal servitude for life for any offence except for the offences of murder or certain offences under the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. By s.431A(3) it is provided that where no penalty is otherwise provided for an offence that was formerly punishable by penal servitude for life, that offence is now to be punishable by penal servitude for 25 years. The section also refers to amendments made by the Crimes (Life Sentences) Amendment Act 1989 altering penalties for offences under the Act from penal servitude for life to penal servitude for 25 years. 
    23   In the event that a trial judge does not pass a sentence of life imprisonment for murder, the maximum sentence that might be passed in the exercise of discretion is at large and is not restricted by the greatest maximum now prescribed for other offences of 25 years.  
    24   The offence of attempted armed robbery being armed with a dangerous weapon, the foundational felony for the murder felony here is the aggravated form of the offence provided for by s.97 and is punishable by penal servitude for 25 years.  
    25   At the time of the commission of the present offence s.431B, which came into operation on 30 June 1996, applied. Section 431B, the history and nature of which is reviewed by the New South Wales Law Reform Commission in ""Sentencing"" Report 79, provides for the mandatory life sentence to be passed by the court on a person convicted of murder if the court ""is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence"" (emphasis added). Section 431B(3) provides that nothing in s.431B(1) affects s.442, apparently preserving the discretion. But in the circumstances referred to in s.431B(1), there is no discretion but to impose the life sentence when one has regard to the language of the provision. The criteria appearing in s.431B(1) are those to which regard must be paid not whether the offence was in ""the worst class of case"" for which maximum penalties were reserved at common law (Ibbs v. The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 447). The statutory criteria in s.431B were developed in the light of previous judicial pronouncements. 
    26   Prior to the enactment of s.431B and the provision of statutory criteria, the relevant test for the identification of a crime warranty the imposition of a life sentence under s.19A was expressed in Regina v. Twala (CCA, unreported 4 November 1994) in the judgment of Badgery-Parker, J. at 7:- 
     
      
       
       ""It must be possible to point to particular features which are of very great heinousness and it must be possible to postulate the absence of facts mitigating the seriousness of the crime (as distinct from subjective features mitigating the penalty to be imposed)."" 
       
      
    27   In Regina v. Garforth (CCA, unreported 31 March 1994), it was submitted that even absent continuing dangerousness as referred to in The Queen v. Veen (No. 1) (1979) 143 CLR 458, and where there may be prospects of rehabilitation, nevertheless, a life sentence can be appropriate and in that regard the court referred to:- 
     
      
       
       ""… those cases where the level of culpability was so extreme that the community interest in retribution and punishment can only be met through the imposition of the maximum penalty."" 
       
      
    28   In the Second Reading Speech on the Crimes Amendment (Mandatory Life Sentences) Bill in 1995, the Attorney-General referred to that statement and described the provision as requiring the imposition of a sentence of penal servitude for life if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability ""in the commission of the offence"" is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can be met ""only"" through the imposition of that sentence. Otherwise he said s.442 provided for the exercise of a discretion to impose less than a life sentence. The Attorney-General and the drafting of the provision appear to have envisaged that it is the form the murder takes (ie., its factual circumstances) which is relevant. The Attorney-General said:- 
     
      
       
       ""It is appropriate to observe here that the offence of murder takes many and varied forms. It is difficult, if not impossible, to foresee every factual circumstance capable of constituting a murder which, on its face, demonstrates an extreme degree of criminality. We are not so prescient that we can confidently assert that there will never come a time when such a crime calls for something less than life imprisonment. It may well do so when the offender is a juvenile. For this reason the discretion to impose less than life remains, although it is a discretion which cannot be lightly exercised in the face of the principle expressed in the Bill."" 
       
      
    29   He had already said that the provision ""will mandate a life sentence for those offences to which the legislation applies and leave the community in no doubt of this Government's intention to remain tough on crime"". 
    30   When the successor to the Bill as originally introduced came before the Legislative Council on 17 April 1996, the Attorney-General reiterated his earlier observations, but added in the light of the report of the standing Committee on Law and Justice, a reference to an exemption for juveniles and a greater clarity to the role to be performed by s.442:- 
     
      
       
       ""Section 442 allows a sentencing judge to impose less than a life sentence in the exercise of his or her discretion. 
       
      
      
       
       The preservation of that discretion does no more than recognise the possibility that a murder, which, on its face, demonstrates an extreme degree of criminality, may nevertheless call for something less than life imprisonment. For this reason the discretion to impose less than life remains …"" 
       
      
    31   The provision plainly is intended to alter the common law applicable to sentencing for crimes for which a mere maximum is prescribed by the legislature. 
    32   Although the imposition of the sentence is described as lying in discretion, s.431B(1) on its face requires the imposition of the sentence in the event that the court is satisfied of the level of culpability therein expressed. 
    33   Considering what was said by the Attorney-General and the language used in s.431B(1), it appears that the section is meant to apply to the culpability involved in the commission of the crimes and that is not to be limited as defined merely by the immediate factual circumstances. 
    34   Even as to those, there is some doubt as to whether the relevant test requires the culpability of the factual circumstances of the individual offence, standing alone, to justify the imposition of penal servitude for life (see Regina v. Street (CCA, unreported 17 December 1996)). It is not necessary to resolve that matter here. 
    35   To ascertain the relevant culpability, in my view regard must be had to the criteria expressed in the section and the expression of them in Veen v. The Queen (No. 2) (1987-1988) 164 CLR 465 by the High Court when it dealt with the principle of proportionality and the appropriateness of a sentence passed to protect the community against recidivism where the prior record manifests a continuing attitude of disobedience to the law. The court held that in those circumstances a more severe penalty may be warranted to serve the ends of retribution, deterrence and protection of society. It was held that it was legitimate to utilise the previous history to illuminate the moral culpability of the offender or as showing a dangerous propensity or a need to impose condign punishment to deter him and other offenders from committing similar offences. 
    36   Similarly, the purpose of sentencing has been expressed by Badgery-Parker, AJ. in Regina v. Dean Anthony & Michael Privett [1999] NSWSC 1076 when adopting what had been said by Allen, J. in Regina v. Camilleri (CCA, unreported 8 February 1990). His Honour quoted the following passage from that judgment:- 
     
      
       
       ""In seeking to determine in any case the sentence appropriate to a particular crime it is always of importance to have regard to the gravity of the offence viewed objectively. Unless that is done the other facts requiring consideration in order to arrive at the proper sentence cannot be given their rightful place. A sentence imposed must be commensurate with the seriousness of the crime in the sense that it should, having regard to the all the proved circumstances, accord with the general moral sense of the community. It should also serve as a sufficient deterrent both to the offender and to others. The purpose of that deterrence is to prevent the commission of such offences, and whilst justice and humanity require that the previous character and conduct and the probable future life and conduct of the individual offender should be given most careful consideration, those are factors which are necessarily subsidiary to the main consideration which determines the appropriate amount of punishment, that is the protection of the public. The fundamental purpose of punishment is the protection of society. Unless those basic principles of sentencing are adhered to, errors will occur."" 
       
      
    37   I consider that when regard is had to those principles on an evaluation of the particular facts and surrounding circumstances of the crime (in which I include other related crime or criminal record relevant in the sense referred to in Veen (No. 2) (supra)) and the conclusion reached that the level of culpability is such that the community's interests as so identified can only be met by the permanent deprivation of liberty then the maximum sentence is called for. 
    38   Here the Crown in the context of what had been said in Veen (No. 2) (supra) submitted that the very great heinousness to which Badgery-Parker, J. referred in Twala (supra) must be taken to include not only the actual manner in which the crime was committed, but also the antecedent criminal history of the offender. I accept that submission as applicable to s.431B criteria. 
    39   Some guidance may be gained from previous decisions for whether in these circumstances this case satisfies the statutory criteria even though they may have been given under the previous statutory or common law regime. 
    40   The offence of murder by reason of felony murder arising out of the use of a firearm in the course of an armed robbery is treated most seriously by the courts (see Regina v. Mills (Wood, J., unreported 2 June 1994). Here, as in Mills (supra), the prisoner had deliberately and consciously brought to the scene of the crime and presented to the deceased a weapon in a loaded state to commit an armed robbery and in circumstances where resistance or spontaneous or unwilled discharge of the weapon must, or should, have been in contemplation even in the prisoner's intoxicated state. Here the prisoner's record illustrates his familiarity with how the courts regard such conduct even without the fatal consequence. His crime was very grave indeed. 
    41   The suggestion that cases of felony murder such as this involve a lower level of culpability than cases of murder involving intention to kill and therefore should receive a lower level of sentence, has been rejected by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v. Mills (CCA, unreported 3 April 1995). That rejection occurred in facts not unlike those in the present case. The court was of the view that in such circumstances such a case of murder involved a very high degree of seriousness. It did not, however, hold that such was the worst class of case. 
    42   But it is clear that there may be differing degrees of objective culpability even within felony murder (see Regina v. JB, Regina v. RJH [1999] NSWCCA 93). 
    43   In Regina v. Salameh [1999] NSWCCA 300, the Court of Criminal Appeal on an appeal against a re-determination of a life sentence to a sentence comprising a minimum term of 23 years and an additional term of the prisoner's natural life, considered the sentence in the context of circumstances not unlike the present. That offender had a prior record almost as appalling as that of the present prisoner and his circumstances had been assessed by the trial judge as follows:- 
     
      
       
       ""The applicant's shocking criminal history and present background cause uncertainty in relation to the question of his rehabilitation. I believe there is a serious question as to the extent to which he would represent a danger to the community on being released to parole. On present indications there is a substantial basis for concluding that he will commit further crimes if he is released. This is not case of an uncharacteristic aberration. It is a case of an offender who has manifested a complete contempt of the courts and procedures of law in this country. In such a case retribution, deterrence and protection of society require that a more severe penalty is warranted than would ordinarily be the case."" 
       
      
    44   The Court of Criminal Appeal upheld the sentence imposed by the trial judge applying the totality principle in accordance with what the High Court had said in The Queen v. Pearce (1998) 156 ALR 684. It was not suggested that that record was such that by application to the re-determination situation of the principles which now are expressed in s.431B, the appellant should be denied a determinate minimum term. 
    45   I have particular regard for the terrible significance of a sentence of life imprisonment as provided for by s.19A, which removes forever the prospect of release, and what has been said in regard to that sentence in such cases as Garforth (supra); Regina v. Petrov (Hunt, CJ. at CL., unreported 12 November 1991); Regina v. Baker (CCA, unreported 20 September 1995) and Regina v. Rose (Levine, J., unreported 3 September 1998). 
    46   I have compared the circumstance of the present offence with those set out in the schedule of life sentences under s.19A with which I had been provided. The cases are not exhaustive but do embrace most of those where such a sentence has been passed. They include the sentences passed on John Wayne Glover, Rodney Francis Cameron, Malcolm George Baker, Maxwell Harold Trotter, Robert Mark Steele, Ivan Milat, Edwin Thomas Street, Richard William Leonard, Earl Heatley, Arthur Stanley Smith, Garry Zane Glasby and Lindsay Robert Rose. Most of these crimes involved multiple murders with a common factor or connection between the crimes such as would aggravate each (see Street (supra)). 
    47   Alternatively, they were crimes committed in circumstances of extreme callousness and depravity. They are to be contrasted with the crimes of murder for which sentences other than life imprisonment have been passed, an extensive schedule of which was also provided to me. I have also considered the sentence statistics from the Judicial Commission for what limited assistance they can give. 
    48   Even where, as here, the commission of the offence is attended by the circumstances and the appalling record I have referred to, and the position is such that, when considered in conjunction with the prisoner's drug addiction, the prospect of the prisoner ever being rehabilitated or, at least, being rehabilitated prior to, as Dr. Westmore put it, ""advancing years in and of themselves being … likely to reduce his overall risks of re-offending"" is limited, nonetheless, after considering in the way I have described the kinds of case for which the life penalty has been imposed, I am not satisfied , even before turning to the prisoner's subjective circumstances, that the prisoner's present crime meets the statutory criteria. 
    49   I accept that the life penalty is not reserved for those crimes where there is no possibility of rehabilitation (Garforth (supra)). 
    50   Having evaluated all relevant matters, I have concluded that this is not a case where the circumstances require the imposition of the sentence under s.431B(1). I am of the view that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can be met otherwise than by the imposition of that sentence in the context of the discretion that remains with me. I am therefore not satisfied of the matters of which I must be satisfied before passing the mandatory sentence. 
    51   I am of the view that the sentence that I will pass will be of such length that, even in the context of Dr. Westmore's observations, the purposes of sentencing referred to in the section and by the High Court in Veen (No. 2) (supra) will be served and that the statutory criteria can be met by a determinate sentence. 
    52   However, having regard to the prisoner's prior record in the sense referred to in Veen (No. 2) (supra), together with the fact that the armed robbery offence he was committing was itself an offence which approached the worst class of case for such offences, even putting aside its fatal consequences, and to the fact that a life has been taken in this way make it necessary, notwithstanding the prisoner's subjective circumstances to which I will turn in a moment, to pass on the prisoner a sentence of great severity. 
    53   I note also that it would appear likely, because of the prisoner's record of escapes and breaches of parole, that whilst in custody he will be detained in circumstances of strict security for a substantial portion of his sentence. Whilst this may be onerous for him, nonetheless, it arises because of his own actions and although regard must be had to that matter, it cannot itself or in combination with the other subjective circumstances, reduce the length of the sentence that must be passed to such a point that the sentence would become unduly disproportionate to the extreme gravity of his crime. 
    54   I turn to matters personal to the prisoner. His incarceration history as summarised by Ms. Jefferies and Ms. Danylenko commenced with his entry to a boys' home at the age of 10½, the Juvenile Justice System at age 14 and to adult gaols at age 18 when he acquired his heroin dependence. He has had very little experience with any other community life or with personal relationships. 
    55   He had told Dr. Westmore that during the 10 years prior to his release from custody shortly before committing this offence, he had been on methadone and about four to six weeks after his release started re-using heroin, having formed his association with the prisoner Jancek. 
    56   I take the following material from the unchallenged recitation of the prisoner's prior circumstances in the report of Dr. Westmore. 
    57   He had initially turned to cannabis at 15 and heroin at 18. He had also tried numerous other illegal substances. He has been unable, despite a number of attempts, to achieve any degree of rehabilitation, notwithstanding his attending the WHO's Programme and having been involved in gaol programmes for many years. 
    58   He was born in Yugoslavia and came to Australia with his family at the age of one year. His parents separated when he was aged 10 or 11 years. His father took him back to Yugoslavia against his mother's wishes and she had disappeared when he and his father returned to Australia. He lived at that time with his father but his father did not send him to school. His mother, with whom he has lately resumed some contact, lives in Newcastle and he has siblings with whom he has a poor relationship except with his younger brother. 
    59   Dr. Westmore, after referring to the prisoner's father not sending him to school, continues:- 
     
      
       
       ""Welfare agencies became involved and Mr. Petrinovic was initially placed into the care of family friends who were unkind and possibly abused him. He ran away from that home and was then cared for by a prostitute and her boyfriend. The police caught him and he was put into a boys' home for two years. At that time he could not return to his father because the welfare authorities would not allow this and his mother did not want him. 
       
      
      
       
       He was then placed into another institution for two years because there was nowhere else for him to go. He ran away to Kings Cross where he met another young person and they went to Tamworth where the young person had lived. 
       
      
      
       
       In Tamworth Mr. Petrinovic and the young person broke into garages, they were caught and Mr. Petrinovic was placed back into a boys' home for nine months. He was aged 14½ at this time. 
       
      
      
       
       His mother than agreed to take him back provided he got a job and he then worked with a carpenter until the age of 18. He lived at some stage in Bathurst with the carpenter and his family and he worked successfully there until work ran out and he returned to Sydney. 
       
      
      
       
       Back in Sydney he engaged in a break and enter matter and was sent to prison for 12 months and it was at that time that he started using heroin. 
       
      
      
       
       On his release he was breaking and entering homes to get money to provide for his heroin habit and he then served another nine months in prison, being released in April 1982. 
       
      
      
       
       He returned to prison in January 1983 for two armed robberies, he did four years and escaped from custody once during that sentence. He was then out of prison for four and a half months before being detained again for a series of armed robberies, he received a sentence of 10 years. He was then out of prison again for four and a half months before the current matter occurred. 
       
      
      
       
       I asked him about education and he said he attended first form and possibly second form, he is literate. I enquired about employment and he said he worked with the carpenter between the ages of 14½ and 18 but he has held no other employment. He has held some short term relationships and he has some prison tattoos."" 
       
      
    60   Dr. Westmore detected no psychosis but concluded his report:- 
     
      
       
       ""This 39 year old man has, from the history, clearly led a life of extreme deprivation. He has been institutionalised for most of his life, this occurred after his parents separated when he was aged 10 or 11 years. The initial disappearance of his mother and later her rejection of him would have been extremely traumatic for this man when he was a child. Mr. Petrinovic's father also appears to have had some difficulties and that man failed to make Mr. Petrinovic attend school which attracted the attention of the welfare authorities. 
       
      
      
       
       Mr. Petrinovic has had a severely restricted education and a very limited work history. The most stable period of his life appears to have occurred between the ages of 14½ and 18 when he was working with a carpenter and living for a period with that man and his family. 
       
      
      
       
       At the age of 18 while in custody he was introduced to the drug heroin, he developed a habit which extended up until the most recent incident. While serving a term of imprisonment which lasted 10 years he commenced methadone and he continued methadone on his release from custody but he was unable to remain heroin free. The incident before the court at the time occurred as a direct consequence of this man's heroin addiction, his possession of a firearm and perhaps to some extent a degree of polydrug intoxication. 
       
      
      
       
       During my meeting with him he appeared to be a subdued, despondent man with a restricted affect. He spoke spontaneously about his feelings of sadness regarding the death of the deceased and he talked about his life in a rather hopeless way. 
       
      
      
       
       He no doubt suffers a degree of institutionalisation having been incarcerated for such an extended period of time. He is unskilled and he has had a very limited experience with employment. I am uncertain what 'pre-release support' this man had before his discharge back into the community or what support was available to him in the months leading up to this offence but in many ways looking at his life history one could almost have predicted that this man would have experienced further difficulties when he returned to the community. His deprived background, his lack of education and opportunity, his heroin habit, his history of offending all placed him in the high risk category of being unable to cope, adjust or survive back in the community. 
       
      
      
       
       He is resigned to facing an extremely long sentence and he appeared to accept this as being an inevitable part of the sequence of events which followed the death of Mr. Hagarty. 
       
      
      
       
       This man obviously is unlikely to be released for a number of years and while it is too early to predict his re-offending risk at this time, one can say that advancing years in and of themselves are likely to reduce his overall risks of re-offending. Hopefully during his incarceration he will receive some drug counselling and eventually become methadone free."" 
       
      
    61   Even accepting, as I do, that the prisoner's childhood was deprived, and that in the circumstances his addiction could hardly be described as a considered matter of personal choice, nonetheless it appears to me that at best one can say that the prospect of recidivism is high and that there is little, if any, prospect of rehabilitation except in the sense spoken of by Dr. Westmore. The sentence I intend to impose will involve retribution, deterrence and protection for a period so long that Dr. Westmore's observation cannot, from a view this remote, be predicted as likely to be incorrect. 
    62   This is a man for whom there is little prospect and against whom, because of the matters to which I have referred, the community is entitled to have protection, in the light of his addiction and the record of the crimes he has committed in feeding that addiction. This is not to say that record is to be used to aggravate the sentence. But it is to say one can find little room for leniency that might otherwise have been compassionately extended where the community is put at such risk and where a crime so grave, as involves the taking of a human life, particularly in circumstances so serious as this armed robbery, has been committed. There is a necessity to deter him and others and to protect the community against his demonstrated dangerous propensity. 
    63   It would be appropriate since the sentence I will impose already reflects the fact that the offence was committed whilst on parole, that it be dated from the day on which the prisoner returned to custody, 26 October 1997 in accordance with the principle stated in Regina v. Kaiva (CCA, unreported 9 November 1998). 
    64   I also consider that the length of the sentence and the obvious necessity that the prisoner should be under supervision for a very long while, if on parole after serving such a long custodial period, constitutes special circumstances in that a longer than usual additional term will be required and I am of the view that a lengthy additional term in this case is appropriate as a continuing sanction. 
    65   Regulation 10A of the Sentencing (General) Regulation 1996 provides that terms or conditions of parole orders must not require the offender to be subject to supervision for a period of more than three years after the date of release but that the Board may, in the case of a serious offender, vary the term or condition so as to extend the period of supervision for a further period of up to three years, once only. Such a condition will become a condition of parole pursuant to Regulation 10 and as a consequence, supervision will be provided pursuant to Regulation 11. 
    66   Thus up to six years of supervision may be provided, however, the additional term does not exist solely for the purpose of the provision of supervision. Indeed, an additional term should reflect those elements referred to by the High Court in Regina v. Bugmy (1990) 169 CLR 525 and may well include, in addition to a period for which supervision is prescribed, a further period during which the offender remains subject to the sanction of return to custody so as to reinforce rehabilitation and to provide protection, albeit of a more limited kind than that provided for by custody, to the community. At this time I would consider both the availability of that sanction and the extended period of supervision to be most important matters. 
    67   Having regard to all the above circumstances, I am of the view that a total sentence of 27 years penal servitude with a minimum term of 20 years is called for.  
    68   Mr. Petrinovic you are sentenced to penal servitude for a minimum term of 20 years to date from 26 October 1997 and to expire on 25 October 2017. There will be an additional term thereafter of seven years to date from 26 October 2017 and to expire on 25 October 2024. The earliest date on which the prisoner will be eligible for release on parole is 25 October 2017.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: Following a trial before Acting Judge Maguire in the District Court of New South Wales, the appellant was convicted by a jury of an offence that, on or about 14 February 2007, he knowingly took part in the supply of a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine. The appellant appeals against conviction. There is no appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    2 On 14 February 2007 police officers arrested a man named Ricky Thoo. During a search of the garage which Thoo had just unlocked the police found, relevantly, two sports bags each containing a number of plastic bags.  
     
      
    3 There were 55 packages of methylamphetamine in the plastic bags. Some of those packages contained other plastic bags and in total there were 72 plastic bags. The appellant’s fingerprints were found on seven bags, of which five were plastic bags which contained other plastic bags and two which did not. 
     
      
    4 The seven packages upon which the appellant’s fingerprints were found were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) Item 24 – a knotted plastic bag containing five knotted bags, with a total of 139.4 grams of methylamphetamine; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) Item 25 – a knotted plastic bag containing five knotted bags, with a total of 139.2 grams of methylamphetamine; 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) Item 26 – a knotted plastic bag containing two knotted bags, with a total of 55.9 grams of methylamphetamine; 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) Item 30 – a knotted plastic bag containing five knotted bags, with a total of 139.1 grams of methylamphetamine; 
        
       
       
        
        (v) Item 31 – a knotted plastic bag containing four knotted bags, with a total of 111.3 grams of methylamphetamine. (The appellant’s fingerprint was located on one of these plastic bags); 
        
       
       
        
        (vi) Item 34 – a knotted plastic bag containing 15 knotted bags, with a total of 420.2 grams of methylamphetamine and ephedrine; and 
        
       
       
        
        (vii) Item 35 – a knotted plastic bag which contained 19.2 grams of methylamphetamine. 
        
       
      
    5 The total amount of methylamphetamine contained within these packages was 941.13 grams. The commercial quantity applicable to methylamphetamine is 250 grams. The total amount of the methylamphetamine found in all of the bags was 1.4 kilograms. 
     
      
    6 The case against the appellant was entirely circumstantial. Indeed, there was only one circumstance, namely the presence of his fingerprint on the seven plastic bags. There was no other evidence linking him to the garage or to any other aspect of the supply of the drugs. 
     
      
    7 The issue for the jury to determine was whether this evidence was sufficient to discharge the Crown’s onus of proof. The critical factor was a judgment about the number of separate bags upon which the appellant’s fingerprints appeared. Out of the 72 bags, his fingerprints were on seven, i.e. about 10 percent. 
     
      
    8 The defence case sought to establish a reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury or, alternatively, to satisfy the test for a circumstantial case that the prosecution had not discharged its onus to exclude a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence, on the basis of proof of circumstances in which the appellant’s fingerprints could have been placed on the plastic bags. 
     
      
    9 The defence called a witness, David Brady, who had previously worked as the manager of a mobile telephone company called “Allphones”. This company was owned by Ricky Thoo. Mr Brady ceased working at the company in September 2006. He affirmed that the company was a legitimate business selling mobile telephones and accessories. He gave evidence, confirmed by others, that the appellant was a close friend of Shannon Thoo, Ricky’s brother. 
     
      
    10 Brady said that the appellant would come to the shop “to pick up repairs that needed to be done, phones or accessories”. He said that when he picked up the items for repairs they were packaged in “zip-lock or sort of shopping-style freezer bags”. He was shown Exhibit 1 (which were bags of the kind in which the drugs subject of the charge were found) and confirmed that these were the same style of bags as the ones used by Allphones. He said that he had seen the appellant touch such plastic bags in the course of his duties working for Thoo’s telephone business. 
     
      
    11 In cross-examination he affirmed that freezer bags of the kind in which the drugs were found had been used in the shop. They were contained in a plastic bag which held about 120 of the freezer bags. He also affirmed that the appellant picked up repairs for delivery and did so about two or three times per week. He also picked the items up after they had been repaired and brought them back in freezer bags. 
     
      
    12 In re-examination he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q He’d take the phones away in plastic bags? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q And he’d bring them back in plastic bags? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yes.” 
        
       
      
    13 The defence case was reinforced by cross-examination of Crown witnesses.  
     
      
    14 A police forensic officer, Detective Garry Sarksissian, gave the following evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q … it’s true, isn’t it that there is no way of telling from a surface when the print was applied? 
        
       
       
        
        A No. The only thing you can take into effect is potentially the age of the object, but you can’t tell the age of the print. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Not from the print? 
        
       
       
        
        A Not from the print. 
        
       
       
        
        Q No, if a newspaper came out today and there was a fingerprint on it and you examined it tomorrow you would be able to say how old that print was within a day? 
        
       
       
        
        A Exactly, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q But a thing like a freezer bag that you’ve got in front of you no way in the world could you say within a year when the print went on? 
        
       
       
        
        A No. If the bag was produced a year ago, sold at a certain time, if you could trace all that information then you could narrow down, but you can’t tell exactly when the print was put on there. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q The other thing that you can’t advance any opinion [on] is where the bag was when the fingerprint was applied to it? 
        
       
       
        
        A Oh no. 
        
       
       
        
        Q A third thing you can’t advance any opinion on is what was in the bag, if anything, when the print went on it? 
        
       
       
        
        A No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q The prints you found might have been applied when the bags were empty, correct? 
        
       
       
        
        A Correct.” 
        
       
      
    15 Detective Senior Constable John Guminuk gave similar evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q You agree that you can’t possibly say when Mr Hong touched the bags? 
        
       
       
        
        A I agree to that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q You agree that you can’t possibly say that the bags were not empty when he touched them? 
        
       
       
        
        A I agree to that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q You cannot say that others did not touch the bags after Mr Hong did? 
        
       
       
        
        A I agree to that.” 
        
       
      
    16 Detective Senior Constable Andrew Lam conducted extensive surveillance of the premises where the drugs were found and of Ricky Thoo. He agreed that: 
     
      
       
        There was no evidence that the appellant had “anything to do with the [premises]”. 
       
       
        None of the appellant’s fingerprints were found on any surface within the premises. 
       
       
        No DNA evidence had identified the appellant as having attended the premises. 
       
       
        No evidence of traces of drugs was found on the surfaces of the bags where the appellant’s fingerprints were found.  
       
       
        Thoo owned and ran a phone shop at the time of the offences and this was apparently a legitimate business. 
       
       
        Thoo had told police that the appellant “had nothing to do with the drugs” and also that the appellant ran errands for the telephone business and may have touched the bags in the course of that employment. 
       
      
    17 The critical facts upon which the appellant relied in this Court were as follows: 
     
      
       
        The fingerprints of the appellant could have been placed on the bags at any time up to a year prior to 14 February 2007. 
       
       
        The evidence of the fingerprint expert could not establish whether the plastic bags were empty at the time the fingerprints were placed on them. 
       
       
        The plastic bags on which the appellant’s fingerprints were found were examined for traces of methylamphetamine and found to contain none. 
       
       
        The appellant provided a DNA sample to police. However, there was no evidence of his DNA being found on the sports bags. 
       
       
        There was no evidence other than the fingerprints on the plastic bags connecting the appellant to the sports bags or anything else in the garage. 
       
       
        Thoo leased the garage in which the drugs were found. 
       
       
        Surveillance evidence did not disclose the appellant in company with Thoo or attending the garage. 
       
       
        The appellant was a friend of Thoo’s brother and had worked for Thoo at his mobile telephone business transporting telephones and accessories for repair. 
       
       
        The telephones and accessories were transported in resealable plastic bags of the same kind found by the police to contain drugs. 
       
       
        In the course of his employment the appellant had touched the same or similar plastic bags to those in which the drugs were found. 
       
       
        This had occurred around five months prior to 14 February 2007. 
       
      
    18 With respect to the third last bullet point above, the Crown has pointed out that the plastic bags in which the drugs were contained were not “resealable” bags but were “freezer” bags of the character about which Mr Brady gave evidence. 
     
      
    19 With respect to the last bullet point, the period reflects the time between Mr Brady leaving his employment at Allphones and the date of discovery of the drugs. There is no basis, however, for an inference that the appellant’s attendance at these premises had ceased. 
     
      
    20 The first ground of appeal is that the verdict is unreasonable and unable to be supported having regard to the evidence or otherwise represents a miscarriage of justice. If this ground of appeal is upheld, then this Court would quash the verdict of guilty and enter a verdict of acquittal. Four other grounds of appeal which are directed to alleged errors in the directions by the trial judge would, if upheld, lead to an order for a new trial. If the first ground is upheld it is unnecessary to deal with the other grounds. 
     
      
    21 The principles applicable to the unreasonable verdict ground of appeal are well established. The Court must ask itself whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty. (M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493; MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606 at [25], [55]-[57].) The principles have recently been summarised in Rasic v Regina [2009] NSWCCA 202 at [25], [26] and [30]. 
     
      
    22 In light of the evidence of the appellant’s contact with plastic bags on the premises, the defence case was entitled to substantial weight. The appellant did not give evidence. Nevertheless, the evidence of actual contact with the plastic bags was striking. There is a real issue as to whether, in the light of this evidence, it was open to the jury to conclude that the fingerprints were placed on the bags when they contained drugs or in the course of preparing them for use in that way. 
     
      
    23 The Court was referred to other cases in which accused persons were acquitted, notwithstanding the presence of their fingerprints on incriminating material. (R v Laing (NSWCCA, 20 June 1996, unreported); R v Zouras [2002] VSCA 182.) It was also referred to cases in which persons were convicted on the basis of the presence of fingerprints, notwithstanding the absence of other incriminating evidence. (See R v Ingivald (NSWCCA, 14 April 1989, unreported); Chahine v R [2006] NSWCCA 179 and Halmi v R [2008] NSWCCA 259.)  
     
      
    24 I do not find assistance from these authorities. Each case turns on its facts. It is not helpful to seek to compare the facts of this case with the different range of facts that arose in these other cases. 
     
      
    25 If the fingerprints had appeared on only one or two bags then I have no doubt what the answer would be. Similarly, if the fingerprints had appeared on a significant majority the bags, I have no doubt what the answer would be. The critical issue in this case is whether the fact that fingerprints appeared on seven out of 72 bags was sufficient to tip the scales and enable the Crown to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, or alternatively, to disprove the hypothesis consistent with innocence.  
     
      
    26 The Crown case was in such a narrow compass that it does not appear that anything turned on the advantage which the jury had of observing the witnesses. The only exception to this is the evidence of Brady, who was cross-examined in such a way as to suggest that his evidence about the freezer bags may not be accepted. However, it was not put to him that any of the events to which he testified never happened. 
     
      
    27 The materials available to the Court do not include the Crown submissions. However, the Crown submissions in this Court do not suggest that the jury was asked to reject Mr Brady’s evidence either in total or as to any particular, eg the frequency of the appellant’s attendance at the premises. The Crown case was to emphasise the number of different bags on which the appellant’s fingerprints appear. 
     
      
    28 In these circumstances the respect which this Court must show to the jury’s judgment is somewhat attenuated. I have less difficulty than may often be the case in applying the proposition in M v The Queen supra at 494: 
     
      
       
        
        “In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced.” 
        
       
      
    29 I have such a doubt. In my opinion, it was not open to the jury to convict the appellant. The Crown had not discharged its onus of excluding the reasonable hypothesis that the appellant’s fingerprints were placed on the plastic bags in the course of his employment. That is a hypothesis consistent with innocence. 
     
      
    30 The appellant attended the premises two to three times per week. He did so over an extended period of time. His practice was to carry equipment for repair in plastic bags and to bring back that equipment after repair in such bags. He must have touched numerous bags. The evidence, which was questioned, but not ultimately challenged in cross-examination, that bags were kept for reuse, is entitled to weight. Accordingly, it is possible that as many as seven such bags, that were ultimately used in a business of drug supply, were touched by the appellant as an employee of the legitimate business in which he was employed. 
     
      
    31 It is not necessary to deal with other grounds of appeal. However, I do wish to make some observations about the submissions on one ground.  
     
      
    32 The appellant submitted that the trial judge erred in failing to give a direction in the terms of a passage set out at [27] of the joint judgment in Mahmood v Western Australia [2008] HCA 1; (2008) 232 CLR 387. Whether or not such a direction was necessary depends on the force of that authority and the cases referred to therein. That need not be decided. 
     
      
    33 The appellant’s submissions, however, sought to reinforce this ground on the basis that the Criminal Trial Courts Bench Book had been amended to take into account the observations in Mahmood.  
     
      
    34 As this Court has said on previous occasions, the Bench Book should not be relied upon in this way. (See R v Zoef [2005] NSWCCA 268 at [93]; R v Forbes [2005] NSWCCA 377; (2005) 160 A Crim R 1 at [72]-[76].) The contents of the Bench Book are no more than suggested guidance for trial judges.  
     
      
    35 As I state in the Foreword to the Bench Book: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is a danger that publication of standard directions will convert a summing-up into a series of formulae which are not necessarily appropriate to the facts and circumstances of each particular case. For that reason, it is important to recognise that, subject to any appellate indications to the contrary, no particular form of words is required and an individual judge is free to depart from the suggested directions and to direct the jury as he or she thinks fit, provided that the directions are in accordance with the law. 
        
       
       
        
        On the other hand, the advantage of standard directions is that, properly used, they improve the efficiency of the administration of criminal justice and assist in eliminating error on the part of trial judges. The draft directions are intended to remind judges of what has to be said and to suggest a way in which it can be said. The directions are not intended to constitute an authoritative statement of the law, nor is it the case that the whole of each direction will be appropriate in each case. In all respects the directions ought be adapted to the circumstances of the individual case and the legal issues which have arisen. 
        
       
       
        
        ... 
        
       
       
        
        It is appropriate to reiterate that the  
        Bench Book  
        does not contain an authoritative statement of the law. Practitioners should not act on the basis that a failure to direct in accordance with the  
        Bench Book  
        is of itself indicative of legal error for appellate purposes. Authority for what ought have been in the contents of a direction in a particular case will need to be identified elsewhere.” 
        
       
      
    36 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
        
        1 Appeal allowed. 
        
       
       
        
        2 The conviction and sentence are quashed. 
        
       
       
        
        3 Direct a verdict of acquittal. 
        
       
      
    37 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Spigelman CJ. 
     
      
    38 GROVE J: I also agree.

       REGINA v Michael Shand WALKER 
        
       JUDGMENT 
        
       
      
    1    SPIGELMAN CJ: The Appellant was convicted by a jury of murder. He was sentenced by Sully J in the Supreme Court of New South Wales to serve a minimum term of fourteen years penal servitude, and an additional term of five years. The appeal is against his conviction. 
     
      
    2    The Appellant shot and killed a taxi driver, Wendy Bell, on 4 May 1995. At his trial, the issue was whether or not the fatal shot was the result of a deliberate act of the Appellant, with intent to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    3    In murder, the elements of a deliberate act and of an intention may be separate, but in the way the case was run below, and in this Court, those two elements overlapped considerably in terms of a defence of an accidental discharge. 
     
      
    4    In the trial below manslaughter by an unlawful dangerous act was also left to the jury. However, the jury convicted of murder. 
     
      
    5    There are two grounds of appeal. First, the Appellant submits that certain evidence of a police informer concerning alleged conversations with the Appellant should not have been admitted into evidence. Secondly, the Appellant asserts that having regard to certain matters, the verdict of guilty of murder was ""unsafe and unsatisfactory"". 
     
      
    6    On 4 May 1995, the Appellant hailed a taxi at Manly. He sat in the rear of the taxi which took him to various points in the vicinity. At one point during the course of the drive, the deceased taxi driver activated an alarm which indicated that the driver felt that she was under threat. The taxi was then in Dee Why in the vicinity of a police station. Near the police station, the revolver that the Appellant was holding wrapped in a towel discharged and the taxi driver was shot in the back. One shot was fired from the Appellant's revolver. The shot passed through the back of the taxi driver's seat and into the body of the driver. The shot fired by the Appellant was fatal. These basic facts were not in issue at the trial. The Appellant's case was that the shooting of the deceased had been accidental. It will be necessary to refer in more detail to the evidence when considering the second ground of appeal. 
     
      
    7    The first ground of appeal was that his Honour erred in admitting the evidence of the witness who was a fellow prisoner of the Appellant. The admissibility of the evidence was contested at trial. After an extensive voir dire, the trial judge admitted the conversations into evidence. Before his Honour, and in this Court, the objection was based on s90 (the unfairness discretion) and s138 (the impropriety discretion) of the Evidence Act 1995. Reliance was not placed on s137 (the unfair prejudice discretion). 
     
      
    8    There were three pertinent conversations about which the prison informer gave evidence. I will set them out as they are also material to the second ground of appeal. 
     
      
    9    The first conversation occurred prior to any contact between the prisoner and the police in the presence of a third prisoner. The evidence was: 
     
      
       
        
        ""It was a conversation amongst all of us. We were all talking and another inmate happened to say to Walker, ‘How does it feel knowing that you have killed someone?' He then said (that is to say Walker said to the other inmate), 'What's today?' And the other inmate replied, 'Its Tuesday.' He replied, 'That's how it feels.' Some time later I had a conversation with him again and he told me that the police were going down path A and which really there was a path B."" 
        
       
      
    10    According to the evidence of the prison informer it was this conversation which struck him as being cold and callous, and which gave him the idea that he could improve his own position by becoming an informer. He originally gave evidence to the effect that he had proposed to come forward out of some altruistic motive, but his Honour did not accept that evidence. The prisoner's position at that stage was that he had been arrested for a series of offences, including five armed robberies and one larceny of a motor vehicle. These offences had been committed while he was on parole from a prior conviction. The prisoner was facing a substantial sentence, something in excess of four years for the remaining period of which he was parolled for the original convictions, to which would have to be added the additional offences. 
     
      
    11    The second conversation was given in a somewhat different version in the voir dire from that which ultimately emerged before the jury. In the version that was given on the voir dire, the second conversation included the following reference: 
     
      
       
        
        ""He decided to take the woman for a dummy ride. .... 
         
        He said that 'I needed a vehicle for my scam anyway. I could plug her off anyway - I ended up driving to Warringah Medical Centre after the Mona Vale Cemetery', and I can't recall everything what he said your Honour"". 
         
         ""Yes, when I was in the cab with her, I heard her speaking on the microphone saying something like, 'I'm outside Dee Why Police Station'. I noticed a cab go past. I thought I was going to get caught, and that's when I fired the gun."" 
        
       
      
    12    The third conversation about which the prison informer gave evidence extended over approximately five pages of transcript. It is unnecessary to set out the whole of the conversation. During this conversation, the Appellant is alleged to have explained to the informer the nature of a plan he had to shoot a male taxi driver, to make it appear that it was in fact the Appellant, so that the Appellant would be able to collect something in excess of $700,000 on a life insurance policy. As will presently appear, a scheme of this general character was contained in a document found in the Appellant's possession on the night of the killing. 
     
      
    13    According to the prison informer the Appellant explained to him that he had intended to shoot a male taxi driver, disfigure his body in order to make it unrecognisable, place various items of jewellery, wallet, clothes and other items which would lead to the identification of the body as his own. He explained that he had left a will with a solicitor and appointed an “Uncle George”, who lived in Scotland, as his trustee. He anticipated that he would be able to collect monies from that uncle in due course. 
     
      
    14    With respect to the occasion on which the killing occurred, the evidence of the conversation included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Yes I asked him … ‘How come it was a female taxi driver’. He said: ‘Well I fucked up and it was supposed to be a man’. I said: ‘What happened?’ He said: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘What I done I went to a Manly taxi rank, just down the road from the police station. I seen a station wagon taxi with a male in it. That's the cab I wanted to get. As I got close to the cab, an old lady beat me to it, so I had to get the next cab. I got inside the taxi. From the outside it looked like a bloke but once I was in there I realised it was really a woman. I thought what the hell, I'm here now. I may as well take her for a dummy ride. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          I told her to take me to Mona Vale Cemetery. I had been to Mona Vale Cemetery before and checked it out. ... That's where I planned to kill the driver. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          While we driving along I had a conversation with the lady taxi driver. I told her that I hadn’t been down this way for a while. I was visiting an old relative and told her some bogus story while I was having a conversation with her. She then told me that she didn't have any family and that she knew what it was like. I then thought because she's got no family, no-one would miss her, I may as well go ahead with my scam anyway and plug her off, I've got the opportunity, with the cab now. I need a vehicle for my scam. I can always get a body somewhere else. I may as well go ahead with the scam. So I then asked her, because it has been a long time since I have been down this way, if she knew where there was a florist. … She said ""yes"" we then drove to a florist. … I went inside bought some flowers went back to the cab. We drove to Mona Vale Cemetery. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Because I knew the lay out of the cemetery, there's a dip in the road and I even checked out a headstone. From where the dip in the road is, where the headstone is, no-one would be able to see the cab. That's where I could plug her. We got to the headstone, where I directed her. I told here that I might be a bit emotional and that I would like to get a towel out of my brief case. I sat the brief case on my knees and I opened it in a way where she wouldn't be able to see it. I grabbed the yellow towel which had a gun in it. I put the flowers down and I pretended to wipe my face with a towel. I had my hand on the gun. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          As I started walking towards the cab, when I was just about to plug her, you wouldn't believe it, a fucking hearse drives past. There's this funeral going on, so I can't do her there. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          I get back in the cab and I told her that I was feeling sick and could she take me to Warringah Medical Centre. Just outside the cemetery I told her I was feeling sick and would she pull over. She pulled over. I got out of the cab and I pretended to be sick on the side of the road. I got back into the cab but this time I got in the back seat, right behind her. I told her that because I had just been sick I didn't want to breathe all over her. That's why I got in the back seat. She then drove me to Warringah Medical Centre.”’ 
          
         
        
       
      
    15    Two aspects of this particular extract were the subject of comment in the Appellant's submissions on the basis of unreliability. 
     
      
    16    First, was the reference in the passage I have just quoted to the assertion that the taxi driver had said that she didn't have any family. It was in that connection that, according to the prison informer, the Appellant had said to him, ""that's when I thought she's got no family, no-one will miss her."" This assertion was wrong. The evidence before the trial Judge on the voir dire and before the jury, was that she did have a family who would miss her. 
     
      
    17    The second aspect which was said to go to unreliability, was the reference to the hearse driving past. According to the evidence below there was no funeral at that time at that cemetery. Accordingly there could not have been a hearse driving past. 
     
      
    18    Further evidence was given about the visit to the medical centre and according to the prison informer the Appellant said that he had shown to the taxi driver his card from the Metway Bank. The evidence continued: 
     
      
       
        
        ""She was arguing about the fare and that's when he produced the Metway Card and she said that there were 'no banks around here that would take that card.' He said he cocked the hammer back of the gun and then he went on to show me how, with a towel in my cell, he had the gun wrapped in the towel. 
        
       
       
       … 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        He went on to tell me that the gun he had was a five shot ex-police revolver. 'The gun had no safety on it so I used to leave the first chamber empty. That was my safety, but once you cock the hammer back, the barrel spins and the gun is ready to go.' He said: 'I cocked the gun back and at that stage I fired, but the hammer got caught in the towel and the gun didn't go off. She then took off. 
        
       
       
        
        The next thing I know, she is out of the front of the police station and I heard her say something on the microphone in the cab that 'I'm out the front of Dee Why Police Station'. And I also seen a taxi go past too. I thought then I was gone. I was going to get caught. They'll find the gun so that's when I fired. 
        
       
       
        
        I got out of the back seat opened her front door up but I fucked up because the car was still put in drive not park, and when I tried to push her over her foot slipped on the accelerator and the car took off. I was holding onto the steering with my right hand and I was getting dragged along beside the car. I thought if I let go I would get run over. 
        
       
       
        
        The next thing we smashed into the police station and I nearly got knocked out. I broke my toe. I was trying to push her over to get into the driver's side and drive away. There was police all standing around me and then I was taken into the police station.'"" 
        
       
      
    19    In his reasons of 12 March 1998 on the admissibility of the prison informer's evidence Sully J referred to his rejection, after an earlier voir dire, of certain evidence proposed to be given by investigating police with respect to a conversation with the Appellant on 13 May 1995. His Honour had found that on that day the police had clearly understood that the conversation which had occurred with them as police officers was a conversation which the Appellant was not prepared to repeat in a formal interview, and that he was not prepared to have any formal interview until after he had spoken to and taken advice from a lawyer. 
     
      
    20    The first conversation between the prison informer and the Appellant occurred on 16 May. The police had had no involvement of any character with the prison informer with respect to this matter prior to that date. 
     
      
    21    The prison informer had contact with the police officer in charge of his own case on 17 May in which he indicated his willingness to speak to the police investigating the case involving the Appellant. On 17 May the prison informer had the second conversation to which I have referred. 
     
      
    22    On 18 May the prison informer discussed his contact with the Appellant with the investigating police of the case now before the Court. 
     
      
    23    It was on 20 May, after the prison informer had been moved into the same cell as the prisoner, that the lengthy and detailed conversation to which I have referred as the third conversation occurred. On 22 and 23 May investigating police took detailed statements from the prison informer. 
     
      
    24    Sully J noted the fact that the prison informer was at risk of having to serve in excess of four years by reason of the breaches of his parole and also was facing substantial additional sentences for the further offences that he had committed whilst on parole. He found that the prisoner was actuated by a perception that he might be able to exploit his access to the accused so as to enlist some police support for his own forthcoming sentencing. 
     
      
    25    His Honour made findings of fact as to the conduct of the investigating police officer, Inspector Byrnes, as follows: 
     
      
       
      (i) From the time of his first contact with the prisoner, Inspector Byrnes was aware that some form of assistance with the prison informer's sentencing would be involved. 
       
       
      (ii) In the letter of commendation to the District Court in connection with the prisoner's sentencing in November 1995, Inspector Byrnes had said, ""I know that he held out some hope of receiving assistance but he did not mention it ... when I became aware of the totality of the prisoner's evidence I advised his solicitor that I would provide a letter to his Honour."" (His Honour found that the expression ""held out"" was meant in the sense of ""held""). 
       
       
      (iii) He noted that at the time of first contact the prisoner ""had very little information but was confident that if Inspector Byrnes was interested he could cement a friendship with (the accused) and elicit that evidence"". 
       
       
      (iv) That Inspector Byrnes had let the prisoner know that he would definitely be interested in any information the prisoner might be able to draw out of the Appellant and if the prisoner was able to advance the police case against the accused then Inspector Byrnes would do what he could to help the prisoner, but without making any particular promises. 
       
       
      (v) Inspector Byrnes was well aware from the time of the conclusion of his meeting on 13 May with the Appellant, that the Appellant was not prepared to talk on the record until he had first seen a lawyer. 
       
       
      (vi) That as at 17 May Inspector Byrnes believed that he could not obtain judicial authorisation for the use pursuant to the  
      Listening Devices Act 
       1984 for a listening device in any attempt to record inculpatory statements made unwittingly by the accused. 
       
      
    26    These findings of fact listed as (i) to (vi) are not challenged in this appeal. 
     
      
    27    His Honour's attention was directed to the most recent authority recently delivered with respect to the various discretions at common law: The Queen v Swaffield; Pavic v The Queen (1998) 192 CLR 159. Of particular relevance to the case was the decision of Cox J in R v Pfennig (No 1) (1992) 57 SASR 507, on which the Appellant relies in this appeal, and also the decision of the English Court of Appeal in R v Bailey & Smith (1993) 97 Cr App R 365. It is the case that the decision in Pfennig bears some resemblance to the present case. His Honour's attention was not drawn to another case, that of R v Lowe [1997] 2 VR 465. 
     
      
    28    In submissions to this Court, the Appellant did not identify any wrong decision on any question of law that arose with respect to the admission of this evidence. In terms of s6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 the Appellant relies on the proposition that by reason of the admission there was a miscarriage of justice. In the case of each of s90 and s138, findings of fact must be made and discretions are reposed in the trial judge. There are well known restrictions on an appellate court reviewing findings of fact and interfering with the exercise of a discretion at first instance. 
     
      
    29    His Honour made certain findings of fact which were open to his Honour and which have not been challenged on appeal. In order to establish a miscarriage of justice within s6, the Appellant must do more than simply convince an appellate court that it may have exercised a discretion in a manner different from the way in which the judge at first instance exercised that discretion. 
     
      
    30    Section 90 is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “90 In a criminal proceeding, the court may refuse to admit evidence of an admission, or to refuse to admit the evidence to prove a particular fact, if: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) the evidence is adduced by the prosecution; and  
        
       
       
        
        (b) having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it would be unfair to a defendant to use the evidence.” 
        
       
      
    31    In submissions, Mr Agius SC, counsel for the Appellant, drew attention to particular aspects of the unreliability of the evidence of the prison informer. 
     
      
    32    Firstly, the word is used in the sense of an element of unreliability about the making of the confession itself. Secondly, there is a question of reliability that may be seen to arise as to whether or not the words, said to be a confession, were said at all. In this case a good deal of the doubt associated with the evidence is concerned with the motive of the prison informer to make up a confession. This goes to the question of the reliability of the evidence to be used to establish the confession, rather than the reliability of a confession that has been made. Many of the references in the Authorities, particularly most recently Swaffield, to which reference was made in the submissions, particularly paragraphs [16], [17], [27], [28], [36], [66] and [126], were references to reliability in the sense of reliability of a confession, rather than reliability of the evidence. 
     
      
    33    Nevertheless, there is a point about the reliability of the confession, in the context in which it was made here associated with what Kirby J referred to in the following passage in Swaffield: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Within a criminal subculture, false boasts of criminal behaviour, bravado and false accusations against others may be common and perhaps even considered necessary in certain circumstances.” [126] 
        
       
      
    34    The circumstances of each of the conversations being between prisoners gives rise to an element of unreliability in that sense. 
     
      
    35    In my opinion the decision by his Honour to find that the evidence of the admission would not be unfair to the defendant, was a finding that was open to his Honour, and not one with which I am disposed to interfere. 
     
      
    36    His Honour distinguished the case of Pfennig in which elements of the fairness discretion and elements of the s138 impropriety discretion overlapped. I will presently refer to his Honour's comments about Pfennig in the latter regard. In many respects the accused accepted the prison informer's version of the contents of the conversation, and how the conversations had come about. In his evidence, however, the accused denied that the terminology relied upon by way of admission had been used by him. 
     
      
    37    Nevertheless, there was no real dispute that the conversations were freely engaged in, and included some discussion with respect to the killing, namely, the exculpatory assertion that what had been said was to the effect that the discharge had been accidental. However, in this situation there was no evidence suggesting that the prison informer had held out any form of inducement, or made any threat, or engaged in any form of trickery with respect to engaging in the conversations. The issue was the content of the conversations. 
     
      
    38    The Appellant submitted in this Court, as he appears to have done before Sully J, that Pfennig was indistinguishable. It was submitted, as in Pfennig, the police had in fact made the prison informer their agent, and that the informal interrogation of the accused on behalf of the police would come under the same condemnation as a formal interrogation by the police would have attracted. As Cox J said in Pfennig at 514: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The police set a trap for the accused of an impermissible kind"". 
        
       
      
    39    This was said to go both to the question of unfairness in the circumstances, but, alternatively, was said to constitute an element of impropriety and also went to the balancing exercise between the undesirability of admitting evidence obtained in that way and the desirability of admitting evidence, for the purposes of s138. These aspects of police conduct were put on the basis that they went to both s90 and s138. It is convenient to treat them together. 
     
      
    40    Sully J distinguished Pfennig on a number of bases. First, he noted it was the prisoner who made the first approach to Inspector Byrnes and not vice versa. I agree that this is a material point of distinction, and at this stage it cannot be said that the ""police set a trap"", in the words of Cox J in Pfennig. Nor can it be said that the police had made the prison informer their ""agent"". This is obvious with respect to the first conversation which was of some material significance in the case and with respect to which there was no police involvement of any character. 
     
      
    41    In this case there is, in this respect, some analogy with the facts in Lowe. That case also involved conversations between two prisoners. There had been a number of such conversations between the prisoners, Lowe and Reid. Indeed Reid had acknowledged in his evidence that he had tricked Lowe into believing that he was working for a ""bent lawyer"" who would be prepared to take up Reid's case. Those conversations continued for a considerable period, prior to Reid first making contact with police. After he made contact with the police, Reid continued to speak to Lowe for the purpose of getting more information, and from time to time he would pass on that information to the police officers. Indeed, after a certain period of time, on three occasions, the police fitted Reid with a tape recorder. 
     
      
    42    The grounds of appeal were similar to the grounds in this case albeit arising under the discretions at common law. The trial judge had made the following findings of fact, which are set out by the Court of Appeal at 476. They include: 
     
      
       
        
        ""It is demonstrable that thereafter Reid encouraged Lowe to speak; it is demonstrable that Reid set Lowe up; it is demonstrable that Reid told lies and adopted stratagems towards Lowe. But the police officers did none of that. Nor did police officers cause it to be done; they did not have any control over the situation, nor did they have any sanction to operate in relation to it. It thus seems to me to be plain that it was not the police officers who were ‘effectively interviewing’ Lowe as has been submitted. Rather there were two prisoners talking voluntarily together … It seems to me, in the circumstances, that the police did nothing illegal, nor did they do anything improper by being the beneficiaries of what occurred - initially at Lowe’s instigation and which was then encouraged by Reid - in the prison.” 
        
       
      
    43    The Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Victoria, in a joint judgment of Winneke P, Brooking JA and Southwell AJA, said, at 477 to 478: 
     
      
       
        
        ""We can see no valid reason for concluding that the learned trial judge was in error in determining, as he did, that Reid was not acting as ‘an agent’ or ‘tool’ of the police in obtaining the admissions which the applicant sought to exclude. The role played by the police was a question of fact and degree which had to be determined by the trial judge upon the evidence before him and upon an evaluation of the circumstances which that evidence exposed. The belief which Reid himself might have held was not determinative of the question. The judge considered all the evidence placed before him on the voire dire and came to the view that, for relevant purposes, Reid was not acting as ‘an agent’ of the police. It is clear from the tenor of his Honour’s ruling that he was satisfied by the material before him that it was the applicant, and not Reid, who was the initiator of the conversations which occurred and that he needed little or no prompting by Reid to unburden himself. In our view his Honour was entitled to find, as he did, that this was not a case of a trap being set by police to induce a confession from a reluctant talker, but rather a case where the police were the beneficiaries of information which one prisoner was willingly giving to another. The learned trial judge was entitled to accept, as he did, the evidence of Sergeant Bartsch that no ‘coaching’ was given to Reid, and no instructions given as to questions to be asked but rather to ‘keep making conversation and see what comes’.” 
        
       
      
    44    Their Honours went on to say in a passage which I respectfully adopt at 479, 
     
      
       
        
        ""The line between what is permissible and what is impermissible might, in some cases, be a fine one. Whether such line has been crossed will, in most instances, depend upon the view of the circumstances taken by the trial judge in the particular case. The trial judge in this case was clearly not satisfied on the material before him that the police officers had crossed that line. Indeed he was, to the contrary, positively persuaded by that material that the officers had adopted a neutral role and had not, in any way, controlled the conversations between the applicant and Reid. We can discern no basis for interfering with his Honour’s conclusions.” 
        
       
      
    45    I have set out above the findings of fact that his Honour, Sully J, made with respect to the police involvement in the attaining of this evidence. In general terms, it appears to me to be of the same character as that referred to in Lowe. 
     
      
    46    In the present case, Sully J noted that there were significant limits upon police conduct in a situation such as that which faced Inspector Byrnes. But as his Honour put it: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I cannot see why within properly guarded, non specific and non contractual limits Inspector Byrnes was prevented from acknowledging what both he and the prisoner knew to be the relevant facts of life, namely, that the prisoner needed police assistance and was prepared in order to get it to run the risks inherent in giving assistance to police investigations of a murder."" 
        
       
      
    47    His Honour also contrasted the facts in Pfennig, when he found that the prisoner did not do anything to trick the accused into confiding in him. As his Honour found: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The questions asked by the prisoner so far as the evidence discloses them seem to me to have been few, non-leading and generally innocuous, except in the sense that they keep on foot a conversation in which the accused was quite willingly taking part.” 
        
       
      
    48    His Honour went on to say that he rejected the submission that the circumstances in which the prison informer drew the accused out in conversation made the statements of the accused, taken as a whole, unreliable. 
     
      
    49    He identified the fact that there was one detail given by the accused which was demonstrably incorrect, and another detail he found, at the time of the voir dire, to be arguably incorrect. His Honour went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        ""It is however in my opinion unacceptably artificial to deduce from one plain error and one other possible error occurring in the course of a very discursive narrative that the remainder of what is said is so clearly unreliable as to make it unfair to permit the entirety of the consideration to be given in evidence before the jury.” 
        
       
      
    50    The word “consideration” as appearing in that passage is, probably a reference to “conversation”. 
     
      
    51    His Honour concluded that for these reasons he had not been persuaded, on the probabilities, that he should refuse in the exercise of his discretion under s90, to admit the evidence in accordance with the submission. In my view his Honour was entitled to form that opinion. I do not see any basis upon which the Court should interfere on the exercise of this discretion. 
     
      
    52    His Honour went on to consider the parallel submission made pursuant to s138, which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “138(1) Evidence that was obtained: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) improperly or in contravention of an Australian law; or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law; 
        
       
       
        
        is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way the evidence was obtained.” 
        
       
      
    53    With respect to s138 of the Act, his Honour proceeded on the basis that the onus was upon the Appellant to establish on the balance of probabilities a relevant impropriety. If that were done then it was for the Crown to demonstrate on the balance of probabilities that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighed the undesirability of admitting the evidence that had been obtained in the way in which the evidence had been obtained. 
     
      
    54    His Honour found that the accused had not discharged its onus of establishing that the evidence was obtained improperly or in contravention or in consequence of any such impropriety or contravention. His Honour further held that, if he had found that the Appellant had discharged his onus, then he would have found that the Crown had made out its onus of establishing that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighed the undesirability of admitting evidence obtained in that way. 
     
      
    55    In this regard his Honour no doubt intended to refer to the findings of fact that I have outlined above, enumerated (i) to (vi), as the factual findings upon which he based both aspects of the judgment. When I say both aspects, I refer to the reliance placed on s90 and s138. 
     
      
    56    Both before his Honour, and in this Court, particular attention was directed to the findings of fact that his Honour made, and which his Honour numbered, and I have numbered (vi) above, namely, that at the relevant time Inspector Byrnes believed that he would not have been able to obtain approval to fit a listening device to the prison informer at the relevant time. His Honour found that this did not constitute a relevant impropriety. 
     
      
    57    The evidence adduced in cross-examination of Inspector Byrnes was to the effect that on 17 May, he had told the prison informer that he would ""weigh up what he gave me in relation to the case and I would then see what assistance could be given to him"". The Appellant submitted that this constituted a representation to the effect that the more incriminating the conversation that he was able to report, the more assistance the prison informer would receive from the police with his own sentencing matters. I do not believe that this is a reasonable construction of the evidence of Inspector Byrnes. If such a construction could be placed on the conversations then there may have been a relevant impropriety in that regard. 
     
      
    58    The finding of Sully J that both parties to the conversation, the prison informer and Inspector Byrnes, knew that some form of assistance may be forthcoming with respect to the prisoner's sentencing was an understanding which did not constitute an element of impropriety, or any contravention, or a consequence of any impropriety or contravention of law, within the meaning of s138. 
     
      
    59    I agree with Sully J that for purposes of s138, the nature of the police involvement did not constitute any impropriety or contravention in the relevant sense. I also agree with Sully J that, had I to do so, the evidence would not have convinced me, as it did not convince Sully J, that balancing the desirability of admitting evidence against the undesirability of admitting evidence obtained in that way, the discretion should be exercised in favour of refusing to admit the evidence. For those reasons I would reject ground one of the appeal. 
     
      
    60    The second ground of appeal was that the jury's verdict should be set aside as unreasonable. It was submitted that having regard to the evidence, the verdict could not be supported. An alternative formulation in the Appellant's written submissions was that the verdict was not reasonably open. 
     
      
    61    The Appellant used the terms of ""unsafe and unsatisfactory"" which have traditionally been used in this State to identify both a ground for appeal and also to found a submission that the Court should direct a verdict of acquittal, rather than an order for a new trial. As the High Court noted in Fleming v The Queen [1998] HCA 68; (1998) 73 ALJR 1; (1998) 158 ALR 379; (1998) 103 A Crim R 121 at [12], the phrase, ""unsafe and unsatisfactory"" is ""potentially confusing"". It is important, as the Appellant has done here, to direct attention to the particular terminology in s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 on which the Appellant relies. This the Appellant has done by using the particular words of s 6(1) that the verdict of the jury ""is unreasonable"". 
     
      
    62    Following the decision of the High Court in Fleming, this Court has emphasised that an Appellant should identify a ground of appeal in the terms of the statute (see R v Giam [1999] NSWCCA 53; (1999) 104 A Crim R 416 especially at [43] to [44]). The other work hitherto done by the “unsafe and unsatisfactory” ground of appeal should be the subject of a separate heading in submissions with respect to the order sought. In many cases the orders sought under what was referred to as the unsafe and unsatisfactory ground, is a verdict of acquittal. Attention does need to be directed to the inter-relationship between subs 6(2) and subs 8(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. (See R v Johnston (1998) 45 NSWLR 362 especially at 380; R v Giam supra at [31]-[46], R v Brownlee [1999] NSWCCA 57; (1999) 105 A Crim R 214 at [31]-[34]. 
     
      
    63    In many cases the order sought is the verdict of acquittal which is the default order under s6(2). In the present case, the Appellant's position was to seek the Court to substitute the alternative verdict of manslaughter. 
     
      
    64    The relevant test with respect to the “unsafe and unsatisfactory” ground is still that articulated by the majority of the High Court in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493: 
     
      
       
        
        ""... the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty."" 
        
       
      
    65    This remains the test notwithstanding the abandonment of the phrase ""unsafe and unsatisfactory"". See Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 at 450-452. The reasoning of the High Court in M at 493-494 remains appropriate when determining whether the verdict of a jury should be set aside ""on the ground that it is unreasonable"" within s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act. See also Jones v The Queen supra at 450-452. 
     
      
    66    The basic submission of the Appellant in this regard was that the Crown had not negated the likelihood that the shooting was an accident. It was submitted that there was evidence as to the operation of the revolver to the effect that there was a possibility that a cylinder might locate itself in a position different from that intended by the handler. Particular reliance was placed on the types and quantity of drugs that had been prescribed for the Appellant and the expert evidence as to the possible effects of those drugs. 
     
      
    67    Particular emphasis was given to the absence of a motive for the killing. There was a body of evidence with respect to the insurance fraud which the Appellant had planned, but the sex of the intended deceased was a crucial part of that plan. It was submitted that there was no basis for a conclusion of an intent to kill a woman. Mr Agius acknowledged that motive was not a necessary element of an offence, however, he submitted, that where the defence relied on accident, the absence of a motive was of significance. 
     
      
    68    The basic issue at the trial and on this appeal was whether or not the fatal shot was caused by some deliberate act of the accused or with the requisite intention. It is pertinent to outline the relevant evidence on the issue of intent. 
     
      
    69    It was common ground that at some point of time the Appellant had a plan to murder a taxi driver in aid of a plan to defraud an insurance company. The idea was to disfigure the body and also to plant various matters on the body which would tend to identify it as that of the Appellant. Indeed, in the briefcase which the Appellant had with him on the night of the killing, there was a document, that became Exhibit U in the proceedings, that set out in great detail the various steps which the Appellant proposed to take in pursuance of this plan. 
     
      
    70    In the period up to 21 April, the Appellant had bought the gun, had changed his will, had left requisite documents with his solicitor. At the time after his arrest there was found in his room a mallet, a machete, hand cutter and surgical gloves which were relevant to the proposal to disfigure a body. 
     
      
    71    Of course, it was an essential component of this plan that the taxi driver be male. The circumstance that the Appellant happened to encounter a woman taxi driver was relied upon by the Appellant as inconsistent with the implementation of the planned murder. The Crown case, however, was that the original intention having been foiled, the Appellant had formed the intent to carry out the killing in some way as a ""dummy run"" for the plan itself. 
     
      
    72    The Appellant's case was that he had abandoned the plan some considerable time before, and indeed before 21 April. However, on 21 April he bought the gun and he also left the relevant documents with his solicitors including sealed instructions as what to do upon his death. Nevertheless, he maintained a position that he had abandoned the plan some time prior to this date. All of this was before the jury for the purposes of assessment. Given the acts of 21 April, and his possession on the night in question of the check list that became Exhibit U, and also his possession at that time of relevant equipment, it was plainly open to the jury to decide that as at 4 May, when the killing occurred, he was pursuing this particular plan. He had made some attempts in his evidence to explain his conduct in this regard. 
     
      
    73    However, apart from it being open to the jury to reject his version in the case, there is the second aspect of the evidence on which the Crown relied. Certain admissions had been made to the police. Some occurred prior to the formal record of interview. Others are contained in the records of interview. The evidence was not entirely clear as to the extent to which the Appellant confessed in the conversation prior to the record of interview. 
     
      
    74    The Inspector's evidence included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I said, ‘I saw a hole through the driver's seat of the taxi. Did you shoot the female taxi driver through the back of the driver's seat?' The accused appeared sullen and he paused and then he said 'Yes'. He also acknowledged with a nod of his head and he raised his right hand up to about abdomen height, extended his right hand with his fingers in that fashion appearing to emulate the gun."" 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      and 
       
        
        ""As he did this he said 'Initially I hadn't intend to fire the gun but then I did and I don't know why I did it.'"" 
        
       
      
    75    The evidence as to how the Appellant raised his hand and emulated a gun at about abdomen height is, of course, inconsistent with the evidence that he gave and to which I will presently refer as to the circumstances of the allegedly accidental discharge of the weapon. 
     
      
    76    In the first record of interview the questions and answers that occurred, to which I have just referred in the evidence of Inspector Burns, were referred to in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Do you agree that you also told me that initially you hadn't intended to fire the gun? 
         
        A. Correct. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. And you went, do you agree, that you went on to say that you had fired the gun and you don't know why you did it? 
         
        A. ...my hand, my finger, I think she moved forward slightly in the traffic, I think my finger slipped, no, I, there was no intention to fire the weapon. I was simply trying to keep it out of her sight while I got my wallet. Yes, I agree with what I said to you earlier."" 
        
       
      
    77    In the course of the first record of interview the following question and answer occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. What happened when you got to the set of lights just on the intersection of St Davids Avenue and Fisher Road?"" 
        
       
       
      and I am omitting certain parts, 
       
        
        ""A. I asked her to...find me a...teller machine so that I could use my auto keycard...because I noted she didn't have one in the car, a lot of the Manly taxis do. And...while I was fumbling around, cause as I say I have these dizzy spells and...hence why I don't carry anything in my pockets...and I was searching in my case for my keycard and...told her I needed a State Bank or a St George, cause I have a Queensland account but it works at various other banks and she said there would be one at the Mall...so I was just fumbling around in that. I tried to move the towel with the revolver in it...'cause it was in the way of me closing it and it...went off."" 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      Subsequently in the record of interview he said: 
       
        
        ""I had it by the butt and my finger on the gun, not on the trigger, and I know it was only a few minutes ago but it seems you know it happened so fast...the gun was cocked albeit empty chamber so ...no it was. I think there was but I had my finger not on the trigger on the shield in front of the trigger the curved bit while I was, yeah, I really wasn't paying attention to this hand. I was paying attention to getting my wallet and stuff out."" 
        
       
      
    78    He was asked about the conversation prior to the shooting and the Appellant said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""We've been chatting about a couple of things, she was telling me when she was gunna knock off, she was gunna go down to the club and um I said I had to get the scripts filled and I'd be going back home to rest and ‘cause I wasn't feeling the greatest...certainly then we were having a normal conv, as I said, that's why I moved over ah...so I could hear her better cause of the...my bad hearing and...I did I got closer to her."" 
        
       
      
    79    The following also transpired in the first record of interview: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Did you have any arguments or...disagreements? 
         
        A. Oh, no. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. ...with her...? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. During the course of your trip? 
         
        A. No, she was a very congenial...kind of person."" 
        
       
      
    80    The Appellant also gave evidence that he was holding the firearm in the towel on his lap so that it wouldn't fall while he was getting his keycard. He also said the following in response to questions as to whether or not he pulled the trigger. 
     
      
       
        
        ""I pulled it but I don't remember it as a conscious act. I didn't turn around and point it at her and, and take it out of its covering or... no, I didn't, there was no forethought there, if that's..."" 
        
       
      
    81    The evidence as to admissions had to be assessed by the jury in a context in which there was a body of uncontested evidence about the events immediately prior to the killing. The killing occurred about twenty minutes past midday. Evidence about the period of five to ten minutes before that moment was available to the jury for it to consider. This included the following. 
     
      
    82    The deceased activated an alarm from the taxi to her base, known as a M13 alarm. This was described as the “ultimate alarm” that a driver would press “if they felt they were in trouble” (T36). The effect of that alarm is to open up the microphone in the taxi so that the radio room supervisor can hear what is occurring.83    On this occasion the radio room supervisor first heard “quiet voices in the car”. The radio room supervisor then placed a call to the taxi about which she gave the following evidence: 
     
      
       
        
         ""'Taxi 1654, do you have an M13 situation?' She said 'No'. Then she said 'Yes'. I said 'Where are you?' She told me 'the corner of Warringah and Pittwater Road.' I said 'Which direction are you heading?' She said 'I am trying to get to Dee Why Police Station.'"" 
        
       
      
    84    The radio room supervisor said, in answer to a question about what sort of voice the deceased had: ""very quiet, very unlike her"". 
     
      
    85    According to two witnesses in the radio room, it was at this point that the deceased started to scream for help. According to one witness: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I heard her say before she screamed that she didn't need the situation, she didn't want the situation. I really can't remember the words she used but the situation, she didn't need it."" 
        
       
      
    86    Evidence was given that when an M13 alarm is sounded, this opens a clear channel to other taxis so that they can also hear what is happening inside the taxi. There is also evidence that it was common practice for a driver who had activated an M13 alarm to also put on hazard lights whilst driving. Another taxi driver gave evidence that the deceased's taxi was weaving in and out of traffic with its hazard lights on, at about that time. 
     
      
    87    The M13 alarm, the use of the hazard lights, the weaving in and out of traffic at some speed, about which there was evidence, and the particular conversation immediately before the scream to the effect that she “did not need the situation”, or words of that character, indicate a level of fear on the part of the taxi driver that is not consistent with the nature of the Appellant's case as to a discussion concerning an ability to pay with a particular form of card. 
     
      
    88    This was all evidence before the jury available for it to assess the evidence of the Appellant and also the other confessional evidence both in the conversation with the police and in conversation with the police informer. 
     
      
    89    In my view the assessment of that body of evidence was a matter for the jury. There was evidence upon which the jury could reasonably convict. 
     
      
    90    The Appellant also relied, in his submissions in this Court, on evidence concerning the possibility with respect to the mechanism of the particular firearm, i.e., that the cylinder with a live round in it could have located itself in a position other than that intended by the Appellant. The Appellant's case was that, as some kind of safety measure, he loaded the five-shot revolver with only four live rounds. His intent was that the empty cylinder would be located in line with the hammer. There was evidence to the effect that the operation of the revolver could act in such a way as to locate this cylinder in a manner other than that intended. It was a matter to be assessed by the jury in coming to its own conclusion as to the deliberate quality of the act and the intent with which the act was performed. Whether the accused's evidence as to how he loaded the gun should be accepted was a matter for the jury. 
     
      
    91    There was a body of evidence as to the accused's medical condition and practice with respect to prescription drugs. There was evidence from Dr Hornibrook, an ophthalmologist, who treated the Appellant for double vision. The Appellant placed particular reliance on the extraordinary variety of drugs he was taking at the time. 
     
      
    92    There was evidence from a treating doctor, an independent expert and a pharmacist about the scale of drug taking and the effects of the particular drugs and their combination. This evidence was clearly and accurately summarised for the jury in Sully J’s summing-up. No criticism has been directed to any part of that summing-up. 
     
      
    93    Much of the evidence was of a theoretical character, namely, what kind of effect could this habit of drug usage have on a person's ability to perform a deliberate act or to form the requisite intent. 
     
      
    94    As appeared during the course of the trial, and was clearly indicated in the summing-up, the jury had a particular form of evidence which it could use to assess the applicability of this theoretical evidence in the circumstances of this particular case. I refer to the first electronically recorded interview. Within forty minutes of the relevant incident a video recording was made of the Appellant. This video recording is of significance for the assessment of the expert evidence. In particular, both the treating doctor, Dr Nelson, and the independent expert, Professor Starmer, were asked questions based on the appearance of the Appellant in the video. Both agreed that they could not see evidence of confusion. 
     
      
    95    This, of course, was also a matter which the jury could observe for itself. 
     
      
    96    Professor Starmer did not see the three videos in full, as the jury did. The issue of whether or not the drug taking by the Appellant was of such a character as to mean that the Crown had not negated the likelihood that the shooting was an accident was quintessentially a jury question. It was left to the jury in a manner which the Appellant does not criticise in terms of the summing-up, some of which I have outlined above. 
     
      
    97    In my view there was evidence before the jury, including the evidence of the prison informer, notwithstanding the attack on the reliability of that evidence. I should note, additionally, no challenge has been made to the direction the trial judge gave with respect to the way the jury should approach the evidence of the prison informer. 
     
      
    98    The second count on the appeal, that the jury verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory, in my view should be rejected. 
     
      
    99    In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    100    IRELAND J: I agree. 
     
      
    101    SIMPSON J: I also agree. 
     
      
    102    SPIGELMAN CJ: The appeal is dismissed.

    THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOURT OF APPEAL CA 40075/00 MASON P MEAGHER JA GILES JA Friday, July 20 2001 
      
      BELINDA GRAHAM v THE STATE OF NEW SOUTH WALES 
      
      
      JUDGMENT 
      
     1   MEAGHER JA: The Appellant/Plaintiff, Miss Graham is a young lady in her mid-twenties who suffered severe injuries when she was crossing Carlisle Avenue, Dharruk, on 22 February 1988 when she was hit by a motor vehicle. She was then aged twelve years, having been born on 19 June 1975. She was returning from school, that is Mount Druitt High School, which she had attended for about three weeks. She was then in Year Seven. Up till this time she had been in a number of schools; Ashfield Infants School, Hebersham Infants School, Whalan Public School. She was a disadvantaged child, suffering from impaired eyesight and bad balance, the latter condition being possibly related to the former.  
     2   Her mother, with whom she resided, lived about one kilometre from the school. To walk to and from school involved crossing Carlisle Street, the only heavily trafficked street between her home and the school. Normally on her way to school her mother would walk her to Carlisle Street and then allowed her to walk the rest of the way unaccompanied. On her way home her mother usually met her at Carlisle Street and walked her home.  
     3   On the day of the accident her mother was apparently running late, or perhaps the plaintiff was arriving early, and she tried to cross Carlisle Street without assistance. It was at this point that the accident occurred. She sued the defendant, the State of New South Wales, because of the school’s failure to transport her either by bus or by taxi to her home. There was no doubt that the school knew of her afflictions, that it knew it was dangerous for her to walk across Carlisle Street, that it knew that an accident might well occur unless she was greatly helped to get home. It knew that at her previous schools she went home on a school bus. It knew that Miss Graham’s mother had requested transport to be made available for her on the way home. The school knew that the mother’s request had been supported by a doctor. Nevertheless, for reasons of its own, the respondent discontinued the school bus towards the beginning of 1988 and had notified Miss Graham’s mother accordingly.  
     4   In these circumstances Patten DCJ, whilst having the greatest of sympathy for the plaintiff, was of the view that her case against the State had to fail. It would be impossible not to share his Honour’s sympathy. I find it also impossible to see that his Honour was incorrect, and in my view this appeal must fail. 
     5   This is so, in my opinion, because the common law in general imposes no prima facie duty to prevent another person from loss or injury. There are exceptions to that principle but none of them is relevant here. This is probably another way of saying in situations like the present there is no proximity between the plaintiff and the defendant. No doubt the school had a duty to take reasonable steps to protect the child whilst it was at school, and this it apparently did. There may also have been a duty to inform Miss Graham’s parents that neither taxi nor bus was running, and this it certainly did. There is no duty, in my opinion, to go further to take precautions to escort a pupil like Miss Graham to her home. Except in exceptional circumstances the master/pupil relationship ceases to exist at the school boundary. For these reasons, in my view, the appeal should be dismissed with costs. 
     6   MASON P: I agree.  
     7   Counsel for the appellant took us to passages in Trustees of the Roman Catholic Church for the Diocese of Bathurst v Koffman (1996) ATR 81-399. The judgments indicate that the content of the duty which a school authority owes to a pupil may be affected by the particular circumstances of the pupil or of the vicinity of the school. There will be some situations where the duty extends beyond the school gate, at least so far as enlivening some obligation to give a particular warning to parents or sometimes to effect some added supervision.  
     8   In my view this case falls very clearly on the wrong side of the line as far as the appellant is concerned. The fact that she was twelve, in high school, that the school made plain to her and her parents that the request for transport to and from school was declined, and the general arrangements that were in place for the appellant to walk to and from school all indicate that, whatever the scope of the duty, it was not breached in the present case.  
     9   The appellant sought to gain some comfort from the fact that, following the accident, there was an arrangement made for transport for this particular pupil. I think the fact of the event occurring afterwards shows that transport could have been provided, that in itself is a self-evident proposition. It doesn’t really do anything, on the facts of this case, to assist the plaintiff in showing that the considered decision not to make available this added form of protection was one which was unreasonable in the circumstances. I agree with the orders proposed. 
     10   GILES JA: I agree with both judgments. In short, the State as educational authority owed a duty of care to the appellant as pupil, and the question was, in the particular circumstances of a twelve year-old girl with the disabilities from which the appellant suffered and with the history of the schooling recounted by Meagher JA, whether the content of the duty was such that the State was required to provide bus or taxi transport from the school to the appellant’s home in order to protect her from harm when crossing Carlisle Avenue. In my opinion it was not, and the duty was sufficiently discharged by making known to the appellant’s mother that such transport would not be provided so that the appellant’s mother could herself take such steps as were considered appropriate to see the appellant across Carlisle Avenue, as she generally did but on this occasion for whatever reason, was unable to do. I agree with the orders proposed. 
     11   MASON P: The appeal is dismissed with costs.

      Judgment 
      
      
       
     1 Dunford J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the sentences imposed by the late Acting Judge Ford QC in the District Court at Campbelltown on 6 April 2000, following the Applicant’s pleas of guilty before the Magistrate and committal for sentence pursuant to s 51A of the Justices Act 1902.  
      
       
     2 The charges were two counts of robbery in company contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 which carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 20 years, one count of robbery contrary to s 94 of the Crimes Act which carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 14 years, and one count of use offensive weapon to prevent lawful apprehension contrary to s 33B(a) of the Crimes Act which carries a maximum penalty of 12 years. There was also a matter on the Form 1 of resisting a police officer in the execution of his duty. 
      
       
     3 The two robberies in company were committed on 27 April and 25 May 1999, both at the Caltex Service Station at Minto. The robbery was at the Five Star Supermarket at Bradbury on 18 July 1999 and the use of the offensive weapon to prevent lawful apprehension occurred later that same day when the Applicant was chased and caught following the robbery.  
      
       
     4 The facts of various matters were as follows. On Tuesday 27 April 1999 at about 12.10 am the console operator at Minto Caltex Service Station saw three males walking towards the store, one of whom was the Applicant. They entered the store and after a time the console operator walked over to serve the Applicant and the other male, and when he did so he found that the third male had climbed under the counter and was holding a knife approximately 15cm in length in his right hand. He waved the knife in front of the console operator and ordered him to open the till draw. The console operator did so, whereupon the Applicant jumped up onto the counter on his knees and removed the cash from the register. The amount was estimated at $520. The Applicant and the other two males then ran from the store. 
      
       
     5 On 25 May 1999 at about 5.15 am the same console operator was working in the same service station when he saw the Applicant and another male enter the service station. He was requested to call a taxi and walked over to the phone within the service area and attempted to do so. While doing so he had his back turned to the Applicant and the other male when he heard the buttons to the cash register being pushed. He turned around to see the Applicant kneeling on the counter on his knees with a knife approximately 15cm in length in his right hand. He put the phone down and walked toward the Applicant who pointed the knife towards him whereupon he retreated. The Applicant opened the cash register and removed the cash notes from inside, taking an estimated $470. The other male was standing next to the Applicant on the other side of the counter and ordered the console operator to hand over his wallet. He had $10 in his wallet which he handed over to the other male. Both of them then left the store. The console operator was able to identify the Applicant as the person who had committed the robbery one month earlier, and he was later identified from video footage in relation to these robberies.  
      
       
     6 On 3 August after being arrested for the other matters, the Applicant viewed the surveillance video footage of these robberies and identified himself to police as the person depicted making full admissions. He stated that the offences had been committed to support his drug addiction. 
      
       
     7 On Sunday, 18 July 1999 at about 2.50pm the Applicant went to the Five Star Supermarket at Bradbury at the shopping centre and when passing over payment for a packet of chewing gum he reached over the counter, pushed the check-out operator away, reached into the till and took $220 in cash from the cash register. He then ran from the store. The check-out operator raised the alarm, the store owner gave chase and after some time was joined in the pursuit by another member of the public. The Applicant turned around and confronted the two pursuers saying “I have a blood filled needle and Hep C and I’ll stab you if you come near me”.  
      
       
     8 The Applicant then ran down the road continuing to be pursued by the storeowner and the other person. At about this time another male joined in the chase and gave assistance. The three of them managed to apprehend the Applicant, a struggle ensued and at this stage the Applicant produced a hypodermic syringe which he held in his right hand and said, “I have a needle I have Hep C I’ll stab you with it I’ve got a broken arm let me go”. He continued to make threats towards his captors whilst they waited for the police to arrive.  
      
       
     9 When police did arrive they saw the Applicant holding a syringe in his right hand. They directed the Applicant to release the syringe on a number of occasions which he refused to do. Police joined in the struggle and eventually the syringe was prised free from the Applicant’s grasp. The Applicant was arrested and participated in an electronically recorded interview admitting the robbery and again stated that the reason for committing the offence was to support his heroin addiction and that he had been addicted to heroin for 7 years, using every other day. 
      
       
     10 The Applicant was born on 14 December 1975, he was therefore aged 23½ years at the time of the offences and 24½ years at the time of sentencing. According to the Pre-Sentence Report he was the eldest of four children from a close and supportive family. However, on reaching adolescence he began associating with a delinquent peer group, leading to anti-social behaviour and eventual entry into Boys Town as a boarder at the age of 14. The family remained supportive but frustrated with his continuing drug problem. He was educated to Year 10 and he and his partner of 6 years, who also remains supportive, have three children who were at the time of sentencing aged 6, 4 and 1 respectively. The Applicant has not worked since 1997. 
      
       
     11 He has an extensive criminal record dating back to 1992 when he was aged 16. His convictions include larceny, break enter and steal, obtain benefit by deception, robbery, malicious damage, possess prohibited drug and drive in a manner dangerous. Following successful appeals to the District Court he was on 29 May 1998 effectively sentenced to a minimum term of 3 months to date from 24 March 1998 with an additional term of 5 months. According to the Pre-sentence Report he was released on parole on 24 June 1998 with his parole order due to expire 23 November 1998. Due to his failure to abide by his parole conditions and drug abuse his parole was revoked as from 11 July 1998, but he was re-paroled on 13 October 1998 with a further parole condition to enter the Odyssey House Drug Rehabilitation Program. He failed to do so, his parole was again revoked on 23 October 1988, he was returned to custody on 1 November 1998 and served the remainder of his term and also a further sentence of 2 months to date from 31 October 1998 for shoplifting and enter enclosed land. He was finally released from custody on 24 January 1999 and the first of these offences were committed approximately 3 months later.  
      
       
     12 It appears that he began using cannabis at about age 13 and at age 18 he began experimenting with heroin. Following a motor vehicle accident in 1995 his use of this substance increased dramatically due to his inability to work and boredom. He was briefly admitted to a Methadone Program in 1996 but discharged after 3 weeks. He has also been using Rohypnol since age 11. He stated that prior to his incarceration he was using up to 3 grams of heroin a day as well as taking 20 tablets of Rohypnol. Since his incarceration he has been admitted to the Methadone Program admittedly on 120 milligrams a day and at the time of sentencing was withdrawing from methadone and was in receipt of 90 milligrams a day. He told Dr Westmore the heroin might cost him up to $600 a day.  
      
       
     13 Dr Westmore was of the opinion that he had a significant and long term substance abuse problem and probably in addition some personality difficulties with possibly anxious and dependent traits, but he did not consider that he had a anti-social personality disorder. He considered that he required an extended period of rehabilitation from a psychiatric perspective and it would be best if some or all of this were in a community-based situation. Dr Westmore considered his prognosis very uncertain as he had not had any extended rehabilitation in the past and his drug misuse history was quite chronic. 
      
       
     14 His Honour took all these matters into account and then imposed sentences expressed as follows:  
      
       
       1. for the robberies in company at the service station on 27 April and 25 May 1999, imprisonment for 3 years, the sentences to be served concurrently.  
        
       2. for the robbery at the supermarket in Bradbury on 18 July 1999, imprisonment for 2 years to be served concurrently with the other sentences already imposed. 
        
       3. for using the offensive weapon to prevent lawful apprehension a consecutive or cumulative term of 2 years. His Honour went on saying: 
        
         
          
           
           “And in your case the non-parole period will be, having regard to the cumulative sentence, a period of 5 years.” 
           
          
         
        
       
     15 His Honour backdated the commencement of the 5 years to 18 July 1999, the date on which the Applicant had been taken into custody. He found “special circumstances” in the need for a protracted period of supervision for rehabilitation and went on:  
      
       
        
         
         “the period to be served after the non-parole periods a term of 3 years and the whole of the term of the sentence will expire on 17 July 2007”. 
         
        
       
     16 His Honour therefore clearly had in mind that the Applicant should serve a total of 5 years in gaol before being eligible for parole and that thereafter there be a further period of 3 years during which he would be eligible for parole. 
      
       
     17 An initial problem arises because of the manner in which the sentences were expressed. Under the Sentencing Act 1989 s 5, the Judge was required to first set a minimum term of imprisonment that the person was required to serve for the offence and secondly to set an additional term during which the person could be released on parole. Although s 6 permitted the setting of fixed terms in specified circumstances, one of which was because of other sentences imposed on the offender, when he did so the Court was required to state the reason for its decision to set a fixed term.  
      
       
     18 That Act had however been repealed and replaced by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 as from 3 April 2000, 3 days before the Applicant was sentenced. That Act requires that when sentencing an offender to imprisonment the Court is required; firstly, to set the total term of the sentence and then, to set a non-parole period (i.e. the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence): s 44, R v Carrion [2000] NSWCCA 191, 49 NSWLR 149 at para [15].  
      
       
     19 Section 45 authorises a Court to decline to set a non-parole period in various circumstances including because of any other penalty previously imposed on the offender, for any other reason that the Court considers sufficient. Subsection (2) provides that if the Court declines to set a non-parole period it must make a record of its reasons for doing so but subs (4) further provides that the failure to do so does not invalidate the sentence. In my opinion it is apparent that his Honour’s reason for not fixing non-parole periods in respect of the three robbery offences was that his Honour was intending to allow for the Applicant’s release on parole by fixing a non-parole period in respect of the other matter. It would have been more appropriate and more correct to have fixed the sentence with the non-parole period first so that the omission to fix non-parole periods for the other sentences could be brought under s 45(1)(b) rather than s 45(1)(c) but subs(4) prevents the sentence being invalid in that regard. 
      
       
     20 But his Honour clearly failed to comply with s 44(1) by fixing a non-parole period first and then a further period, described as the “parole period”, to make up the whole of the sentence. There is no such thing in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act as a “parole period” as there was an “additional term” in the Sentencing Act, although for the sake of convenience, that expression is often used. 
      
       
     21 His Honour quite clearly intended that the robbery offences between them should carry concurrent sentences of 3 and 2 years respectively without any non-parole periods and that the offence of using an offensive weapon to avoid lawful apprehension should carry a further sentence, cumulative on the robbery sentences, of 5 years with a non-parole period of 2 years giving rise to an effective overall sentence of 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years. As I say, his Honour failed to comply with s 44(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act by fixing the non-parole period first, but in my opinion this Court has ample power to readjust the sentences pursuant to s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and/or s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to rectify any errors in the manner the sentences were expressed; and the real question for this Court is whether a total sentence of 8 years with a non-parole period of 3 years is outside the range of a proper sentencing discretion for the offences to which the Applicant pleaded guilty. 
      
       
     22 The charges of robbery in company and armed robbery are both offences contrary to s 97(1) and both carry a maximum penalty of 20 years; therefore, although not strictly applicable, R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111, 46 NSWLR 346 provides a useful guide. That case takes account of pleas of guilty, although an early plea, as was the case here, will justify a larger discount: R v Thomson [2000] NSWCCA 309, 49 NSWLR 383. On the other hand here there were not only the two robberies in company, quite separate offences committed 4 weeks apart, but another robbery some 8 weeks later, followed by the use of the offensive weapon to prevent lawful apprehension. These two latter offences were committed on the same day and one followed the other, but they were in fact separate and discrete offences of a different nature; and so each of those four offences justified a cumulative sentence. It was of course necessary to have regard to the principle of totality but by the Judge making all the robbery sentences concurrent, the Applicant received a substantial benefit.  
      
       
     23 In addition to that, the Applicant had a bad criminal record, including previous convictions for robbery and break, enter and steal. Some factors of the offence were matters of aggravation such as the fact that the service station was robbed at night when the console operator was particularly vulnerable, and the threat of the HIV virus was of particular apprehension to a number of people: see R v Stone (1995) 85 A Crim R 436 at 439 where Sully J said: 
      
       
        
         
         “I think that it has to be understood that, whether rightly or wrongly, many, many people of good sense and good will, who are normally able to exercise reasonable, sensible, discriminating judgments have a deeply rooted, absolutely convinced, and almost boundless, terror of AIDS and of the HIV virus. It is not to the point, it seems to me, to debate, in a detailed kind of way, whether it is logical for such people to entertain such fears. The nature of the disease, its apparent incurability, the appalling consequences that it has to the lives of people who are infected with it, all have produced among decent, upright, law-abiding citizens a genuine terror of, and indeed revulsion towards, the disease.  
          
         That environment creates, as this case itself demonstrates, an opportunity for those who are disposed to take advantage of it, to exploit those terrors and apprehensions of their fellow citizens in the commission of crimes of one kind or another. It simply cannot be permitted to continue; and if, in order to stamp it out, condign sentences have to be imposed at the primary sentencing level, and upheld on appeal, then, whether fashionable or not, that is what will have to be done.” 
         
        
       
     24 Reference was made to the Applicant’s drug addiction and we were referred to the principles relating to the effect of drug addiction in relation to charges such as the present contained in the judgment of Wood CJ at CL in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111, 46 NSWR 346 at para [273]. Reference was made to the Applicant’s drug addiction, this is not an excuse or a mitigating factor of itself although it can be, and in this case is, a subjective factor which tends to explain the Applicant’s reason for committing the offences, their impulsiveness and, particularly in relation to the Bradbury matter, the lack of pre-planning. It is also relevant in considering his prospects of rehabilitation, which in view of his past history, are not particularly encouraging. It was also necessary in considering the sentences to be imposed for his Honour to make some allowance for the additional matter he was taking into account in the Form 1, see R v Morgan (1993) 78 A Crim R 368 at 371-2, Hunt CJ at CL, R v Barton [2001] NSWCCA 63 at paras [54]-[64] per Carruthers AJ and cases there cited. 
      
       
     25 Taking all these matters into account I am of the opinion that the total sentences imposed in the present case were not outside the proper range of a valid sentencing discretion; but because his Honour failed to have regard to the provisions of the new Act it is necessary to re-sentence the Applicant. In doing so the Court can have regard to matters that have occurred since the original sentence was imposed. Generally these are matters relating to the Applicant’s conduct and attempts at rehabilitation whilst in gaol, but in the present case there are subsequent convictions, namely escape from lawful custody, and shoplifting; and it is conceded that the Court can have regard to these matters.  
      
       
     26 Notwithstanding that, I would not increase the effective sentences but our attention has been drawn to the fact that the Applicant was at liberty for 49 days following his escape. In the normal course, if the appeal was simply dismissed, this period of 49 days (street time) would be added onto the end of his current sentence, but there appears to be considerable doubt as to whether it would be added on if we simply backdated the sentences to the original commencing date and it is conceded that it would not be inappropriate to advance the commencement date of the sentences by 49 days and make it clear that in doing so we have taken account of the time the Applicant has been at liberty since the original sentences were imposed.  
      
       
     27 I therefore propose the following orders: Grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal, quash the sentences imposed and re-sentence the Applicant as follows: 
      
       
       In respect of each of the robberies in company imprisonment for 3 years, the sentences to be concurrent and be deemed to have commenced on 2 September 1999. In respect of the robbery at Bradbury and taking into account the matter on the Form 1 and in respect of the use of an offensive weapon to prevent apprehension, imprisonment for 5 years to commence on 2 September 2002, such sentences to be concurrent with each other but cumulative to the sentences imposed in respect of the service station robberies. In respect of these last mentioned offences I would fix a non-parole period of 2 years so that the earliest date on which the Applicant would be eligible for release on parole would be 1 September 2004. I would have it noted “street time” of 49 days following the Applicant’s escape from lawful custody has been taken into account in fixing the commencement dates of the sentences for the robberies as 2 September 1999 rather than 18 July 1999, the date on which the Applicant was taken into custody. 
        
       
     28 Carruthers AJ: I agree with Dunford J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SULLY, J: Justice Greg James will give the first judgment. 
     
      
    2 GREG JAMES, J: This is an appeal against his convictions brought by an appellant who stood trial in the District Court of New South Wales before Judge Moore and a jury in late May and early June 2000. The appellant was convicted on six counts alleging sexual offences against the same complainant. Those counts alleged the commission of those sexual offences during several years in the early 1960s. 
     
      
    3 There is also an application for leave to appeal against sentences imposed by Puckeridge DCJ. following pleas of guilty to two further offences, which sentences were made cumulative on those imposed by Moore, DCJ. In both cases leave to appeal out of time is necessary. 
     
      
    4 The complainant came forward to the police in respect of those matters after his marriage had broken up and he had remarried. He first spoke to police officers and provided them with a statement in March 1997. This was over 30 years after the events. When he came forward he was recalling events which had taken place when he was between the ages of 13 and 17, he at that time was about 52 years of age. The appellant was said to have been between 25 and 29 at the time at which these events occurred and was 65 at the time of the trial. 
     
      
    5 Thirty seven years had elapsed between the time of the first alleged offence and the time of the making of the statement to the police about it. At the trial it is common ground that the directions the learned trial judge gave to the jury did not accord with the requirements this court and the High Court of Australia had enunciated in many decisions as necessary to ensure a fair trial where such a delay has occurred. 
     
      
    6 It was conceded in the Crown's submissions that the first of the grounds of appeal put forward on this appeal should be made out. That ground reads as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        ""The trial miscarried as a result of the failure of the trial judge adequately to direct the jury in relation to the significance of substantial delay in complaint.” 
        
       
      
    7 The Crown's submissions set out the following:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""The matter came to trial 36 to 39 years after the alleged dates of the offences. The case depended solely upon the word of the appellant, there being no witnesses to the events and no admissions by the appellant. No direction of the type referred to in 
         Longman v. the Queen 
         (1979) 168CLR 79 at 91 was given in this case. This was a case that required a Longman warning.” 
        
       
      
    8 The Crown had referred to the necessary aspects of the Longman warning but concluded its submission conceding this ground on the first aspect of the Longman warning in saying:- 
     
      
       
        
        ""This fell short of the required direction that because of the delay, it would be dangerous to convict on the complainant's evidence alone unless the jury, scrutinising the evidence with great care was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of its truth and accuracy.” 
        
       
      
    9 The Crown concedes that no direction was given in this case as to the significance of delay in terms of its effect upon the appellant's ability to test the allegations made by the complainant and to obtain evidence to meet them. 
     
      
    10 It was in those circumstances that the Crown conceded that what comments were made by his Honour as to delay fell short of a warning sufficient to satisfy either aspect of the Longman direction or the requirements of those directions as confirmed by the High Court in Crampton v. The Queen (2000) 206 CLR 161 at 207-8, paragraphs 125 and 126. 
     
      
    11 The Crown conceded this was a matter to which the proviso to s.6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 could not go but did submit that a retrial should be ordered on all counts. There should be further reference of a short kind time to certain of the matters to which the Crown has already drawn attention. Although the case did depend upon the evidence of the complainant and the appellant and there were no independent witnesses to the events nor admissions, there was some evidence concerning some complaint said to have been made to a Mrs. Abernathy at the time of an offence which was charged as count five. 
     
      
    12 It appears that on any version of the events some altercation had occurred and the complainant had asserted an attempt to assault him in some way. 
     
      
    13 Due to the lapse of time such evidence of this complaint, as there might have been, to the police is now unavailable. There was some conflict as to the nature of the complaint and the detail of what it was said in that complaint might have occurred between the complainant and the appellant on other occasions arising as and between the evidence of the complainant and Mrs. Abernathy, the person to whom it was said the complaint was made. 
     
      
    14 On Mrs. Abernathy's version the complainant denied there having been any previous sexual offences committed upon him by the appellant. On the appellant's version he had complained concerning other sexual offences. It is the Crown's submission that in relation to all these offences there should be a retrial arising from the miscarriage occasioned by the lack of the appropriate direction. 
     
      
    15 Section 8 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provides for a power not originally granted to the United Kingdom criminal appellate courts to award a new trial. It provides:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) On an appeal against a conviction on indictment, the court may, either of its own motion, or on the application of the appellant, order a new trial in such manner as it thinks fit, if the court considers that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, and, that having regard to all the circumstances, such miscarriage of justice can be more adequately remedied by an order for a new trial than by any other order which the court is empowered to make.” 
        
       
      
    16 Section 6 which provides the legislative guide to what the court might do in determining appeals provides by subsection (2):- 
     
      
       
        
        “(2) Subject to the special provisions of this Act, the court shall, if it allows an appeal under s.5(1) against conviction, quash the conviction and direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered.” 
        
       
      
    17 The words “subject to the special provisions of this Act” refer inter alia to s.8. It is apparent then that in the event of the court finding a miscarriage has occurred it is necessary to ascertain whether such miscarriage can be more adequately remedied by an order for a new trial. In this respect, the common form criminal appeal provisions throughout Australia of which s.8 of the New South Wales Act is an example have been considered by the High Court of Australia in a number of decisions including in a decision on appeal to that Court from Nauru. 
     
      
    18 DPP (Nauru) v. Fowler (1984) 154 CLR 627 was a decision in which the High Court emphasised the necessity for a court considering whether to grant a new trial or not to have regard to ""all the circumstances"" as s.8 provides. 
     
      
    19 A correct approach has been held to be that each case has to be considered on all the facts and all the relevant considerations that apply to it, regard being had to the personal considerations of the appellant and to the overall justice of the case and in particular to the fair and impartial administration of justice: see King v. the Queen (1986) 161 CLR 423. 
     
      
    20 Where there is sufficient evidence that the matter might at trial be left to the jury the discretion is enlivened. Where as here the alleged events are so old and the opportunity of the appellant at a new trial to test the evidence as to them, is inevitably affected by the delay such that having proper regard to the impact of a direction to be given under Longman (supra) and Crampton (supra) it is not possible to say that the jury is highly likely to convict the Court is confronted with a difficult question. 
     
      
    21 This appellant has been in custody in respect of these matters for the bulk of the non-parole period imposed on the sentence imposed by the learned trial judge. There is no Crown appeal against sentence. There are a number of criticisms raised of the evidence of the complainant going, in my view, to matters of detail but matters that could be regarded as matters of seriousness as to the complainant's credibility on each count. 
     
      
    22 As far as the count on which the corroboration or early complaint to which I have referred is concerned, nonetheless the complaint was in such vague terms as not clearly to indicate just what had occurred such as to support the charge brought. 
     
      
    23 Putting it all together, and having regard to all relevant circumstances, I have not been persuaded by what the Crown has put that there should be a new trial on all of these counts or on any one of them. In my view, the appropriate course to take is that the appeal against the convictions following the trial before Moore, DCJ. should be allowed and the verdict of acquittal referred to in s.6 be entered. These are the orders I would propose. 
     
      
    24 SULLY J: I agree and I'll have something to say in a moment. Could I just raise, both for my brothers’ consideration and indeed for the assistance of counsel, it would be appropriate, would it not, to deal with both of the matters together since we've effectively heard them, in which event would we not do this: Grant leave to appeal out of time in both of the matters CCA60371 and CCA60372; in matter CCA60371 order that the appeal be allowed, that the convictions and sentences be quashed and on each count there be a directed judgment of acquittal, and that in matter CCA60372 grant leave to appeal against the sentence, appeal allowed to the extent of varying the commencing date of the sentences and non-parole periods from 3 December 2004 to 13 July 2000? Does that cover everything, Miss Burgess? 
     
      
       
      BURGESS: Yes, it does. 
       
       
      SULLY J: Madam Crown, is that adequate? Allow the appeal to the extent of varying the commencing date of the sentences and the non-parole periods from 3 December 2004 to 13 July 2000? 
       
       
      WILKINS: Yes, your Honour. I had understood my friend was going to technically abandon those appeals and your Honour would make an order under s.58 of the Crime Sentencing Procedure Act but I don't have a difficulty whichever way -- 
       
       
      GREG JAMES J: It's exactly the same effect. 
       
       
      BURGESS: I don't have a problem with that course. 
       
      
    25 GREG JAMES J: I agree with the orders proposed by the learned presiding judge for the reasons that I have given. 
     
      
    26 SULLY J: I agree that such orders should be made. I agree generally with the reasons given by Justice Greg James. Because of the circumstances of this case I wish myself to add three observations as follows: One, the decision of this court in these particular matters ought not to be regarded in any quarter as in any way detracting from the seriousness of the types of conduct charged against the appellant; two, the particular decision in these matters does not in any way weaken the proposition that a miscarriage of justice deriving from the failure to give a proper Longman direction will more often than not be sufficiently corrected by an order for a new trial; three, the directed acquittals in the present case are justified in my view by a concatenation of very unusual circumstances of which it is sufficient to say that they are adequately described, as I respectfully think, in what has fallen from Justice Greg James. Subject to those additional matters I concur in the making of the orders. 
     
      
    27 ADAMS J: I agree with the orders proposed and what has fallen from both Justice Greg James and Sully, J. 
     
      
    28 SULLY J: Those will be the orders, accordingly.

     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
       
      
    1 BRYSON JA: An account of the facts and of the trial of the appellant has been given by Hoeben J. By subs.6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 the Court of Criminal Appeal is empowered to set aside the verdict of the jury “…on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice …” This power is considerably wider than a power to decide whether there was evidence upon which reasonable people could find the verdict which was found; the power of the Court extends to setting aside the verdict on a basis referred to, briefly, as that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory. The expression “unsafe or unsatisfactory” appears to have been drawn from English legislation in different terms to subs.6(1), and does not accurately or completely refer to the test applied in Australia. The test is to be understood from M v. Regina (1994) 181 CLR 487, and approval expressed in Jones v. Regina (1997) 191 CLR 439 at 450 to 452 by the majority (Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ) of passages in M v. Regina, particularly in the judgment of Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ at 493-494. In my opinion it is authoritatively established by the majority judgment in Jones that the appropriate test for determining whether a verdict should be set aside is as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. 
        
       
      
    2 The test in Jones cannot be applied with complete precision, and sometimes leads to differences of judicial opinion on appeal; Jones itself is an example, as is M v. Regina. Notwithstanding observations of Brennan CJ in Jones at 441, it is my understanding that the test is not identical with the exposition given in Ratten v. Regina (1974) 131 CLR 510 at 516 by Barwick CJ which included the statement “If the Court has a doubt, a reasonable jury should be of a like mind.” The test in Jones significantly qualifies this statement and requires regard to be paid to the jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence.  
     
      
    3 In the present case, some circumstances and some aspects of the evidence make it seem disquieting to me that the jury convicted the appellant. The first and most prominent source of my disquiet is that the complainant did not make any complaint, and did not tell anyone at all that the offence had been committed, until there had been a delay of almost seven weeks, or perhaps almost eight weeks. It is not possible to ascertain the length of the delay because the complainant was unable to state the date of the offence: the complaint she made to the police left a wide margin, narrowed down by her evidence at the trial to four possible days. There were people readily to hand to whom she could complain, including Simon Scott her de facto partner, who returned to the house later on the evening of the offence, and Catherine Scott, Mr Scott’s mother, who was in the house at the time of the offence. No legal rule imposes a time limit on such a complaint and no legal rule disables a jury from coming to a conclusion about whether it is true. To my mind it is a considerable difficulty for believing her evidence that, although she said she was the victim of an outrageous sexual assault, she did not tell people who were readily to hand and were members of the same household as she; nor did she complain to the police; until a long interval had passed.  
     
      
    4 The complainant explained that she did not make a complaint to Simon Scott or to Catherine Scott because she was scared. She said in evidence: “I was scared too because of what he had done to me, scared that something was going to happen.” The complainant’s explanation never became more full or clear than saying that she was scared, and she said to this effect a number of times. She said that at the time of the offence she did not look around for help, and that she did not call out or yell, because she was scared and did not think of it. She explained that she did not ring the police, although there was a telephone in the house, as she was scared. The complainant did not see her doctor after the offence, and when challenged to explain why again said that she was too scared. The complainant did not give any clear evidence of what it was that she was frightened might happen, or of any threat, although her evidence was that the appellant said to her, after committing the offence “Don’t say [anything], I know people.”  
     
      
    5 To my mind ordinary human motivations and behaviour mean that a person who had suffered such an outrage would probably complain, and would do so at the first or at an early opportunity, and would be motivated to do so by a wish to have protection, as well as by a wish to seek redress. It would be plain to a reasonable person in the complainant’s position that prompt complaint to police would improve the prospects of effectual redress by enabling investigations to begin early; and would also improve the prospects of her being protected in an effectual way against the offender.  
     
      
    6 There are other circumstances which have given me disquiet. The circumstances of time and place as given by the complainant are improbable; the rear yard of an occupied house, near another house from which observation might conceivably be made, in circumstances where it would be plainly likely to an offender that the complainant might call out and get help. It was the complainant’s evidence that the appellant’s voice was louder than normal when he spoke to her. These circumstances seem to make it unlikely that an offence took place. 
     
      
    7 Another source of disquiet is that recurring and undue attention was given during the trial to the appellant’s having stayed away for some weeks from the house where the complainant lived with Mr Scott, although he had earlier attended there often. Witnesses spoke of the appellant’s changing an earlier pattern of attending at the house, but to different effects about when and for how long this happened. It is not possible to attribute significance to the suggestion that the appellant stayed away from the house. Times and lengths of this absence cannot be established. There are a number of different interpretations available on the evidence of the complainant and Mr Scott, while Mrs Scott put the period of absence at a different time, after the complainant had complained to the police. There were various references in the evidence to the complainant’s attitude when he did come around: “When he reappeared he was talking to Simon, he was not talking to me” and the appellant spoke of “bad vibes” from the complainant, in a context which, so far as it can be understood, suggests that the complainant might have resented the appellant taking Mr Scott away to go fishing. 8 This inconsequential subject received an unfortunate amount of recurring attention during the hearing. The appellant’s simply not visiting the house for some time, although he had visited there before, could not rationally have any probative force in support of guilt. However I do not see any sign that counsel for the Crown adopted any wrong course, or sought to make much of this essentially neutral circumstance, and the summing up contained no error on this subject; nor, so far as I can observe, on any subject; and no error was contended for. The last word the jury heard was the Trial Judge reminding them that defence counsel had pointed out that it was rather flimsy material to support the allegation. 
     
      
    9 The reasons for the disquiet I have expressed fall into two parts. First, I see grounds upon which reasonable people deciding the facts could very well lack confidence in the complainant’s evidence. Secondly, it seems procedurally unfair that the appellant was not given the advantages which a fresh complaint would have given him in explaining and establishing by evidence when and where he was at the time of the alleged offence. The delay in making the complaint must have produced some unfairness to the appellant, as on the assumption, which must be made for the purpose of testing fairness, that he was innocent, he was deprived of opportunities to recall the facts, and to prove the facts, possibly with the aid of evidence of persons other than himself, which he would have had if he had been told promptly of what was alleged against him, with details of time, place and circumstances. It is possible that he might have been able to explain in a clear way with circumstances that he was at some place where it was not possible for him to have committed the offence; he might have been able to call witnesses to establish that this was so, as well as to rely on his own evidence, or he might have been at a location not inconsistent with his having committed the offence, yet still have been innocent. After a delay of some weeks, and with a range of possible times of the offence, narrowed at the time of the trial to four different days, but in terms of the complainant’s first complaint to police considerably wider, the opportunity to give a full and clear account of his whereabouts was greatly diminished, and the possibility of inaccuracy in the account he gave was increased. I cannot see any more that the appellant could have done to present his case to the jury than actually was done. 
     
      
    10 The Trial Judge pointed out to the jury, carefully and fully, adverse implications against accepting the prosecution case which flowed from the delay in making the complaint. His Honour gave the jury a careful and clear warning of the danger of relying on the complainant’s evidence in the circumstances, and careful and to my mind complete instructions about the significance of delay in making a complaint. His Honour reminded the jury of the line of reasoning that delay was conduct inconsistent with the conduct of a truthful person when such an offence occurred, and also pointed out that delay in making a complaint did not necessarily indicate that the evidence of the complainant was false; that there might be good reasons to hesitate in making a complaint. His Honour referred the jury to the complainant’s evidence that she was scared. His Honour further pointed out, quite fully, the difficulties for the appellant arising from delay and the effects of delay on the appellant’s ability to defend himself, and on the opportunity of police to make investigations. His Honour told the jury  
     
      
       
        
        Now you think about that. You think and appreciate the difficulties which this delay and the vagueness and imprecision about the dates creates for the accused in this case. These are not possible problems, these are real problems.  
        
       
       
      There could have been no misunderstanding about the importance of this matter and about the need for the jury to consider it carefully. 
       
      
    11 The Trial Judge also directed the jury on the significance of their decision’s turning on word against word, and pointed out fully and clearly the need to be satisfied of the offence charged beyond reasonable doubt upon the complainant’s evidence, in terms which should have dispelled any idea that it was a simple matter of deciding which person’s evidence was preferred. His Honour gave the jury a careful warning about the danger of convicting on the evidence of the complainant alone, accompanied by an explanation of the jury’s entitlement to do so if they found it was right. 
     
      
    12 The task of finding the facts in a criminal prosecution, never I suppose easy, was acutely difficult in the present case; it was the duty of the jury to resolve these acute difficulties. None of the matters mentioned in the test approved in Jones as overcoming the jury’s advantages of seeing and hearing the evidence appears to me to apply. The grounds on which I think that the complainant’s evidence may lack credibility must have been sufficiently explained, to the thinking of the jurors who heard the evidence given and saw the manner in which it was given. To my mind the evidence displays some inadequacy, but it should not be said that it contained significant discrepancies or was tainted, or that for that or any other reason it lacked probative force in such a way as to lead me to the view that there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, when I make allowance for the advantages which the jury had. There is no objectively discernible reason why the complainant’s evidence lacked probative force.  
     
      
    13 It appears to me that the advantages which the jury had in finding the facts were enhanced by the circumstance that the appellant as well as the complainant gave evidence. Such a complete conflict of testimony could only be satisfactorily resolved by a jury. Unless the jury fully believed and accepted the claimant’s evidence they must have had a reasonable doubt, in view of the appellant’s evidence and sworn denial. From the verdict it must be understood that the jury disbelieved and rejected the appellant’s evidence of denial. This situation, recurring in litigation, of completely contradictory testimony about whether an event happened, from two sources both of whom must know what in truth happened, must in criminal cases be left to a jury to resolve, except where the test in Jones authorises intervention. Evidence which is not overwhelmingly strong, or is firmly contradicted, may yet base a verdict which the Court is not empowered to set aside. 
     
      
    14 With the benefit of the summing up by the Trial Judge the jury should not have misunderstood their task, what they were called on to decide if they were to accept the prosecution case and the possibility of error and injustice. The Trial Judge explained in a clear way how much the prosecution depended on accepting the complainant’s evidence, and his Honour’s directions should have dispelled any misconception that what was involved for the jury was the simple apposition of one witness’ evidence with another. The transcript of evidence which I have read has left me with the feeling that if the task had been mine I might very well have come to the conclusion that there was a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the appellant. The appellant gave evidence which distinctly denied the offence, he was challenged in cross-examination, and adhered to his position. The verdict of guilty seems to carry the implication that the jury did not regard his evidence as carrying any weight, for otherwise they could not, it seems to me, have reached any other conclusion than that there was a reasonable doubt about guilt.  
     
      
    15 The jury’s advantages over myself are very considerable. The jury, sitting in Bega and hearing evidence about events which occurred in Eden, and seeing and hearing the complainant and the appellant in Court giving their evidence, were far better able to place the complainant’s explanations and the facts generally in the context of the demeanour and the personal physique of the complainant and the appellant, and in a context of community life and social behaviour; very little of this is accessible to me, deciding the case on the papers. The jury were in a better position than I am to appraise and understand what significance should be given to realities of human interaction and the force of what, to me and at this distance, seem rather obscure references to the complainant’s being scared, her evidence that the appellant said “I know people” and the effect which deeply veiled threats and obscure statements might produce on the behaviour of the complainant. The jury also had the benefit of seeing and hearing the appellant giving evidence, and were able, in accordance with the directions given to them by the Trial Judge, to bring that advantage to bear on their deliberations and their verdict; and so too, with the rest of the evidence. They had a full opportunity to consider the bearing of circumstances of time and place, the significance of the absence of a prompt complaint and the explanation which the complainant gave for there not being a prompt complaint. It is plain to me that with those advantages all the disquiets I have expressed may have been completely dispelled. What appears to me to be a sworn denial with a fair claim to be considered as raising a reasonable doubt obviously appeared altogether differently to the jury; there must have had a reason, and I see no ground, within the test stated in Jones for overriding the jury’s decision. 16 After the consideration I have given I continue to see that it is possible that the appellant might have been convicted although innocent, but my perception does not survive the test that I must make full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury in coming to a conclusion. In my opinion the Court of Criminal Appeal should not set aside the verdict, but should dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    17 BARR J: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgment of Hoeben J. I agree with his Honour’s summary of the facts, save for the reference to the evidence of Mrs Scott. In her evidence-in-chief she said that the complainant and her husband had moved from Victoria to live in her house at the beginning of 2003 and that other relatives of hers used to visit the house. Her evidence continued -  
     
      
       
        
        Q Anyone in particular? 
        
       
       
        
        A Mark, Mark would come in and visit and go fishing and – with Simon. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Q I’m sorry I didn’t hear that. You say Mark came in did he? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yeah Mark would come and visit and go fishing and – with Simon and that.  
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q How regularly would Mark visit? 
        
       
       
        
        A He’d come up all the time mainly. You know.  
        
       
       
        
        Q Did Simon, your son and Mark get on well? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yes I think.  
        
       
       
        
        Q Now do you recall, was there any change in those visits by Mark Manton?  
        
       
       
        
        A There was a bit there after Simon and Diane told me what happened. He stopped coming around for a little while, but I was wondering why, but – yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q You recall that was when? 
        
       
       
        
        A After Simon said – I mean Diane said that she got raped.  
        
       
       
        
        Q Approximately how long was it that Mark was not coming around?  
        
       
       
        
        A About a few weeks there, but he’d come now and then you know in between, that’s about it.  
        
       
       
      
    18 In cross examination there was this evidence -  
     
      
       
        
        Q You said that he stopped coming around for a period, do you remember saying that? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q That period wasn’t very long was it? 
        
       
       
        
        A No it wasn’t. 
        
       
       
        
        Q How long would you estimate it was? 
        
       
       
        
        A Well about one or two weeks, not long.  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q Now, this period when you say he stopped coming, you said, in your evidence was “a few weeks”? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Do you remember making a statement to the police about this on 21 May last year? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yeah.  
        
       
       
        
        Q You said “ I remember” – this is paragraph 5, “that there was a period of time when Mark stopped coming around. This only lasted a week and a half or so and I didn’t think anything of it”. That’s what you said to the police? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yeah.  
        
       
       
        
        Q Was that correct? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yeah that was correct, but I didn’t know about the rape and that at the time too.  
        
       
       
        
        Q You didn’t – first of all you told the police it was only a week and a half or so? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yeah, Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Was that accurate? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yeah, around about that. I’m not quite you know, straight on.  
        
       
       
        
        Q It’s about a week and a half, that’s what you’re telling the police? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q Is that right? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q A the time, it didn’t seem unusual or strange? 
        
       
       
        
        A Well not really. You know he’d come and go. Mark used to live with me a long time ago.  
        
       
       
        
        Q You’re his aunt? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yeah or first cousin.  
        
       
       
        
        Q You told the police you didn’t think anything of this, that is you didn’t think anything of him not coming around for about a week and a half? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yeah.  
        
       
      
    19 I do not think that Mrs Scott would have wondered why the appellant stopped coming to the house after the complainant broke her silence. If the complainant was telling the truth, it would have been obvious to Mrs Scott why the appellant had stopped visiting. Her answers in cross-examination show, I think, that she was saying that the appellant stayed away during a period of time before the complainant told Mrs Scott that he had raped her. That construction better explains her answers in chief - 
     
      
       
        
        But I was wondering why. 
        
       
       
      And in cross examination -  
       
       
        
        But I didn’t know about the rape at the time.  
        
       
      
    20 The appellant did not disagree with a suggestion in cross-examination that he did not go to the house for a period anywhere between a few weeks and a couple of months. He explained it, however, because he said that he fished with his Uncle Warren at those times rather than with the complainant’s husband. There was also this question and answer - 
     
      
       
        
        Q There was a period of anywhere up to a couple of months where you didn’t go fishing with Simon? 
        
       
       
        
        A Sort of on and off.  
        
       
      
    21 The complainant’s evidence about the rape was basic, but sufficient, if believed, to justify a finding of guilt. The evidence of the complainant was supported by her own evidence as well as that of her husband and Mrs Scott and, to the extent that I have summarised, the appellant, that the appellant stayed away from the house for a significant time. Circumstances that might have tended to raise a reasonable doubt about the reliability of the complainant’s account were that she said that the rape took place at a place and a time when the incident might have been seen by strangers. The complainant was unable to fix the time of the event. She did not complain straight away but waited several weeks before telling anybody.  
     
      
    22 The impression the complainant made on the jury was critical. This appeal illustrates the difficulty which an intermediate appellate court has in assessing evidence without the opportunity to see and hear the witness.  
     
      
    23 The evidence shows that the complainant was of aboriginal descent. She and her husband had lived in Victoria for some indeterminate period and in Eden, New South Wales, some few weeks before the event complained of. A reading of her evidence suggests that she was usually able to understand the meaning of the question she was asked. She failed to answer some questions, but that may have been because she was distressed by the process of examination. It is not possible, however, to say that that accounts for every failure of hers to answer questions.  
     
      
    24 The complainant told the jury that she did not tell anyone about the matter because she was scared. That was a statement the jury had to consider in deciding whether to accept her evidence. The reason why she was scared, she said, was that the appellant told her that he “knew people”. Whether that explanation for her silence was plausible depended very much on an assessment of the personality of the complainant. An experienced, worldly woman might have difficulty convincing a jury that she could be silenced by such a vague statement. What, then, was the complainant like? Was she strong-minded, timid, diffident? The jury knew, but this Court can gain very little idea. Her background does not suggest any degree of sophistication. She may have been cowed by the vague threat.  
     
      
    25 The same remarks may be made about the complainant‘s failure to identify the precise evening on which the attack took place. Failure of memory about such matters is not unusual in cases of this kind. The complainant was obviously not very good at remembering dates. The fact that she could not remember a date, however, did not point more to the falsity of her story than to its truth. If she had made up the story, she had made a poor fist of her lie. If she was telling the truth, she had made a poor fist of describing something that really happened.  
     
      
    26 The event central to the Crown case was not something the complainant could have been mistaken about. Either it happened or she was lying. The jury were required to assess her honesty. In my opinion the demeanour of the complainant as she gave evidence must have given the jury a much more reliable indication of her honesty than can be obtained by a reading of the cold word on the page. The weaknesses in her evidence were capable of explanation and the jury accepted the explanation. There was some support independently of the complainant’s evidence of the truth of what she said. I have assessed the evidence, as I must, and I have acknowledged the superior position in which the jury were, as I must. It has not been made to appear to me that the verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.  
     
      
    27 I would dismiss the appeal.  
     
      
    28 HOEBEN J:  
     
      
      Offence and sentence 
       
      Mark Anthony Manton, the appellant, came for trial before Judge Knight and a jury at Bega between 23 and 26 February 2004. The indictment charged that the appellant, between 28 February 2003 and 31 March 2003 at Eden had sexual intercourse with Diane Carol Howden without her consent and knowing she was not consenting, in breach of s61I of the  
      Crimes Act NSW 
       1900. On 26 February the jury returned a verdict of guilty. 
       
      
    29 On 5 April 2004 Judge Knight sentenced the appellant to a period of imprisonment of 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months, such non-parole period to commence on 26 February 2004 and expire on 25 August 2007. The parole period was to commence on 26 August 2007 and expire on 25 February 2009. 
     
      
    30 The appellant has appealed against his conviction on the basis that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. It is not contended that his Honour Judge Knight erred in his conduct of the trial, or in his directions to the jury. 
     
      
       
      The evidence 
       
      
    31 Diane Carol Howden, the complainant, gave evidence that she had moved to Eden with her de facto husband, Simon Scott, and four children two months before the incident, ie late January 2003. The family lived with Simon’s mother, Catherine Scott, at Rodd Street, Eden. A regular visitor to Rodd Street was the appellant, who was Simon’s cousin. He and Simon would often go fishing. 
     
      
    32 The complainant said that on a Thursday or Friday evening between 9 and 10 pm she went into the backyard to retrieve some washing from a line. The four children and Mrs Scott were in bed. Simon had gone out, taking his car. In the yard she heard someone say “Oi”. It was the appellant. He asked for sex. The complainant refused. The appellant’s eyes were red and glassy and his voice was louder than normal. He grabbed the complainant and pushed her to the ground. He said that “He knows people”. The complainant was scared and thought she might be hurt. 
     
      
    33 The complainant said that he removed her tracksuit trousers and knickers and put his penis in her vagina. The act of intercourse took five to ten minutes. When he stopped he said “Don’t say nothing, I know people”. This made the complainant feel scared. She ran inside, locked the door and had a shower. She then went to her room and cried. She did not say anything to Catherine Scott that night. She did not say anything to Simon Scott that night. She did not do so because she was scared. “I was scared too because of what he’d done to me, scared that something was going to happen.” (T.25.1) 
     
      
    34 The complainant did not tell anyone about the incident until a day or so before she made her statement to the police on 9 May 2003. The first person she told was Simon Scott. The complainant estimated that the incident had occurred on 13 or 14 or on 20 or 21 March 2003. She was able to say this because she knew the incident occurred on either a Thursday or a Friday night and because “it happened more at the end of the month and the last week of the month I got my period”. (T.26.12) The complainant had had two periods between the date of the incident and when she made her statement to the police. Her menstrual cycle was regular and normally occurred in the last week of every month. 
     
      
    35 The complainant could not remember anything about the clothing which the appellant was wearing. She did not scream out because she was scared. She was scared that she was going to be hurt. She said that after this incident she did not see the appellant for a couple of months because he stayed away. After a couple of months he came back and started going to the house again. The complainant broke down and wept on at least two occasions while giving her evidence in chief. 
     
      
    36 The complainant was cross-examined. She agreed that she had told the police in her statement on 9 May 2003 that the incident happened in March or April. The complainant agreed that in that same statement she had told the police that she did not know the date when the incident happened “but it was before the Easter school holidays and a couple of months after we moved to Cathy’s place”. It was common ground that the Easter school holidays commenced on 18 April 2003. She now realised the incident could not have taken place in April. She said that when she made the police statement, she could not think properly. She was too stressed to give an accurate date.  
     
      
    37 The complainant gave evidence at committal proceedings on 17 October 2003. In those proceedings this exchange occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You said in your statement as well that it happened before Easter. Did you have any idea roughly how long it was before Easter or? 
         
        A. I knew it wasn’t too far. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Would you say a week or two weeks before Easter? 
         
        A. I’m not sure”. 
        
       
       
      The complainant said that she gave that answer because she could not think properly. She agreed that the incident could not have occurred a week or two before Easter (T.35). 
       
      
    38 The complainant thought she had last seen the appellant either on the day of the incident, or the day before. The appellant had quit his job before the incident (T.37.33). The complainant was adamant that the appellant stayed away for a period longer than a week, and it seemed like two months. In her statement to the police the complainant had referred to the appellant staying away for “a month or more”. Thereafter the appellant resumed visiting the house, but not as regularly as before, going for drives with Simon and going into the bush with him looking for plants (T.38.40). 
     
      
    39 Despite sharing a room, she did not tell Simon of the incident that night. She did not tell his mother Cathy of the incident, either that night or the next day. She did not cry in front of either one of them the next day. She did not appear upset in front of them the next day. She could not think of any behaviour on her part in the weeks following the incident which might have indicated that she had been sexually assaulted. She told no one during that time. 
     
      
    40 She did not see a doctor because she did not feel as though she had been injured. She was too scared to go to the doctor. This was despite the fact that she was planning to have another child. She did not tell the police until 9 May. She was too scared. She kept the clothes she was wearing, but had washed them. She did not think to keep the clothes unwashed so that they could be tested by the police.  
     
      
    41 The backyard where the attack took place was well lit. It was overlooked by two buildings one of which gave a good view into the backyard. The neighbours were close enough to have heard the complainant if she had screamed. She did not do so. She did not look around to see if there was anyone about. She was too scared to think. She did not yell out for help because she was too scared. There was a phone in the house that night, but she did not use it. The complainant said that she did not know when she thought she might get hurt, but was scared that the appellant was going to hurt her if she rang the police or told anyone. The complainant broke down and wept on at least one occasion during cross-examination. 
     
      
    42 Simon Scott gave evidence that there was a period when the appellant had stopped coming around, that he thought he had offended him in some way and that the complainant was different with the appellant after the incident, but he did not know the dates. 
     
      
    43 Mrs Scott gave evidence that the appellant had stopped coming around for one or two weeks after the complainant had told Mrs Scott what had happened. Mrs Scott had not noticed anything unusual or strange about the appellant or the complainant.  
     
      
    44 The appellant gave evidence and was cross-examined. He denied that he had sexually assaulted the complainant. He was a little vague about whether he had reduced the number of visits to Rodd Street. He agreed that for a period he had not gone fishing with Mr Scott as often as before. It was his custom to visit Rodd Street on weekends and sometimes during the week. He thought the complainant did not like him taking Simon away to go fishing. He had not found out about the allegation by the complainant until an occasion when he borrowed some videos from Mrs Scott and he mentioned it to Simon the next day when he returned the videos. 
     
      
    45 Warren Russell, Mr Scott’s uncle, gave evidence. He and the appellant had both worked on an oyster farm until 30 March 2003. The appellant would work during the week and get a lift into Eden and stay with him on weekends. 
     
      
     
     
      
      Deficiencies in Crown case 
       
      
    46 The complainant’s evidence was entirely uncorroborated. The Crown case was totally dependent upon her evidence. There was no scientific or medical support for the claimed sexual assault. There was no complaint at the time or for a considerable period thereafter (six or seven weeks on the complainant’s testimony). 
     
      
    47 The appellant’s suggested cessation of visits to Rodd Street did not corroborate the complainant. There was a factual issue as to whether such a cessation of visits had taken place and if so, for what period of time. The complainant was unclear as to length of time, varying between one month, two months, and more than a week which felt like two months. Mr Scott said a month and a half – two months. Mrs Scott said there was a period of one or two weeks after the complainant had reported the incident. The appellant said there was a period when he stopped fishing with Mr Scott but still visited every weekend. 
     
      
    48 There was a legal issue as to how that evidence was to be used. In address the Crown sought to use the evidence of the complainant and Mr Scott on that issue to challenge the credit of the appellant. In cross-examination, however, it had been put to the appellant that the reason he stopped coming around was because he had raped the complainant, ie consciousness of guilt (T84.54). No direction in accordance with Edwards v R (1993) 178 CLR 193 at 211 was sought or given on that issue. 
     
      
    49 It is difficult to see what use could or should have been made of that evidence by a reasonable jury. The evidence itself was contradicted and contradictory. It was not corroborative and was open to a number of innocent explanations. There was a real risk that the emphasis given to that evidence by the Crown may have misled the jury. It is difficult to see how that evidence supported the Crown case.  
     
      
    50 The complainant’s cross-examination demonstrated inconsistencies in her identification of when the assault had taken place. In the police statement of 9 May 2003 and in the committal proceedings on 17 October 2003, she had referred to the incident taking place shortly before Easter (the Easter school holidays commenced 18 April). Her evidence at trial identified four possible dates in March. She agreed that the incident could not and did not occur in April. Her explanation was that she was too stressed and could not think properly on those occasions when she referred to April. It was clear from her evidence that the dates nominated at trial were a reconstruction by her based on the occurrence of her periods since the incident and that she had no actual recollection of the date.  
     
      
    51 The delay in complaint raised considerations of inherent improbability. Once the door of the house was locked against any intruder, there was ample opportunity to either complain to Mrs Scott, to Mr Scott when he returned home, or to telephone the police. That opportunity continued for the whole period of the delay until a day or two before 9 May 2003. The explanation of being scared was, in the circumstances, unsatisfactory. No actual violence had been used during the assault, nor any specific violence threatened. The expression “I know people” was vague and non-specific. 
     
      
    52 The delay in complaint created major problems for the appellant in defending himself. If innocent, his ability to recall events which took place at the time of the incident was impeded, particularly when the date was so non-specific. It had the effect of relegating the appellant from giving an account of what actually happened to “what must have happened”. 
     
      
    53 The appellant’s opportunity to obtain evidence refuting the circumstances of the offence was significantly reduced. The appellant’s and the complainant’s movements on the day of the alleged incident were material facts. Proof of them would have gone far to support one or other of the opposing cases. The situation for the appellant as to whether the incident took place on a Thursday or a Friday may have been significant given the evidence that he worked at the oyster farm during the week and went to Eden on the weekends. 
     
      
    54 If complaint had been made promptly and the appellant was innocent as he claimed to be, he may have been able to obtain DNA or other scientific evidence which exculpated him. This was not only rendered impossible by the delay but also because the complainant had washed the clothes she was wearing at the time of the incident and she was unable to remember and therefore identify the clothes which the appellant was allegedly wearing at the time. 
     
      
    55 Apart from those matters, there were other problems in the Crown case. The complainant did not look to the neighbouring houses for assistance despite one of them overlooking the backyard which was well lit. She did not yell out, despite there being no actual threat of immediate harm. Although intending to have another child, she did not consult a doctor. In the circumstances of the assault as described, one would have expected the complainant to have had a justified fear of infection. Finally, there was nothing in her behaviour or demeanour, immediately following the incident and in the weeks thereafter, to indicate that it had occurred. 
     
      
    56 The appellant was not shaken in cross-examination. He made appropriate concessions. Given the vagueness of the time frame of the allegation against him, calling Mr Warren to establish that he worked at the oyster farm at Pambula during the week and spent his weekends fishing, was the best that could be done to mount a defence. The appellant’s sworn evidence denying the allegation must be properly taken into account. 
     
      
       
      Power of this Court 
       
      
    57 Under s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 this Court is required to set aside a conviction if it is: 
     
      
       
        
        “Of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the Court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice.” 
        
       
      
    58 In M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 492, the majority said that although the phrase “unsafe or unsatisfactory” did not appear in s6, it allowed a verdict to be set aside when the verdict was unreasonable or not supportable on the evidence. In the same case, McHugh J said (p 523) that a “miscarriage of justice” arose whenever the accused had not had a fair trial according to law or whenever the nature of the evidence, the directions to the jury or the procedures that were followed raised a real doubt as to whether the conviction could be regarded as a safe or just conviction. Having regard to the statements in M, there can be no doubt that “a miscarriage of justice” also occurs when the finding or verdict of the jury raises a real doubt as to whether a conviction is safe or just.  
     
      
    59 In M, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ said (p 493) that the test for an unsafe or unsatisfactory verdict was whether the court thought that, upon the whole of the evidence, it was “open” to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. This decision was reached, however, not merely by examining the transcript of evidence and the exhibits. 
     
      
       
        
        “In answering the question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations.” (p 493) 
        
       
      
    60 The majority explained the application of the test as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a Court of Criminal Appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the Court of Criminal Appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence.” (p 494)

      Conclusion 
       
      
    61 This was not a case which depended upon which of two witnesses the jury preferred. Even if the jury preferred the evidence of the complainant it still had to be satisfied as to the commission of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt. There was nothing inherently improbable in the account given by the appellant which could have led a jury to reject his version of events. There were, on the other hand, a number of inherent improbabilities in the complainant’s evidence relating to her failure to complain, her post accident conduct and her inability to particularise when the incident occurred. I am of the opinion that the implausibility of the complainant’s evidence was such that it could not be overcome by the advantage which the jury had of seeing and hearing the witnesses. 
     
      
    62 In my opinion, the proper application of the test formulated by the majority of the High Court in M and which was specifically approved in Jones v The Queen requires that the conviction of the appellant be set aside on the basis that it was unsafe and unsatisfactory. 
     
      
    63 The orders which I propose are: 
     
      
       
      (i) Appeal allowed. 
       
       
      (ii) The conviction is quashed and in lieu thereof, a verdict of acquittal is to be entered.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: I agree with Hidden J. 
     
      
    2 HIDDEN J: The appellant, Ming Jin, appeals against his conviction of two counts of dishonestly obtaining money by deception after a trial in the District Court. He was sentenced to terms of imprisonment aggregating three years, with a non-parole period of one year and nine months, to date from 3 October 2004. He notified an application for leave to appeal against sentence, but he abandoned it at the hearing. No doubt, this is because he is due for release on parole very soon, on 2 July 2006.  
     
      
    3 He was legally represented at the trial but he has prepared and argued his appeal without representation. His notice of appeal was lodged almost a year out of time, but the Crown raised no objection on that account. 
     
      
       
      The evidence 
       
      
    4 The course of the trial is conveniently summarised in the Crown prosecutor’s written submissions, as follows: 
     
      
       
      The Crown case 
       
       
        
        Ms Yi Yin Choi was a married woman who was living in Australia with her two children. Her husband Mr Wong was a wealthy man who supported her but who was living in Hong Kong. Whilst Ms Choi was studying English at the Migrant Centre in Surry Hills she met the appellant and formed a relationship with him. The appellant told Ms Choi that he was a businessman from New York on an American passport. He said that he was in the medicine business and that he was investing $250,0000 in Australia. 
        
       
       
        
        The appellant told Ms Choi that he needed to borrow $150,000 from her for ingredients to produce medicine. He said he would repay her by 15 July 1999. Ms Choi said that she only had $80,000 and on 22 June 1999 she gave him $80,000 in cash. She did not obtain anything in writing from him about the loan because she trusted that he was able to pay the money back by 15 July 1999. The money was never repaid (count 1). 
        
       
       
        
        The appellant learnt that Ms Choi had $390,000 in a term deposit which was due to mature on 16 July 1999. On 15 July 1999 the appellant asked Ms Choi if he could borrow money so he could complete a contract with a medical manufacturing company in North Sydney. He said if he did not pay the money he would lose his $1.31 million deposit. The appellant promised her that if she gave him the $390,000, which he needed in cash, that he would give her two cheques, for the $80,000 and the $390,000, on the following Monday the 19th July 1999 when he returned from a short trip to China. 
        
       
       
        
        On 16 July 1999 Ms Choi withdrew the $390,000 and gave it to the appellant who told her that he was taking the money to the North Sydney manufacturer. Later that day Ms Choi saw the appellant at the Star City Casino when he confirmed that he had sent the money to the manufacturer and that he would repay her on the Monday. The appellant rang Ms Choi from overseas to say that he had been arrested at Beijing airport and his assets had been frozen. Ms Choi never heard from him again and never saw him again (count 2). 
        
       
       
        
        Ms Choi realised she had been cheated by the appellant, so she called her husband who advised her to report the matter to the police. Ms Choi contacted “Bobby” who was an English speaking friend of her husband’s. On 19 July 1999 Bobby spoke on Ms Choi’s behalf to a security guard at the Peak apartments. The security Guard took an “Incident Report” and handed it to police that day. 
        
       
       
        
        The appellant had in fact left Sydney on 17 July 1999 on a ticket to Shanghai (not Beijing). He returned from China on 15 June 2003. He was arrested at the Casino on 17 June 2003 after he was seen there by Ms Choi’s friend. 
        
       
       
      The appellant’s case 
       
       
        
        The appellant did not give or call evidence in the trial. Rather the appellant’s case was advanced through cross-examination of the Crown witnesses. In that regard, it was put to Ms Choi that the payments of $80,000 and $390,000, together with a further amount of $10,000, were paid to the appellant as the purchase price of a painting by Tang Yi, which the appellant sold to her. Ms Choi, Ms (Amy) Qin, and Ms (Sasha) Mei each gave evidence of an occasion on which the appellant had shown them two paintings which he said were valuable and which he was carrying in a briefcase. 
        
       
       
        
        Ms Choi was cross-examined about: her statements to police; her admission to them that the appellant had shown her a painting about Tom Pat Fu; and the fact that the appellant had told her that the painting he had could be sold at a profit. 
        
       
       
        
        It was put to the jury on the appellant’s behalf that: they would have serious doubts about the evidence of Ms Choi; there was simply nothing in writing to confirm the alleged loans to the appellant; the unlikelihood that Ms Choi would give someone she had only known a few months such large amounts of cash unless it was for some other purpose such as to obtain the painting; the evidence of other witnesses supported the appellant’s possession of paintings; Ms Choi expected to marry the appellant, and the jury would accept that she could have the money and the painting; the only person who was deceived was Ms Choi’s husband; the inconsistent statement made to the security officer that the appellant had told her he had family problems linked to money, and not that he needed money for pharmaceuticals. 
        
       
       
        
       
      The Appeal 
       
      
    5 The appellant filed five grounds of appeal. He also filed a written submission which deals with some of those grounds, and adds a significant amount of new material. He presented lengthy oral argument at the hearing. The Crown prosecutor furnished helpful and detailed written submissions in response to the appellant’s written material, and was content to rely upon those submissions at the hearing. In the event, I do not believe that I would do disservice to the arguments of either of them by dealing with the matter relatively briefly. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 
       
      
    6 The effect of the first ground of appeal is a complaint that the trial judge directed the jury that their verdicts must be unanimous, and did not explain that they could be discharged if they were unable to agree. The short answer to that ground is that no occasion for such an explanation arose at the trial. The jury might have been told of the possibility of discharge if they had conveyed to the judge that they were having difficulty agreeing upon verdicts and his Honour had given them a direction in accordance with Black v The Queen (1993) 179 CLR 44. However, they did not convey any such difficulty. Indeed, they returned with verdicts after a retirement of only one hour and twenty-two minutes. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 
       
      
    7 The second ground relates to a document which was in evidence as exhibit C. The document was written by the appellant and expressed his intention to marry Ms Choi. He signed it. She also signed it, firstly in a different name and then in her own name. She gave evidence of why she did so, the effect of which, as I understand it, is that she did not take the document seriously. She said that the document came into being before she provided any money to the appellant. 
     
      
    8 The ground of appeal complains that the jury sent a question to the trial judge, asking what was implied by the “fraudulent signatures on the promise to marry”, to which the judge responded that it did not matter. However, the transcript records no such exchange. It does record that during the summing-up the jury sent a note to his Honour requesting “a translation” of the document “in relation to the two signatures”. This led his Honour to remind them of Ms Choi’s evidence about the document. That, of course, was entirely appropriate.  
     
      
       
      Ground 3 
       
      
    9 The summary of the evidence set out above refers to the “incident report” prepared by the security guard to whom Ms Choi spoke on 19 July 1999. That document also was in evidence, as exhibit A. On the face of it, two matters contained in it were inconsistent with Ms Choi’s evidence at the trial, and she was cross-examined about that. As to one of them, she denied having said what was recorded in the document. She had spoken to the security officer through an (unqualified) interpreter. 
     
      
    10 The third ground claims that, in relation to “a huge discrepancy” between the incident report and Ms Choi’s evidence, the judge had said that “it might be a mistake made by the interpreter…”. It is not necessary to recite the detail of the inconsistencies about which Ms Choi was cross-examined. It is sufficient to say that they could not readily be described as “a huge discrepancy”. More importantly, the appellant does not identify any part of the transcript in which his Honour said the words attributed to him about a mistake made by the interpreter. When dealing generally with the incident report in the summing-up, he invited the jury to bear in mind that it had been obtained through an interpreter. There the matter appears to have rested and, again, this was entirely appropriate.  
     
      
       
      Ground 4 
       
      
    11 The fourth ground relates to the appellant’s understanding of the trial proceedings. It complains that the interpreter at the trial spoke Cantonese while he spoke Mandarin, and that the judge refused a request by his counsel to change the interpreter. Again, the transcript does not record any such exchange between counsel and the trial judge. Morevover, it is contradicted by the affidavit of the appellant’s solicitor at the trial, who is also Chinese and, I take it, fluent in Mandarin. It appears that, in fact, there were two interpreters during the course of the trial and the solicitor had no difficulty understanding either of them.  
     
      
       
      Ground 5 
       
      
    12 The fifth ground alleges a lack of capacity and competence on the part of counsel who appeared for the appellant at the trial. It is sufficient to say that that complaint is answered effectively by an affidavit of counsel, and there is nothing in the record of the trial to suggest other than that the appellant’s case was conducted diligently and ably. 
     
      
       
      Other matters 
       
      
    13 In his written submission, the appellant also made an allegation against his solicitor about a matter unconnected with the conduct of the trial. He produced no evidence to support the allegation, and it is denied in the solicitor’s affidavit. As it does not bear upon the conduct of the trial, it is of no present relevance.  
     
      
    14 The appellant also complains in the written submission that his solicitor and counsel did not allow him “to speak and defend himself during the hearing”. This, no doubt, is a reference to the fact that he did not give evidence. However, the transcript records a statement by counsel after an adjournment that the appellant had provided instructions that he did not wish to give evidence. Moreover, annexed to the affidavits of both the solicitor and the barrister are copies of written instructions to that effect signed by the appellant and attested to by an interpreter.  
     
      
    15 The written submission complains of other things alleged to have been said by his Honour during the summing-up. Yet again, the statements complained of do not appear in the transcript. It is also said that two questions asked by the jury were not answered, but from the transcript it appears that any question that was asked was answered. Finally, complaint is directed to an observation which his Honour made in the course of referring to evidence relating to the painting. His Honour did make the observation but it was within his province to do so and, in any event, he made it clear that it was a matter for the jury to assess. 
     
      
    16 Otherwise, the written submission and the appellant’s oral argument amounted to a criticism of the evidence in the trial, and the assertion that certain material not produced at the trial was inconsistent with Ms Choi’s evidence or supported his account of relevant events. Argument was directed, in particular, to the evidence about the painting, about his departure from Sydney in July 1999 and the phone call said to be from Beijing, and about his relationship with Ms Choi. He sought to impugn her credibility generally. 
     
      
    17 In so far as he relied upon material not led at the trial, or issues not raised at the trial, he has provided no basis for this Court to receive and consider that material as fresh evidence. Some of them are matters about which he might have given evidence if he had chosen to do so, although it must be said that in large part they were of peripheral relevance only. Otherwise, his criticisms of the evidence were the subject of cross-examination and were dealt with by counsel in their addresses, and were for the jury to assess. It is sufficient to say that nothing he raised could provide any justification for the verdict being set aside. 
     
      
    18 I would dismiss the appeal.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Allan Martin Simpson appears for sentence today after having been found guilty by a jury on one count of robbery in company. The crown case against him was not that he actually performed the robbery but that he was part of a joint criminal enterprise with those who did. The whole of the offender’s involvement was captured on a number of closed circuit television cameras which were installed at the 7-Eleven store where the robbery took place. The trial of the offender was unusual in the sense that there was no dispute as to the fact that a robbery took place while the accused was in the 7-Eleven store. What was in dispute was whether the offender agreed with those who performed the robbery that the offence would be carried out. 2 The footage from the closed circuit television camera was played in court and I have reviewed the footage in chambers for the purpose of preparing these remarks on sentence. That footage shows three men, one of whom is the offender, coming into the 7-Eleven store. The three men move about the store with one purchasing cigarettes by means of an EFTPOS facility. The offender is seen to surreptitiously enter a back room of the premises and to look around whilst there. It is clear he was searching for something to steal. He then returns to the public area of the store. Shortly thereafter, one of the three men, Mr Hampton, goes behind the counter where the victim of the robbery, Mr Zhang, was standing. He presents a knife to Mr Zhang and demands money. Mr Zhang hands over $1,500 to Mr Hampton, who then passes it to another of the three men, Mr Palmer. Eventually, the two of them leave the store. 3 The footage also reveals the offender leaving the store at about the same time that Mr Palmer commences to go behind the counter. It was the offender’s defence at trial that as soon as he realised what was going on, namely that Mr Hampton was robbing Mr Zhang, he left the store wanting no part of what occurred. His version of events as given to police in an electronically recorded interview, was that he had no knowledge that the robbery was going to be committed and as soon as he realised what was going on he left quickly. The jury clearly did not accept this as a reasonably possible version of events. By their verdict, they must have concluded that the accused entered into an agreement with Mr Hampton and Mr Palmer that a robbery would be committed. The crown case was that the offender’s part in the robbery was to assist by looking around to see if the robbery could take place, an activity summed up by the expression, “casing the joint”.4 The fact that the offender left the store immediately upon Mr Hampton commencing to rob Mr Zhang, raises the issue of the factual basis on which I am to sentence the offender. Why did he leave the store?5 I am satisfied that I should sentence the offender consistent with the jury’s verdict on the basis that whilst he agreed with Mr Palmer and Mr Hampton that a robbery would be committed, and whilst it was agreed that that robbery would be in company, and whilst he initially played his role as a person who was casing the joint, he changed his mind as soon as the actual robbery commenced. It may well be that what prompted the offender to change his mind was the presentation of a knife by Mr Hampton, or it may be that the offender simply thought better of it.6 Whatever the answer to that question, the fact of withdrawal is a very important aspect in assessing the appropriate sentence. It is also very important when comparing the sentence which was imposed by his Honour, then Acting Judge McGuire, on Mr Palmer. He received a sentence consisting of a non-parole period of three years with a balance of term of eighteen months.7 However, when comparing the sentence imposed on Mr Palmer to that which I will impose on upon the offender, it is important to bear in mind a number of factors, the most important of which is that Mr Palmer was sentenced on the basis that he knew that Mr Hampton was armed with a knife and that he knew that that knife was going to be used in the course of the robbery. Further, of course, Mr Palmer never changed his mind, unlike this offender. The offender is to be sentenced on the basis that he was not aware that a knife was to be used and that he withdrew from the enterprise as soon as the robbery itself commenced.8 Also in relation to Mr Palmer’s sentence, I have to bear in mind that he pleaded guilty and was on protection at the time he was sentenced. I have to ensure that as far as I can, the offender is not left with a justifiable sense of grievance when he compares the sentence imposed upon him with a sentence imposed upon Mr Palmer. 9 The offender has a lengthy criminal history. Indeed, he was released from custody only a very short period of time before he committed this offence. I will not sentence him on the basis that he was on parole at the time of this offence, the crown being unable to demonstrate to me that that was the case. 10 The offender is now thirty-three years of age. He has four children but is separated from his de-facto partner who is the mother of his children. He had a troubled childhood and has had difficulties with drugs for a long period of time. The offender hopes to reform his relationship with the mother of his children upon his release from custody. It cannot be said that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation, but he is frankly coming to the age where he might think better of spending large portions of the rest his life in custody. 11 To a psychologist he said that he was disappointed for becoming involved in the present matter. In view of the fact that he pleaded not guilty to the charge that requires some explanation. The offender did plead guilty to an alternative charge laid by the crown of being an accessory after the fact to the robbery. The evidence showed that after the robbery was complete, he met up with the others and assisted them in secreting the proceeds of the robbery. The offender admitted that he had been guilty of that offence but denied that he was guilty of the offence of robbery in company, although the jury did not agree. Nevertheless, that explained why it was that the offender admitted that he had been involved in wrongdoing and was disappointed with himself. 12 This is a case where the victim of the offence was vulnerable. I am not going to take into account as an aggravating circumstance that there was planning in this matter because it was, after all, a robbery in company matter and virtually all, if not all, robberies in company involve at least a limited degree of planning. But nor can I say that there was an absence of planning which amounts to a mitigating factor. The evidence is simply neutral as to whether there was planning or not.13 The offender also, I am satisfied, expressed his anger at the actions of his co-offenders when he was interviewed by police. I am satisfied that that expression of anger was genuine. That tends to demonstrate that whilst the offender was willing to involve himself in some criminal activity, he was certainly not intending to involve himself in the actual actions of the other two men. 14 Although the offender did not plead guilty to the offence for which he is now to be sentenced he did, as I have said, plead guilty to the alternative count which limited the issues which were before the jury at the trial.15 The R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 guideline is of some limited assistance, although the most important factor, to be borne in mind when looking at Henry, is that that was a guideline judgment for offences of armed robbery. This was an offence of robbery in company and although there was a weapon used, as I have said repeatedly, the offender had no part of that. He is to be sentenced on the basis that he was not aware that Mr Zhang would be robbed by an offender who was armed with a knife.16 In those circumstances I am satisfied that whilst a period of imprisonment is required, it does not need to be as long as that imposed upon Mr Palmer by Acting Judge McGuire. I am also satisfied that there are special circumstances in this case. They primarily relate to the need for the offender to be assisted in dealing with his problems with drugs, upon his release from custody.17 The order I make is this, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment, it is agreed that that sentence should commence on 12 April 2006. I set a non-parole period of eighteen months which is to expire on 11 October 2007 and I set a head sentence of three years. The offender is therefore to be released from custody on 11 October 2007. It is a condition of his release to parole that he accept the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
      THE COURT: 
       
       
      Introduction 
       
      
    1 On 22 September 2006 the appellant was convicted, following a trial before Murrell SC DCJ and jury, of importing goods into Australia to which s 233B of the Customs Act 1901 applied, to wit, prohibited imports consisting of a quantity of cocaine being not less than the commercial quantity applicable to cocaine. 
     
      
    2 The appellant has appealed against conviction. The notice of appeal was filed a few days out of time. The Crown took no objection to an extension of time being granted by the Court for the filing of the notice of appeal. An extension of time should be granted in the circumstances. 
     
      
    3 The short facts giving rise to the charge were that on 18 May 2005 the appellant had flown into Sydney Kingsford Smith airport from Jamaica and was apprehended whilst carrying a suit bag containing two packages of cocaine sewn into its linings through Customs. 
     
      
    4 The appellant made various admissions, with the result that the only real issue at the trial was whether the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant knew that his baggage contained a quantity of the prohibited import and that he therefore intended to import the cocaine. 
     
      
       
      The evidence at the trial 
       
      
    5 The evidence at the trial was summarised in the Crown’s written submissions. No objection was taken to the summary which was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “On 26 April 2005 a return airline ticket from Sydney to Jamaica via Los Angeles was booked in the appellant’s name. The outward flight was on 5 May 2005 and the return flight on 17 May 2005 - though this was subsequently changed to 18 May 2005. The ticket was paid for in cash in the sum of $2750. 
        
       
       
        
        The appellant departed Australia on 5 May 2005. He checked in one item of baggage on the outgoing trip. He returned to Australia on 18 May 2005. Documentation seized from the appellant’s luggage upon his return indicated that he stayed at an establishment named ‘Big Apple’ whilst in Jamaica. 
        
       
       
        
        At 7.43 am on 18 May 2005, the appellant went through the primary line at Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport and presented his passport, ticket and incoming passenger card to Customs Officer Pauline Haddad. Having passed through the primary line, the appellant then proceeded to the baggage carousel and then approached Customs Officer Carol Farrelly. The appellant was carrying a suit bag and a duty free bag. It was the suit bag which in due course was found to have cocaine secreted within it. 
        
       
       
        
        The evidence of Customs Officer Farrelly was that she asked the appellant whether he had all his bags and, in response, the appellant ‘lifted his bags up and said “yes that’s all my bags”’. The appellant then answered some brief questions asked by Customs Officer Farrelly in relation to where he had been and how long he had been there. 
        
       
       
        
        The appellant was then directed to go to a particular baggage examination counter where he was spoken to by Customs Officer Hoyek. Customs Officer Hoyek asked the appellant a number of questions about his baggage, his knowledge of the contents of his baggage, whether he packed his bags himself, the nature of his trip and his occupation. Customs Officer Hoyek swabbed the appellant’s bag with a wand that was able to detect traces of narcotics. This swab produced a negative result. The officer then commenced an examination of the appellant’s baggage. During this examination she noticed that the suit bag appeared heavy. She then removed what appeared to be the only contents of the suitbag. She then observed that, despite being apparently empty, the bag still seemed full. 
        
       
       
        
        Customs Officer Hoyek’s evidence, which was not objected to, was that she then had a conversation with the appellant: 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you then say this: ‘Is there anything else in the bag or did I empty it out completely’? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
        Q. Did he then say, ‘No you have emptied it out’? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
        Q. Did you then ask ‘Why is it still so heavy’? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
        Q. Did he then reply, ‘I don’t know. Isn’t that the normal weight of the bag’? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
        Q. Did you then say, ‘No, it’s not. It should be lighter’? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
        Q. Did he then say, ‘It’s a good quality bag. Maybe that’s why its heavier’? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
        Q. Did he then further say, ‘Why? How much lighter should it be’? 
         
        A Yes. 
         
        Q. Did you then say, ‘Well, it should be lighter than what it is currently, anyway. I’m going to put the bag through the x-ray’? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Customs Officer Hoyek then asked Customs Officer Southwell to x-ray the suit bag. Also present was Customs Officer Vandam. Customs Officer Vandam had a conversation with the appellant during which the appellant told officer Vandam that he purchased the suit bag a few months previous for $85.00 at ‘Strandbags’ at North Ryde. There was evidence that Strandbags never had a store in North Ryde. 
        
       
       
        
        Following the initial x-ray, Customs Officer Vandam advised the appellant that there were ‘inconsistencies’ within the bag and he was going to take the bag to another area and may remove some of the stitching. The appellant said that ‘its quite an expensive bag’. 
        
       
       
        
        While the bag was being inspected, Customs Officer Hoyek had a further conversation with the appellant in relation to the suit bag. The evidence of Customs Officer Hoyek was as follows: 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you then say, ‘Did you check the bag on your way back from Jamaica to here?’ 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
        Q. Did he say, ‘I carried it the whole way from Jamaica to here’? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
        Q. Did you then say, ‘Why didn’t you check the bag in?’ 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
        Q. Did he reply: 
         
          
          ‘Because when I left from Sydney to Los Angeles I thought I had lost the bag in LA but didn’t realise they had checked it through all the way to Jamaica, so I decided on the way back I was going to carry it all the way just in case that happened again’? 
          
         
        A. Yes. 
         
        Q. Did you then say, ‘Okay, so what you’re saying is that your black suit bag didn’t leave your possession on your trip back’? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
        Q. Did he say, ‘That’s right’? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
        Q. Did you then say: 
         
          
          ‘And that you packed it in Jamaica in the hotel; took all your bags to the airport; then you didn’t check in any of your bags; that you carried all your bags on the plane with you from Jamaica through Los Angeles, all the way to Sydney. Is that right’? 
          
         
        A. Yes. 
         
        Q. Did he say, ‘That’s right’? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Whilst this conversation was occurring, other Customs Officers cut along the sewn lining of the suit bag and discovered, concealed within the lining, an object covered in brown tape between two foam mats. Within the brown tape wrapping the officers discovered a white pasty substance that was in due course tested and found to be cocaine. 
        
       
       
        
        The suit bag, with the appellant’s clothing and other possessions removed, but with packages of cocaine still within the lining, was weighed by Customs Officers. It weighed 5.215 kilograms. 
        
       
       
        
        The packages within the suit bag were in due course removed and analysed by officers of the Australian Federal Police. The gross weight of the cocaine was found to be 3.2259 kilograms. The cocaine had a purity of between 69.7% and 73.4%. Accordingly the weight of pure cocaine was estimated to be 2.3310 kilograms. Evidence was led without objection that the wholesale value of this amount of cocaine was $548,250. 
        
       
       
        
        The appellant was asked some further questions by Customs Officers at the airport. During that conversation, the following exchange occurred: 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you recall that you told me that you purchased the bag in North Sydney at a company called Strand Bag? 
         
        A. I recall our conversation. It was, it was out towards Ryde, North Ryde,. 
         
        Q. North Ryde? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
         
        Q. Yeah. 
         
        A. I did say that and I did say that it was purchased a few months ago from …(indistinct)…but I was guessing, guessing it was stolen. 
         
        Q. All right. Do you recall that - do you recall that you told me on our previous occasion at the duty barrier that the purchase price of the bag was eighty five dollars. Is that correct? 
         
        A. I was guessing the price it had. Look, I, I really, I’d rather not say anything until I’ve got some advice from here on in if that’s okay. If you’ll just let me know what’s going on, so.” 
        
       
       
        
        The accused gave evidence at the trial and was cross examined. He denied knowing anything about the cocaine that was found in his suit bag. His evidence included that he purchased the suit bag at a store in Burwood and was mistaken when he told the Customs Officers that he purchased the bag at Strandbags at North Ryde. His evidence was that when he packed his suitbag in Jamaica ‘it didn’t seem suspiciously heavy’ to him. He also said that ‘there wasn’t really a lot of security’ at his hotel in Jamaica. 
        
       
       
        
        The appellant called two other witnesses. The first was a friend of his, Ms Stynes, who gave evidence that she saw the appellant packing his bag the night before he left for Jamaica. Her evidence was that the bag she saw him packing was similar to the suitbag that the appellant returned to Australia with and that contained the cocaine. The second witness was a private investigator who had been retained by the appellant’s solicitors to travel to Jamaica and ‘test the veracity of the security of the hotel’.” 
        
       
       
      The grounds of appeal 
       
      
    6 The appellant relied upon five grounds of appeal. The first four grounds of appeal were as follows: 
     
      
       
      Ground 1:  
      The trial of the appellant miscarried through the use made by the Crown Prosecution of the evidence given by Customs Officer Carol Farrelly that the appellant had lifted the suit bag he was carrying to ‘about shoulder height’. This evidence was not apparently anticipated to be part of the prosecution case and was not the subject of any significant cross examination of the appellant, but it was given prominence in the closing address of the Crown as behaviour showing ‘cockiness’ on the part of the appellant and that it demonstrated him to be a person who was ‘over confident’ in the knowledge that he had drugs in the suit bag. This evidence was left to the jury in the summing up of the trial judge as a feature of the circumstantial case establishing the guilt of the appellant. 
       
       
      Ground 2:  
      The trial of the appellant miscarried by reason of the introduction into evidence of the opinion of prosecution witness regarding the weight of the suit bag carried by the appellant. 
       
       
      Ground 3:  
      The trial of the appellant miscarried through the introduction of evidence of the opinion of Federal Agent Ivan Perisa regarding the ‘nature of allegations involving corrupt baggage handlers at Qantas’, in particular the evidence led from the witness of the fact that these cases do not involve, in the words of the Crown Prosecutor, ‘an unknowing courier’ and again using the words of the Crown Prosecutor, that ‘they always involve a person who knows they have drugs’. These questions introduced the fact of knowledge of drug couriers that there were drugs imported in other cases which was essentially, irrelevant to the case against the appellant. 
       
       
      Ground 4:  
      The trial miscarried by reason of questions asked in cross examination of the appellant by the Crown Prosecutor, which implied that the appellant should call two named persons to give evidence, accompanied by the further implication that the appellant’s failure to call those named persons as witnesses was of relevance or significance. 
       
      
    7 No objection was taken at the trial by counsel for the appellant to any of the matters raised by those grounds of appeal. Senior counsel, who appeared on the appeal (but not at the trial), accepted that he required the leave of the Court pursuant to r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to rely upon those grounds. 
     
      
    8 The Court refused leave under r 4 in respect of appeal grounds 1-4 and indicated that it would provide its reasons with the substantive judgment 
     
      
    9 Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “No direction, omission to direct, or decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence given by the judge presiding at the trial, shall, without the leave of the court, be allowed as a ground for appeal or an application for leave to appeal unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction, omission or decision by the party appealing or applying for leave to appeal.” 
        
       
      
    10 The requirements of r 4 do not constitute some mere technicality which may simply be brushed aside - R v Abusafiah (1991) 24 NSWLR 531 at 536. 
     
      
    11 In R v Tripodina (1988) 35 A Crim R 183 at 191 this court held: 
     
      
       
        
        “…it is the duty of counsel appearing at the trial to take objection to matters which, in their view, are irregular, or which might be unduly prejudicial to their client, and in particular to raise, in relation to the summing up, any matters which the trial judge may have overlooked or which, in their view, he has put erroneously.” 
        
       
      
    12 A failure by counsel to perform this duty may be explicable because: 
     
      
      (a) he overlooked the point or was unaware of the law on the subject; 
       
      (b) he deliberately said nothing hoping to gain a tactical advantage at a later stage; or 
       
      (c) he took no objection as, in the atmosphere of the trial, he saw no injustice or error in what was done -  
      Tripodina 
       (at 193 and 191). 
       
      
    13 Generally speaking, leave under r 4 will only be granted where an irregularity has occurred which is such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings - Tripodina (at 195) or as Mahoney JA said in R v Jeffrey (Court of Criminal Appeal, 16 December 1993, unreported, at 6-7) - followed in R v DH [2000] NSWCCA 360: 
     
      
       
        
        “…unless there be a convincing reason why the matter was not raised at the trial and unless the possibility of real injustice appears, an accused should be held to what was done by or for him at trial level.” 
        
       
      
    14 The onus of establishing that leave should be granted lay with the appellant. Senior counsel for the appellant conceded that Ground 2 did not go to the root of the proceedings. He submitted that Grounds 1, 3 and 4 did and in relation to Ground 4 he referred to R v Soto-Sanchez [2002] NSWCCA 160, (2002) 129 A Crim R 279 and submitted that, as a result of the questions asked by the prosecution, there was a real risk of reversing the onus of proof and accordingly leave should be granted.  
     
      
    15 This was not a case where any of the objections now sought to be taken were of such a nature that leave should be granted in the absence of an explanation as to why the objections were not taken at the trial. No convincing reasons were advanced on appeal as to why the objections were not taken at the trial. Counsel for the appellant at the trial was very experienced. He took none of the objections now sought to be relied upon. This was a powerful indication of how the objections now raised should be viewed. It was also a powerful indication that error, if such occurred, was not error of a kind which might produce a miscarriage of justice - R v Button (2002) 129 A Crim R 242. 
     
      
    16 In the opinion of the Court, the matters complained of did not go to the root of the proceedings, nor did it appear that the matters complained of were other than matters which counsel for the appellant, in the atmosphere of the trial, saw as involving no injustice or error. The evidence of lifting the suit bag was relevant, it was not objected to and its weight was for the jury. The evidence concerning Qantas baggage handlers came in response to the defence raising that corrupt Qantas baggage handlers had been involved in drug importations which, if relevant, permitted explanation of the witnesses’ knowledge of the nature of the importations. Any implication that the applicant should have called other witnesses is not easy to see, and if it was apparent at the trial the appellant’s counsel apparently did not think it of significance. This was not a case where a real risk of reversing the onus of proof existed. The objections, if taken at the trial, could have been dealt with by the trial judge at that time. The Court confirms its conclusion that no leave pursuant to r 4 should be granted. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5: The verdict of the jury is unreasonable having regard to the evidence 
       
      
    17 The Crown case, in relation to the appellant’s knowledge of the cocaine secreted in his suit bag, was circumstantial. In her closing address, the Crown Prosecutor drew attention to a number of circumstances from which, it was submitted, the jury would infer, beyond reasonable doubt, knowledge of the cocaine on the part of the appellant. The circumstances included the following, as fairly summarised in the Crown submissions on appeal - 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) The fact that the appellant brought the cocaine into Australia in his own suitbag. The Crown drew attention to the implausibility of a scenario whereby a person or persons, without the knowledge of the appellant, would conceal over half a million dollars worth of cocaine in the appellant’s suitbag in the absence of any obvious way of recovering the cocaine without the accused knowing once the appellant and his baggage had arrived in Australia. There was no arrangement for the appellant to hand the bag to someone upon his arrival in Australia. The appellant did not give anyone that he socialized with in Jamaica his address in Australia. The point was that this supposedly alternative scenario was not a rational or reasonable hypothesis. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) The cocaine was apparently tailor made for and sewn into the lining of the suitbag. It was not simply placed in the bag. It could not have been quickly and easily inserted in the bag (for example by an intruder in the appellant’s hotel room) without the knowledge of the appellant. The opportunities to do so would not be great. It would also not have been quick and easy for someone to remove the cocaine. It was a professional concealment. 
        
       
       
        
        (c) The suitbag weighed over 5 kilograms (because of the presence of the cocaine) when it was apparently empty. The suggestion was that this unusual and suspicious feature of the bag would have been obvious to the appellant during his return voyage. 
        
       
       
        
        (d) The appellant’s demeanour at the airport when first spoken to by Customs Officer Farrelly: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            He [the appellant] approached her [officer Farrelly], she asked him, after he said where are the exits, she asked him words to the effect ‘is this all your luggage’ and he held up his luggage. Now it wasn’t light you might think, it was at least 12 to 13 kilos that suit bag and he held it up to shoulder height when he was apparently delirious with fatigue, or almost delirious with fatigue, another factor, an important factor. In fact his evidence was ‘I felt extremely tired, almost delirious and jet lagged would be the best term for it’. They were his precise words he used, yet he held up the bag like that. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            As I put to him about that, you might think that’s consistent with a rush of adrenalin, a bit of perhaps even cockiness as he comes through knowing or believing that he has got the drugs in the bag. Sort of over confident, look I’ve only got this, I’m innocent, I have got nothing in my bag. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (e) On the appellant’s own account, the suit bag was his own, was packed by him and only he was to have custody of it. It remained in his custody or control during the entire trip home because he took it on the aircraft as cabin baggage. 
        
       
       
        
        (f) The appellant changed his initial story about where he bought the suitbag from. His original claim that he bought it from Strandbags in North Ryde was proved to be false. 
        
       
       
        
        (g) The Crown also drew attention to a number of implausible or inconsistent aspects of the appellant’s evidence relating to his purchase of the suitbag in Burwood and the particular features he was looking for, the purchase of the ticket in cash by his friend, the unusual nature of the appellant’s trip to Jamaica (he travelled alone, which was unusual for him; he stayed in the one place for the entire trip and socialized with taxi drivers and an interpreter; he purchased a telephone in Jamaica), his evidence that there was lax security at his hotel (yet he kept a large amount of cash and his other documents in his room). Nothing was apparently moved or disturbed in his room in Jamaica. His money was not stolen.” 
        
       
      
    18 In M v The Queen (1994)181 CLR 487 at 493 Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations.” 
        
       
      
    19 Senior counsel for the appellant considered each of the matters referred to in para [17] (a)-(f) individually. He asserted, in essence:  
     
      
      (a) the appellant was an innocent dupe; 
       
      (b) the fact that there was no obvious way of recovering the cocaine was not established. There were obvious ways of recovering the cocaine if the people at the end, from where the cocaine is imported, are given information, and sufficient information to identify the person who has had the cocaine, as it were, planted on them; 
       
      (c) whilst he accepted that the sewing of the packages of cocaine into the suit bag could not have been done quickly and easily, it was something that professionals operating in the field with the high stakes involved and with the skills that they may be expected to have, would reasonably be anticipated to be able to find their way into a hotel room and to secrete this material in a bag without the person knowing; 
       
      (d) the additional weight in the bag caused by the presence of the heroin was not so significant when there were a large number of other items in the bag; 
       
      (e) a reliable inference as to knowledge could not be drawn from the reference to the appellant’s demeanour being one of over confidence; 
       
      (f) the fact that the suit bag was the appellant’s own and packed by him and only he had custody of it was not particularly remarkable or unusual in the context of luggage that was carried onto an aeroplane; 
       
      (g) the fact that the original claim as to where the suit bag was purchased was proved to be false was not a matter of great moment as it was quite conceivable that a person might be genuinely mistaken in this regard. 
       
      
    20 We do not find such an analysis convincing, particularly as it does not give adequate recognition to the fact that in a circumstantial case the probative force of the evidence derives from its accumulation and not from individual items of evidence taken alone. 
     
      
    21 In our opinion, it was extremely unlikely that the importation into Australia of a commercial quantity of cocaine valued at over half a million dollars would be trusted to a person who was unaware of its presence and in the absence of any obvious way of recovering it without that person’s knowledge. 
     
      
    22 It was also, in our opinion, improbable that without the appellant’s knowledge someone was able to enter his room, carry out the work of sewing the packages of cocaine into the lining of the suit bag and leave the suit bag apparently untouched. 
     
      
    23 When those factors, together with the other matters referred to in para [17] are considered, it is, in our opinion, clear that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. The more so when full regard is had to the fact that the jury had the benefit of seeing and hearing the witnesses, and in particular the appellant, give evidence and were determining an issue which involved a consideration of the evidence in the light of the common experience of human affairs.  
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    24 The orders of the Court are: 
     
      
       
      1. The time in which to file the notice of appeal is extended to the date the notice of appeal was filed. 
       
       
      2. Appeal dismissed.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 JOHNSON J: By Amended Summons filed 21 July 2008, the Plaintiff, the Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW), seeks relief arising from the dismissal at Ryde Local Court on 23 January 2008 by the Second Defendant, Magistrate O’Shane, of a charge of negligent driving occasioning grievous bodily harm against the First Defendant, Kim Soon Yeo. 
     
      
    2 The Plaintiff appeals under s.56(1)(c) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 alleging error of law on the part of the Second Defendant and, in the alternative, seeks prerogative relief upon the basis that the Second Defendant fell into jurisdictional error and denied the prosecutor procedural fairness. 
     
      
       
      Hearing in the Local Court 
       
      
    3 On 23 January 2008, the First Defendant appeared, represented by a solicitor, in response to a Court Attendance Notice first returnable on that day which alleged the offence of negligent driving occasioning grievous bodily harm contrary to s.42 (1)(b) Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999. The maximum penalty for that offence is a fine of 20 penalty units or imprisonment for nine months or both (in the case of a first offence). 
     
      
    4 The First Defendant’s solicitor, Mr Nixon, entered a plea of guilty and, in accordance with usual practice, a Statement of Facts was handed to the Second Defendant. 
     
      
    5 The Statement of Facts revealed that, at approximately 6.15 pm on Saturday, 4 August 2007, the First Defendant was driving his vehicle west on Terry Road, Eastwood. At the same time, Graham Lade was riding his bicycle east on Terry Road. At the intersection of Terry Road and Valley Road, a T-intersection, the First Defendant slowed to make a right turn into Valley Road. He proceeded into the eastbound lane of Terry Road at a speed of about 10-20 kph and collided with the front wheel of Mr Lade’s bicycle, causing Mr Lade to be propelled from his seat into the air and thrown about five to eight metres forward in an easterly direction, where he landed heavily on the grassed nature strip on the north-eastern corner of the intersection. The bicycle was propelled a further five metres east landing about 10-15 metres east of the point of impact. The First Defendant immediately stopped his vehicle in Valley Road and attended to Mr Lade. Damage to the First Defendant’s vehicle was minor, with dents in the front bonnet and bumper/registration plate area.  
     
      
    6 Police attended and the First Defendant was subjected to a roadside breath test which was negative. In response to questions by police, the First Defendant said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I came to the intersection of Valley Road and slowed down ready to make my right turn. I did not see any cars or anything else and so I started to turn. All of a sudden I see something fly up into the air. I turned into Valley Road and stopped straight away and ran over to see a male lying on the corner on the nature strip.” 
        
       
      
    7 He told police that he was driving at a “slow speed, about 10-20 kph” when he was turning right. He told police that he did not see any safety lights or reflective indicators coming towards him prior to the collision.  
     
      
    8 At the time of the collision, the road surface was dry-sealed bitumen and traffic was light. The weather was overcast, it was night time and the street lighting was illuminated.  
     
      
    9 The First Defendant was 51 years old at the time of the collision and had been driving in New South Wales since 1988. 
     
      
    10 Following the collision, Mr Lade was treated at the scene and then conveyed to Westmead Hospital for treatment. Injuries sustained by him in the collision included a right proximal humeral fracture, intra-articular head split type (right shoulder fracture), a segmental fracture of the clavicle (broken collar bone), right rib fractures, cup and ball joint fracture, left knee lacerations requiring stitches and grazes to his buttocks and right hand. He underwent surgery on 8 August 2007 to intra-operatively stabilise the fracture with three screws. Following this treatment, Mr Lade required extensive physiotherapy and ongoing rehabilitation.  
     
      
    11 All that I have said in [5]-[10] above has been drawn from the Statement of Facts handed to her Honour following the entry of the plea of guilty on 23 January 2008. It was common ground before me, as is obvious, that Mr Lade had the right of way so that the First Defendant was required to give way to him. 
     
      
    12 After being handed the Statement of Facts, the following exchange took place between her Honour and the prosecutor (T1-2, 23 January 2008): 
     
      
       
        
        “HER HONOUR: I will just take a short time to read these documents. I have a difficulty with these facts, Sergeant. The fact that the present accused collided with the - was it a motor cycle or a bicycle? 
        
       
       
        
        PROSECUTOR: Bicycle. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: Is not of itself evidence of negligence. Where was the - there is nothing in these facts to say what direction the bicycle was travelling in, where it was in the roadway, there’s just nothing here. I’m looking for it and I can’t see it, unless I’ve missed something altogether. 
        
       
       
        
        PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, perhaps the matter might be put over so I can have the facts amended again to include that information. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: Do you have the information. If the information isn’t contained in the facts then that’s it. After all, when did this - this happened - it is alleged the incident occurred on 4 August which is, let’s face it, five months ago. Actually, it is almost six months ago.  
        
       
       
        
        PROSECUTOR: The police referred the matter to the Serious Motor Vehicle Collision protocol and were waiting for a response. They only..  
        [not transcribable]  
        .. and they are still waiting for medical reports.  
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: Well that’s not good enough, is it. If this is the return date and the Defendant has an option of pleading guilty then the matter has to be ready to proceed on a full account of what occurred. There is nothing in these facts to suggest negligence. With a matter of negligence it is not a situation of res ipsa loquitur, the facts speak for itself, it isn’t. On the facts, this information should simply be dismissed out of hand, that’s it.  
        
       
       
        
        PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, I can only ask for an adjournment to enable the Prosecution to amend the facts.  
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: Is the prosecution going to be capable of amending the facts? 
        
       
       
        
        PROSECUTOR: I believe so your Honour, I have a brief of evidence here but . 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: You have a brief of evidence there? You are entitled to hand up statements on a plea of guilty but I just don’t know why a plea of guilty is being entered, I have to say, Mr Nixon. The facts simply do not disclose an offence of negligence. As I said, the fact that there was a collision is not, of itself, evidence of negligent driving. I have read the statement made by the driver at the time. The weather was overcast but the road surface was dry, traffic was light, it was night-time, street lighting was illuminated, which doesn’t really tell us anything very much at all. 
        
       
       
        
        NIXON: As I understand, there was a light fitted to the bike which wasn’t on. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: It wasn’t on, on your instructions? 
        
       
       
        
        NIXON: On my instructions. My client tells me that the first he knew that he had hit anything … 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: I’ve read the facts do you have something further to hand up to me, Sergeant? 
        
       
       
        
        PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, I can hand up the cyclist’s statement.  
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: Do you have anything further from the informant than what’s contained in the facts? 
        
       
       
        
        PROSECUTOR: The statement from the cyclist certainly indicates further information other than what’s contained in the facts. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: That doesn’t actually tell me anything either, does it? His account is from his point of view and is, essentially, the same account as the driver tells from his point of view. No. If that’s as high as it goes then it’s not good enough. 
        
       
       
        
        THE INFORMATION IS DISMISSED. 
        
       
       
        
        He is free to go.” 
        
       
      
    13 What appears in the preceding paragraph represents the entirety of what took place following the entry of the plea of guilty before the Second Defendant. The bench sheet which is in evidence (Annexure A, affidavit of RV Paul, 7 April 2008) records that a plea of guilty was entered and that the matter was “dismissed”. No other order is noted whereby the plea of guilty was rejected or withdrawn. 
     
      
       
      Submissions of the Parties 
       
      
    14 Mr Bourke, counsel for the Plaintiff, submitted that a number of errors of law had been demonstrated in this case: 
     
      
       
      (a) there was no basis in law for the Second Defendant to have found, effectively, that there was no prima facie case of negligence - such a finding was contrary to the plea of guilty which constituted an admission of the elements of the offence and the matters contained in the Statement of Facts; 
       
       
      (b) if the Second Defendant did not accept the plea of guilty, such a finding ought to have been recorded, a plea of not guilty entered and the proceedings adjourned for hearing at a later date: ss.190, 193(2), 194, 195, 202  
      Criminal Procedure Act 1986 
      ; 
       
       
      (c) in proceeding as she did, the Second Defendant had acted contrary to the statutory scheme contained in Division 3, Part 4 of Chapter 4  
      Criminal Procedure Act 1986  
      (ss.190-210), which contained the appropriate steps required by law with respect to a summary hearing in the Local Court; 
       
       
      (d) if her Honour intended to entertain an application by the First Defendant for leave to withdraw his plea of guilty, it was necessary for the Court to proceed in accordance with the principles laid down in  
      Wong v Director of Public Prosecutions  
      (2005) 155 A Crim R 37 - her Honour did not comply with the law in this respect; 
       
       
      (e) in refusing the prosecution application for adjournment, the Second Defendant failed to comply with the requirements of the  
      Criminal Procedure Act 1986 
      , including s.202, thereby denying the prosecutor procedural fairness:  
      Director of Public Prosecutions v Wunderwald  
      [2004] NSWSC 182; 
       
       
      (f) finally, in purporting to dismiss the charge, the Second Defendant failed to give reasons as required by law for this determination: s.202  
      Criminal Procedure Act 1986 
      ;  
      Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Illawarra Cashmart Pty Limited  
      (2006) 67 NSWLR 402 at 408 [19]. 
       
      
    15 Mr Bourke submitted that it appeared that the Second Defendant had either misread or misunderstood the evidence tendered by consent on the plea of guilty, given her initial queries concerning the absence of certain facts. It is apparent from [5]-[10] above, that a clear summary of the facts had been provided to her Honour following the plea of guilty, and this was supplemented by the statement of Mr Lade which did not contradict anything contained in the Statement of Facts but supported it.  
     
      
    16 Mr Bourke submitted that an order should be made under s.59(2)(a) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 setting aside the order of dismissal and remitting the matter to the Local Court for hearing before a Magistrate other than the Second Defendant. He submitted that such an order was appropriate in this case given the course taken by the Second Defendant at the hearing on 23 January 2008: Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Neamati [2007] NSWSC 746 at [31].  
     
      
    17 Ms Orman-Hales, counsel for the First Defendant, submitted that the Plaintiff had not demonstrated error with respect to the course of proceedings in the Local Court and that, even if some error had been demonstrated, that relief ought be refused on discretionary grounds. 
     
      
    18 She submitted that, on the material before the Local Court, the Second Defendant was correct in concluding, effectively, that there was no prima facie case of negligence. Reference was made to Clout v Hutchinson (1950) 51 SR(NSW) 32 where Street CJ observed at 35 that negligent driving (under then s.4 Motor Traffic Act 1909) was “something less serious than reckless or furious driving” and involved a “different and lesser degree of negligence” than that which was necessary to prove an offence of negligent act causing grievous bodily harm under s.54 Crimes Act 1900. 
     
      
    19 Ms Orman-Hales submitted that it was open to the Second Defendant not to accept the First Defendant’s plea of guilty. Although it was nowhere noted, Ms Orman-Hales submitted, in effect, that her Honour did not accept the plea of guilty and proceeded thereafter to consider the material which had been tendered by the prosecutor. Having done so, Ms Orman-Hales submitted that the Second Defendant concluded, correctly, that there was no prima facie case to support the element of negligence. Although no application was made for leave to withdraw the plea of guilty, Ms Orman-Hales submitted that the appropriate conclusion is that her Honour did not accept the plea of guilty. 
     
      
    20 Ms Orman-Hales submitted that no error had been demonstrated in the refusal to adjourn the proceedings. This was a discretionary matter and it was open to the Second Defendant to conclude that the prosecutor had placed the necessary material before the Court in the form of the Statement of Facts and Mr Lade’s statement, and that no purpose would be served by adjourning the proceedings. She also submitted that the prosecutor ought to have had all available documentary material at the Court on the first return date, so that it might be provided to the Court if needed.  
     
      
    21 If a basis for relief was demonstrated, Ms Orman-Hales submitted that the matter ought not be remitted to the Local Court or, if it was to be remitted, that this Court should make an order allowing the plea of guilty to be withdrawn. Ms Orman-Hales accepted that it was open to the Court to remit the matter to the Local Court to be heard before a Magistrate other than the Second Defendant, but submitted that such an order ought not be made in this case.  
     
      
       
      The Statutory Offence of Negligent Driving 
       
      
    22 Before moving to resolve the issues raised in these proceedings, it is appropriate to make some observations concerning the offence of negligent driving. 
     
      
    23 A person must not drive a motor vehicle negligently on a road or road-related area: s.42(1) Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999. If the negligent driving occasions grievous bodily harm, the maximum penalty (in the case of a first offence) is a fine of 20 penalty units or imprisonment for nine months or both: s.42(1)(b).  
     
      
    24 Section 42(3) is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(3) In considering whether an offence has been committed under this section, the court is to have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the following: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the nature, condition and use of the road or road related area on which the offence is alleged to have been committed, 
           
           
          (b) the amount of traffic that actually is at the time, or which might reasonably be expected to be, on the road or road related area.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    25 The offences of negligent driving occasioning death or grievous bodily harm were introduced by amendment to s.4 of the Traffic Act 1909 by the Traffic (Driving Offences) Amendment Bill 1994. 
     
      
    26 The statutory offence of negligent driving in s.42(1) is the successor to the offence of negligent driving originally enacted in s.4 Motor Traffic Act 1909. The history of this offence, and its relationship with culpable driving under s.52A Crimes Act 1900 and manslaughter, was considered by O’Brien CJ of CrD (Street CJ and Nagle CJ at CL agreeing) in R v Buttsworth (1983) 1 NSWLR 658 at 664ff.  
     
      
    27 Negligent driving is established where it is proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused person drove a motor vehicle in a manner involving a departure from the standard of care for other users of the road to be expected of the ordinary prudent driver in the circumstances. The distinction which may be drawn between driving negligently, driving in a manner dangerous to the public and driving of a kind which justifies a conviction for manslaughter is essentially a distinction in the degree of negligence appropriate to the offence, being a distinction in the degree of departure from the standard of care for other users of the road to be expected of the ordinary prudent driver in the circumstances: R v Buttsworth at 672.  
     
      
    28 The provision now contained in s.42(3) demonstrates that the statutory offence of negligent driving may be committed although there may be no other traffic on the road, if other traffic might reasonably be expected to be there: R v Buttsworth at 667-668. 
     
      
    29 The question is essentially whether the driver was exercising that degree of care which the ordinary prudent driver would exercise in all the circumstances, including the circumstances as set out in s.42(3): Simpson v Peat [1952] 2 QB 24. 
     
      
    30 To prove the offence of negligent driving under s.42(1), it is not necessary that there be any injury to a person or damage to property: R v Buttsworth at 667-668. Of course, if the negligent driving occasions death or grievous bodily harm, the driver will be liable to a higher maximum penalty: s.42(1)(a) and (b).  
     
      
    31 In R v Buttsworth at 682, O’Brien CJ of CrD said: 
     
      
       
        
        “If, therefore, it were necessary to deal with the offence of manslaughter by criminal negligence and the offence of culpable driving, it would, I should think, obviously be necessary to indicate to the jury the differing standards of neglect for the safety of the public as other road users liable to be affected by the three standards in ascending order if the jury were to have any realistic appreciation of what the law was talking about in offences of manslaughter and of culpable driving and how they stood in relation to the well-known summary offence of negligent driving and the standard of negligence it involves.” 
        
       
      
    32 It is clear that negligent driving is to be regarded as something less serious than reckless or furious driving or driving at a speed or in a manner dangerous to the public (all offences contained in s.42(2) of the Act): Clout v Hutchinson at 35. In Ex parte Graham; re Dowling (1968) 88 WN(Pt1)(NSW) 270, Asprey JA observed at 282: 
     
      
       
        
        “Like the tort of negligence, ‘negligent driving’ is difficult to reduce to a set of rules. It covers a multitude of sins. It relates to the circumstances of the occasion. What would constitute the offence in one instance would pass without censure in another.” 
        
       
      
    33 Given an observation made by the Second Defendant in this case concerning res ipsa loquitur, it is appropriate to refer to other authority. In Ex parte Musgrove; re Howard (1961) 78 WN(NSW) 88, Collins J at 89 observed that the “so called doctrine or principle of res ipsa loquitur can find no place in criminal law”. It is important to place this comment in context. Collins J made this statement in the course of determining an appeal from a magistrate who approached the determination of a summary charge of negligent driving by applying the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, and then proceeded to hold that the defendant had not discharged the onus of proving his innocence.  
     
      
    34 In R v Cains (NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, 7 April 1971) 2 Petty Sessions Review 796, O’Brien J (as his Honour then was) (in delivering the judgment of the Court) referred to Ex parte Musgrove; re Howard and said (at 804-805): 
     
      
       
        
        “His Honour  
        [Collins J in  
        Ex parte Musgrove; re Howard 
        ] 
         agreed with submissions that if the phrase  
        [res ipsa loquitur]  
        has any place in the language of the criminal law, it can only be used to describe a factual situation where the prosecution’s case is based on circumstantial evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        Turning to the Magistrate’s judgment, his Honour said it was clear that ‘having first introduced a statement of the phrase res ipsa loquitur, he then proceeds to hold that the onus of proving his innocence was on the accused person, and convicted him because he had not discharged this onus’. 
        
       
       
        
        This, of course, was clearly wrong, even if the maxim be used in civil law, and the Magistrate, so far as the charge before him was concerned, was bound to consider whether, on the whole of the evidence, the offence had been established by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt. He ordered the rule to be made absolute because, as he said, ‘the Magistrate was in error in holding that the applicant was guilty of the said offence, not because there was no evidence that the applicant was guilty, but because the reasons that he gave for finding him guilty completely vitiate his decision’. 
        
       
       
        
        From this decision it can be seen in the first instance that his Honour did not hold that in a circumstance where a car leaves the road for no established reason it is not open to a Magistrate to infer, in the circumstances of the case before him, that the prosecution has not established the offence of negligent driving beyond reasonable doubt. 
        
       
       
        
        In this case, the submissions of counsel at the trial, did not correctly represent the grounds of the decision of the case he cited. 
        
       
       
        
        More importantly, it can be seen that in this judgment nothing can be found which requires, as a matter of law or as a desirable practice, that in an offence arising out of a collision on a road, the jury should be directed that they could not draw any inference of criminal conduct from a so-called unexplained accident.  
        
       
       
        
        Of course, the decision could be used for the proposition, if authority were really needed, that the jury should not be told to follow some such process as the Magistrate there followed. It was not suggested, of course, before me that the learned Chairman had made any such suggestion.” 
        
       
      
    35 A negligent driving case, like any other case, may depend largely or entirely on circumstantial evidence. In the absence of an admission by the driver charged, the case may fall to be determined by application of principles relevant to a circumstantial case, including the drawing of inferences from proved facts.  
     
      
    36 To establish a prima facie case in a prosecution based upon circumstantial evidence, it is necessary for the prosecution to show, at the close of its case, that an inference consistent with guilt reasonably arose on the evidence. It does not have to prove that this was the only inference that arose or that there was no inference arising from the evidence inconsistent with guilt: R v JMR (1991) 57 A Crim R 39 at 43-44; R v Serratore (1999) 48 NSWLR 101 at 130; Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Neamati at [14].  
     
      
    37 Putting aside, for the moment, the First Defendant’s plea of guilty, the Statement of Facts and Mr Lade’s statement provided the foundation for a very clear inference that the First Defendant was not keeping a proper lookout, and was not driving with due care and attention (and had thus departed from the standard of care for other road users to be expected of an ordinary prudent driver) when he made the right-hand turn from Terry Road into Valley Road, Eastwood, on the evening in question, driving straight into Mr Lade’s bicycle which had the right of way.  
     
      
    38 It might be thought that this very clear inference serves to explain the plea of guilty entered on the First Defendant’s behalf by his solicitor. 
     
      
       
      Determination 
       
      
    39 The Plaintiff has demonstrated error of law in a number of respects in these proceedings. I regret to say that the course taken by the Second Defendant at Ryde Local Court on 23 January 2008 bore little resemblance to what was required by law under applicable statutory and common law principles. 
     
      
    40 The First Defendant appeared together with a solicitor and a plea of guilty was entered to the charge. A court should approach such a step upon the basis that the plea announced in open court, in the presence of the First Defendant, represented his instructions to his solicitor: R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 at 683-684. Thereafter, no application was made by the First Defendant for leave to withdraw the plea of guilty.  
     
      
    41 A person charged with an offence is at liberty to plead guilty or not guilty to the charge, whether or not that person is in truth guilty or nor guilty, and a Court will act on a plea of guilty when it is entered in open court by a person who is of full age and apparently of sound mind and understanding, provided the plea is entered in exercise of a free choice in the interest of the person entering the plea: Meissner v The Queen [1994-1995] 184 CLR 132 at 141.  
     
      
    42 A person may plead guilty upon grounds which extend beyond that person’s belief in his guilt, and the entry of a plea of guilty upon such grounds nevertheless constitutes an admission of all the elements of the offence, and a conviction entered upon the basis of such a plea will not be set aside on appeal unless it can be shown that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, and this will normally only arise where the accused person did not understand the nature of the charge, or did not intend by his plea to admit his guilt of it: Meissner v The Queen at 157; Wong v Director of Public Prosecutions at 45-46.  
     
      
    43 Where an application is made for leave to withdraw a plea of guilty, evidence ought be adduced from the accused person as to the circumstances in which he or she came to plead guilty: Wong v Director of Public Prosecutions at 40 [14].44 In Maxwell v The Queen [1995-1996] 184 CLR 501, Dawson and McHugh JJ said at 510-511: 
     
      
       
        
        “An accused is entitled to plead guilty to an offence with which he is charged and, if he does so, the plea will constitute an admission of all the essential elements of the offence. Of course, if the trial judge forms the view that the evidence does not support the charge or that for any other reason the charge is not supportable, he should advise the accused to withdraw his plea and plead not guilty. But he cannot compel an accused to do so and if the accused refuses, the plea must be considered final, subject only to the discretion of the judge to grant leave to change the plea to one of not guilty at any time before the matter is disposed of by sentence or otherwise.  
         
         
        The plea of guilty must however be unequivocal and not made in circumstances suggesting that it is not a true admission of guilt. Those circumstances include ignorance, fear, duress, mistake or even the desire to gain a technical advantage. The plea may be accompanied by a qualification indicating that the accused is unaware of its significance. If it appears to the trial judge, for whatever reason, that a plea of guilty is not genuine, he or she must (and it is not a matter of discretion) obtain an unequivocal plea of guilty or direct that a plea of not guilty be entered 
        . 
         But otherwise an accused may insist upon pleading guilty.” 
        
       
      
    45 These principles surrounding acceptance or rejection of a plea of guilty, apply in the Local Court under s.193(2) Criminal Procedure Act 1986. It has been said that, where the accused person’s version of the facts is inconsistent with the plea of guilty, the court should give the defence an opportunity to withdraw the plea and, if that does not occur and the accused person insists upon pleading guilty, the court should ignore the accused person’s version: R v Martin (1904) 4 SR(NSW) 720; Marlow v R [1990] 1 Tas SR 1; Blazevski v Judges of the District Court (NSW Court of Appeal, 10 November 1992, BC9101492) (1992) 62 ALD 197 at 208-209, 212-213.  
     
      
    46 Where a Magistrate determines under s.193(2) not to accept the accused person’s guilty plea on the first return date, a plea of not guilty ought be entered and the court must set the date, time and place for the hearing and determination of the matter: s.190(1) Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 
     
      
    47 It will be apparent that none of these statutory or common law principles were applied by the Second Defendant in the present case. Both the transcript of the proceedings and the record of the Local Court disclose a plea of guilty being entered which, although criticised by her Honour, was not rejected or withdrawn by leave. By that plea, the First Defendant admitted the essential elements of the offence, including negligence. Yet the Second Defendant dismissed the charge. Clear error of law is revealed in these circumstances.  
     
      
    48 If the view is taken that her Honour, without recording such an order, rejected the plea of guilty, a further question arises. Her Honour took the view that the Statement of Facts and the statement of Mr Lade did not disclose negligence. Reference was made to the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur having no application.  
     
      
    49 Her Honour’s earlier exchange with the prosecutor concerning the suggested lack of factual information in the material is difficult to understand given the contents of the Statement of Facts which I have summarised earlier in this judgment. If her Honour was to reach the point of considering the sufficiency of the evidence by reference to the element of negligence, then the question involved consideration of inferences available from the undisputed facts. There was a very clear inference available that the First Defendant had not acted in accordance with the standards of the ordinary prudent driver in that he failed to keep a proper lookout and failed to pay proper attention so that he did not see the oncoming bicycle (which had the right of way) with which he collided whilst doing a right-hand turn.  
     
      
    50 If the matter had proceeded to a defended hearing, arguments may have been advanced concerning the visibility of the bicycle, although I note that Mr Lade’s statement recorded that he had reflective shoes, a front light mounted on his bike and a red flashing light on the rear and that the lights were working at the time of the collision. However, the Second Defendant had before her the admission of negligence conveyed by the plea of guilty, together with a very strong inference of negligence arising from the Statement of Facts.  
     
      
    51 In this Court, both counsel submitted that the Second Defendant concluded (although this was not stated expressly) that there was no prima facie case of negligence. In doing so, I am satisfied that a clear error of law was committed both by disregarding the plea of guilty, and failing to apply the appropriate legal test to reach the necessary conclusion by reference to inferences arising from the evidence placed before the Local Court. 
     
      
    52 Further, I am satisfied that the Second Defendant has failed to comply with statutory procedures in the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 and denied the prosecutor procedural fairness by declining to adjourn the proceedings. 
     
      
    53 In Nitiva v Director of Public Prosecutions [1999] NSWCA 332, the Court of Appeal (Sheller and Beazley JJA, Cole AJA) observed at [64], in the context of a claim of denial of procedural fairness by a refusal to adjourn criminal proceedings: 
     
      
       
        
        “The principles upon which an adjournment ought to be granted are well established. The court has a discretion to grant or refuse an adjournment. However, a refusal to grant an adjournment can, in certain circumstances, constitute a denial of procedural fairness: see  
        Sullivan v Department of Transport 
         (1978) 20 ALR 323. As Deane J said in that case at ALR 343 ‘it is important to remember that the relevant duty of [the court] is to ensure that a party is given a reasonable opportunity to present his case’. In our opinion, the claimant was not given that reasonable opportunity.” 
        
       
      
    54 In Blazevski v Judges of the District Court, Kirby P (as his Honour then was) said at 200: 
     
      
       
        
        “Courts providing judicial review to rectify departures from the requirements of procedural fairness will likewise give relief for departures from such requirements which will have been taken by the trial court outside the proper exercise of its jurisdiction. In criminal cases, they will do so where the injustice has been done to the prosecution as well as to the accused.” 
        
       
      
    55 If the Second Defendant rejected the plea of guilty, the Court ought to have proceeded to set the date, time and place for the hearing and determination of the matter: s.190(1). Thereafter, a Magistrate would determine the matter after hearing the accused person, prosecutor, witnesses and evidence in accordance with s.202 Criminal Procedure Act 1986. That did not occur in this case. It is no answer to this conclusion to assert that the prosecutor had an opportunity to place before the Second Defendant on 23 January 2008 the Statement of Facts and the statement of Mr Lade.  
     
      
    56 Leaving aside, for the moment, the fact that a plea of guilty had been entered and that the evidence before the Local Court was supportive of the guilt of the First Defendant, if the matter was not to proceed to finality pursuant to the plea of guilty that day, the prosecutor was entitled to have the proceedings adjourned so that the witnesses could be called, and submissions made, in light of the evidence adduced at the hearing. In accordance with the principle referred to in Nitiva v Director of Public Prosecutions, the duty of the Court was to ensure that the prosecutor be given a reasonable opportunity to present the prosecution case. In my view, the Second Defendant deprived the prosecutor of such a reasonable opportunity in this case. To force the prosecutor to proceed on the first return date, in the circumstances of this case, gave rise to an injustice and denial of procedural fairness: Underhill v Murden (2007) 173 A Crim R 336 at 339 [11], 342 [25]. 
     
      
    57 The course adopted by the Second Defendant did not afford a hearing according to law to the prosecutor in accordance with s.202 Criminal Procedure Act 1986. In Director of Public Prosecutions v Wunderwald, error of law was found where the presiding Magistrate (the same Magistrate as in this case) part way through the prosecution case, in effect determined that no further witnesses would assist the prosecution case and the hearing was brought to a peremptory conclusion. In the course of granting relief, Sully J said at [21]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Having regard to the sequence of events as I have described it, it is, I think, relevant to observe at once, and with all proper respect to her Worship, that it was not for her Worship, in effect, to take over herself the conduct of the prosecution case, and, in effect, peremptorily to close off the calling by the prosecutor of any evidence that the prosecutor considered to be potentially relevant to the making out of the charge. Her Worship’s duty was to hear fairly, and to judge according to law, such evidence as either party to the proceedings before her Worship might wish to adduce.” 
        
       
      
    58 Criminal proceedings are conducted as adversarial litigation: Nudd v The Queen (2006) 80 ALJR 614 at 618-619 [9]. The role of the presiding Judge is to hold the balance between the contending parties without himself or herself taking part in their disputation. The Judge does not exercise an inquisitorial role in which he or she seeks to remedy the deficiencies in the case of either side, nor is part of the function of a Judge to don the mantle of prosecution or defence counsel: Whitehorn v The Queen (1983) 152 CLR 657 at 682. The fundamental task of a Judge is to ensure a fair trial: R v Meher [2004] NSWCCA 355 at [76]; Robinson v R (2006) 162 A Crim R 88 at [138]-[140]. Although these observations were made concerning the role of the Judge in a jury criminal trial, I consider that they are equally applicable to Magistrates hearing and determining criminal proceedings in the Local Court, whether defended hearings or sentence proceedings following a plea of guilty. 
     
      
    59 Finally, I accept that error of law has been demonstrated by the failure of the Second Defendant to give reasons as required by law for dismissing the charge. In Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Illawarra Cashmart Pty Limited, it was observed, at 408 [19], that one of the conventional functions of the requirement to give reasons relates to the appellate process. It is not satisfactory that an appeal court is left to undertake an analysis of exchanges between the Bench and counsel during submissions to ascertain a Magistrate’s reasons for determination.  
     
      
    60 It might be said that it is clear enough that the Second Defendant reached an immovable view that, despite the plea of guilty and the contents of the Statement of Facts and Mr Lade’s statement, there was no evidence of negligence revealed. If, however, her Honour had determined to dismiss the charge, the law required the expression of reasons. Although this error is not decisive, it constitutes the final step in a series of errors which I am satisfied occurred in this case. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    61 Clear errors of law have been demonstrated in this case. The matter ought be remitted to the Local Court. The appropriate course is to set aside the order of dismissal of the charge.  
     
      
    62 The First Defendant pleaded guilty to the charge in the Local Court. The appropriate course is for the proceedings to be remitted in that state. It will be a matter for the First Defendant to decide whether he wishes to make application for leave to withdraw his plea of guilty. In that event, it will be necessary for a Magistrate to determine, in accordance with the principles in Wong v Director of Public Prosecutions, whether leave to withdraw the plea of guilty ought be granted. 
     
      
    63 I propose to make orders under s.59(2)(a) Criminal (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. It is not necessary to address the alternative claim for prerogative and declaratory relief beyond observing that clear jurisdictional error has been demonstrated. Had there been an impediment to the grant of statutory appellate relief, I would have granted the Plaintiff prerogative and declaratory relief. 
     
      
    64 In circumstances where I am well satisfied that the Second Defendant peremptorily dismissed the charge, in the face of a plea of guilty, and without proper regard to applicable law and practice, it is appropriate that the matter be remitted to the Local Court to be determined by a Magistrate other than the Second Defendant: Director of Public Prosecutions v Lee [2006] NSWSC 270 at [68]; Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Neamati at [42]; Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Fabri [2008] NSWSC 655 at [14]-[15]. 
     
      
    65 I make the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (a) the appeal is allowed; 
       
       
      (b) I set aside the order of the Second Defendant made on 23 January 2008 dismissing the charge against the First Defendant under s.42(1)  
      Road Transport (Safety Transport and Management) Act 1999 
      ; 
       
       
      (c) the matter is remitted to the Local Court to be heard before a different Magistrate conformably with this judgment; 
       
       
      (d) the First Defendant is to pay the Plaintiff’s costs; 
       
       
      (e) the First Defendant is granted a certificate under s.6  
      Suitors’ Fund Act 1951 
      .

     JUDGMENT 
    1. The first defendant challenges the form and capacity of imputations 3(a)(i) and 6(a)(i) as pleaded in paragraphs 3 and 6 of the Statement of Claim and seeks orders for verification of particulars of publication. The claim for defamation is brought only against the first defendant and the second defendant did not participate in the argument. 2. The text of the two matters complained of is set out in my previous judgment (Lassanah v State of NSW [2009] NSWDC 73).3. The imputations pleaded in paragraph 3 are: 
     
     (a) (i) The first plaintiff is a thief. 
      
      
      OR 
      
      
     (a) (ii) The first plaintiff is an attempted thief. 
      
     (b) The first plaintiff intended to steal from the Tag Heuer Boutique Shop. 
      
     (c) (i) The second plaintiff is a thief. 
      
      
      OR 
      
      
     (c) (ii) The second plaintiff is an attempted thief. 
      
     (d) The second plaintiff intended to steal from the Tag Heuer Boutique Shop. 
    4. The imputations pleaded in paragraph 6 are:  
     
     (a) (i) The first plaintiff is a thief. 
      
      
      OR 
      
      
     (a) (ii) The first plaintiff is an attempted thief. 
      
     (b) The first plaintiff intended to steal from the Tag Heuer Boutique Shop. 
      
     (c) (i) The second plaintiff is a thief. 
      
      
      OR 
      
      
     (c) (ii) The second plaintiff is an attempted thief. 
      
     (d) The second plaintiff intended to steal from the Tag Heuer Boutique Shop. 
    5. Mr Caspersonn submitted that neither of the matters complained of state the plaintiffs are thieves, but only that they are being stopped before they attempt to steal.6. Courts must approach the task of striking out imputations with great caution. If reasonable minds may differ as to whether or not the matter complained of is capable of conveying a defamatory meaning, then the application should be refused: Favell v Queensland Newspapers Pty Ltd (2005) 221 ALR 186. 7. The first imputation is pleaded with the alternative, lesser imputation as a “fall-back”. The pleader has clearly heeded the warning of Hunt A-JA in Harvey v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCA 255 at [78]:  
     
     “ 
     [78] 
      If a plaintiff chooses to plead an imputation which is by no means assured of success without the alternative of a fall-back imputation, and if the jury does not accept it, there is much to be said — in compliance with Pt 1 r 3 — for the exercise of the discretion to refuse to allow the plaintiff to mend his hand at a second trial by pleading what should have been a fall-back imputation at the first trial and taking the chance that the defendant will not succeed in a plea of truth.” 
    8. Given the context and language of this oral publication, whether the words convey the imputation that each of the plaintiffs is a thief, or only an attempted thief, is a matter for the jury. The first defendant’s application to strike out imputations 3(a)(i) and 6(a)(i) is refused.9. The plaintiffs supplied particulars of publication in paragraphs 2 and 5. These were that the words were spoken by police officers to the plaintiffs within the hearing of each other and within the hearing of unnamed passers by who stopped to watch. The first defendant has sought further particulars but the plaintiffs are unable to name these persons. The first defendant seeks an order that these answers to particulars be verified.10. For reasons that I have set out in more detail in Moses v State of New South Wales (No. 2) [2009] NSWDC 99, in which the same counsel have appeared today, this application is rejected.11. The plaintiffs have been entirely successful in this application and a costs order will be made in the plaintiffs’ favour.Orders (1) Application by first defendant to strike out imputations 3(a)(i) and 6(a)(i) and for verified answers to particulars refused.(2) First defendant pay plaintiffs’ costs of the application.(3) Orders in accordance with the Short Minutes of Order filed in court.(4) Stood over for further directions to Friday 11 September 2009 at 9:00am.

     CATHRYN ANN BEATSON v REGINA 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 TOBIAS JA: On 13 February 2009 the appellant, Catherine Anne Beatson was convicted by a jury of the offence that on 16 June 2007 at Chippendale she did have in her possession for supply not less than the commercial quantity of 1,3 methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (commonly known as ecstasy). The appellant’s co-offender, Andrew Craig Byrne, was jointly tried with her and convicted of the same offence. The appellant now seeks to appeal against her conviction upon the following grounds, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        Ground One  
         - The verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground Two  
        – His Honour erred by failing to direct the jury to acquit the appellant. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground Three 
         – His Honour erred by refusing to admit evidence from Yasmin Savage that Andrew Byrne had previously asked her if she wanted some pills. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground Four 
         – His Honour erred by failing to order that the appellant be tried separately from Andrew Byrne. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground Five  
        – The trial miscarried because the Crown Prosecutor submitted to the jury that defence counsel had raised irrelevant issues to divert the jury from considering the true facts, that the appellant and Mr Byrne had knowledge of the drugs in the vehicle. 
        
       
      
    2 For reasons that will become apparent, it is only necessary to deal with Ground 1, namely, the verdict was unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence at trial. 
     
      
    3 The relevant test applicable to this ground is that articulated by McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ in MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606 at 623 [56] in the following terms (omitting footnotes): 
     
      
       
        
        “The majority in  
        M  
        pointed out that ‘[i]n most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced’. In such a case of doubt, it is only where the jury’s advantage of seeing and hearing the evidence can explain the difference in conclusion about the accused’s guilt that the appellate court may decide that no miscarriage of justice has occurred: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a  
          significant possibility  
          that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence.’ ” (Emphasis in original). 
          
         
        
       
       
      These principles have been repeated in numerous cases, one of the latest being that of this Court in  
      Rasic v Regina  
      [2009] NSWCCA 202 at [25] and [26].  
       
      
    4 As both the appellant and the Crown acknowledged, the key issue with respect to the charge against the appellant was whether the Crown could establish beyond reasonable doubt the element of possession. No complaint is made with respect to the relevant part of the summing up of the trial judge in which he correctly identified the obligation of the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that each of the accused intentionally had the relevant drugs in their physical custody or control to the exclusion of all others except themselves. 
     
      
    5 The case against the appellant was entirely circumstantial whereas that against her co-accused was only partly so. The relevant drugs were found in a vehicle which had been hired by the co-accused on 15 June 2007. The relevant facts are as follows. 
     
      
    6 On 16 June 2007 at approximately 6pm police officers attended Rose Street, Chippendale after a report that a blue Commodore had been in a collision. They found the appellant in the front passenger seat and her co-accused in the driver’s seat. Both appeared to be asleep.  
     
      
    7 A search of the vehicle both on that occasion and on the following day, 17 June, revealed a number of items including a packet of Horizon cigarettes within which was a small resealable bag containing 0.29gms of ecstasy; a large bag on the floor behind the driver’s seat containing 102.1gms of ecstasy and a large bag underneath the driver’s seat which contained 107.3gms of the drug. No fingerprints or DNA were found on the first of the bags, but the co-accused’s DNA was found on the second bag. Also found in the boot of the vehicle was three 4 litre cans of acetone which can be used as a cutting agent for amphetamines. Although a fingerprint was found on one of the cans it did not match either of the accused. Nonetheless, a black motorcycle jacket belonging to the co-accused was found in the boot. 
     
      
    8 In the rear footwell behind the front passenger seat was found a blue/black backpack containing paraphernalia capable of being used for drug use or supply. On the floor behind the front passenger seat, a green shopping bag contained similar paraphernalia was found. 
     
      
    9 At the time the police officers approached the appellant’s co-accused, he reached behind the front passenger seat and attempted to take something from the green shopping bag, which he was prevented from doing by a police officer. He was breath tested for alcohol and returned a negative result. However, a blood test was later conducted upon the co-accused in hospital which revealed ecstasy and a mixture of other drugs present in his blood. No such test was conducted with respect to the appellant. 
     
      
    10 It was common ground that the vehicle had been involved in a minor accident. At the time the police arrived both the co-accused and the appellant were apparently asleep. According to Leading Senior Constable Wynne (at T 108), the appellant was slumped over the dashboard and appeared to be asleep. The appellant was removed from the vehicle and taken across the road. At T177-178 LSC Wynne agreed that the highest he was able to say was that she was or appeared to be intoxicated or affected by something, but he was unable to identify that something. 
     
      
    11 As I have indicated, the appellant was not tested for drugs: nor was she breathalysed. 
     
      
    12 Relatively little evidence was led by the Crown in connection with the appellant. Most of the evidence of the Crown witnesses was directed to the co-accused as was their cross-examination. I have carefully read that part of the evidence relating to the appellant and what follows is the essential parts of that evidence. 
     
      
    13 The only evidentiary connection which could possibly be so described between the appellant and the drugs related to a sewing kit or white plastic container which held a large number of resealable plastic bags which, according to LSC Wynne, were used in the drug trade: see T114. 
     
      
    14 However, the evidence with respect to the so-called sewing kit was somewhat ambiguous. Evidence with respect to this issue was given both by Senior Constable Bushell and Constable Quinn. The evidence of the former (at T193-194) was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did you see the accused, Miss Beatson, walk back to the vehicle, sit in the front passenger seat and take some ID out of a wallet? 
         
        A. Yes, I did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. About that time did you see her drop the wallet and a plastic sewing kit into the gutter between her feet? 
         
        A. Yes, I did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you then see Miss Beatson get up and walk back over to where Constable Quinn was standing? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you then walk over to where the wallet and sewing kit were in the gutter, did you pick them up and put them on the front passenger seat of the vehicle? 
         
        A. Yes, I did.” 
        
       
      
    15 A slightly different version was given by Constable Quinn (at T229) in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did you ask Ms Beatson if she had any identification on her? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. She said it was in the vehicle? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was she taken back to the vehicle and did she sit in the front passenger side of the vehicle and did she start to get her identification out of her bag? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q As you watched her did you see her fiddle around for a whitle and did you notice that she knocked a clear white plastic container out of the vehicle as she was getting her identification? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you take the identification from her and then walk her back to the wall and did she then sit down? 
         
        A. Yes.” 
        
       
      
    16 It will be apparent from the foregoing extracts from the evidence that on one version, when extracting her ID from her wallet the appellant not only dropped her wallet but also a plastic sewing kit into the gutter between her feet whereas on the other version it was while she was fiddling around in an attempt to extract her ID from her wallet that she knocked a clear white plastic container out of the vehicle into the gutter.  
     
      
    17 How precisely the sewing kit/container came to be dropped or not, intentionally or otherwise, by the appellant was left up in the air. 
     
      
    18 The appellant was placed under arrest for being in possession of a prohibited drug. The following exchange took place between her and Constable Quinn relevant to this issue: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did Senior Constable Bushell come over to the caged truck and say, ‘Catherine, do you understand why you are under arrest?’ and did Ms Beatson reply ‘No’? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did Constable Bushell say ‘For the possession of a prohibited drug, you do not have to say or do anything if you do not want to, do you under stand that?’. 
         
        A. yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did Ms Beatson reply ‘Yeah, but I didn’t have any drugs on me’? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did Constable Bushell say ‘Anything you say or do I will record and I may use this recording in court, do you understand that?’ 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And did Ms Beatson reply ‘Yeah, but I didn’t have any drugs on me’? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
      
    19 The appellant’s foregoing response when cautioned was, to say the least, ambiguous. I accept that it was not a direct denial of any knowledge of the drugs in the vehicle, but being ambiguous it was hardly a firm foundation, whether taken alone or in conjunction with the other evidence, for a finding beyond reasonable doubt that she was intentionally in possession of 209gms of ecstasy for the purpose of supply. In any event, it could legitimately be said that the appellant’s reply to Constable Bushell was indeed responsive to his informing her that she was under arrest for “the possession of a prohibited drug”. In other words, the appellant could be forgiven for understanding that she was being charged with the possession of drugs on her person. This would explain her response. 
     
      
    20 In its written submissions the Crown accepted that the overwhelming weight of evidence inculpated the appellant’s co-accused rather than the appellant. It submitted that a scenario could not have rationally developed whereby the co-accused was acquitted and the appellant alone convicted. On the other hand in my view a scenario could have rationally developed whereby the co-accused was convicted and the appellant acquitted. There would have been nothing irrational about that. 
     
      
    21 The Crown also accepted that in the case against the co-accused there was direct evidence that physically connected him to the prohibited drugs. The exercise of comparing the respective cases of the two accused was capable of illustrating the relative strengths of those cases namely, and I interpolate this, that one was strong and the other was not. It was acknowledged that to an advocate, the relative strengths of the case against the appellant’s co-accused as distinct of that against the appellant herself provided a forensic means to persuade the jury to use the comparison as itself a reason why the Crown case against the appellant should be rejected as insufficient. I agree and such a case was made to the jury and ought, in my view, to have been sufficiently persuasive to at least have raised a reasonable doubt as to her guilt. 
     
      
    22 The Crown nevertheless submitted that the motor vehicle itself was a travelling store of prohibited drugs for sale. As both the appellant and her co-accused were discovered asleep in the vehicle, the clear available inference was that they were both intoxicated by drugs. This was certainly the case in relation to the co-accused – there was no direct evidence in support of that proposition in the case of the appellant, although it may have been an available inference. 
     
      
    23 The Crown also submitted that the appellant’s shared interest in drugs with her co-accused implied, at the very least, comity with him insofar as the illicit possession and purchase of prohibited drugs was concerned. Drawing the necessary inferences, the circumstances favoured the hypothesis that the appellant was acting jointly with her co-accused rather than simply being his passenger, or indeed his customer. They remained in company with each other after the consumption of drugs.  
     
      
    24 I do not accept this last submission as being the only hypothesis that was open to the jury to find. In my view a position to the contrary was an equally open hypothesis. At the very least, a hypothesis of equal strength was that the appellant was in the company of her co-accused simply because she was indeed his passenger and may have been his customer and he her supplier. The factors relied upon by the Crown could not, in my view, have led the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the only hypothesis open was that the appellant was in possession of the drugs in the relevant legal sense.  
     
      
    25 As I have observed above, the Crown recognised that the essential issue for the jury’s determination was whether the appellant could properly be found beyond reasonable doubt to have intentionally exercised physical custody and control, in a joint sense, over the prohibited substance found in the vehicle. It was submitted that it was open to the jury to draw inferences from the circumstances in which the appellant and her co-accused were located in the vehicle and the nature of their discovery and apparent association at that time to find that she was in a position whereby she could exercise dominion over the items in the car to the exclusion of anyone except herself and her co-accused.  
     
      
    26 It was submitted that it was open to the jury to reason from the evidence that the appellant’s direct proximity to the paraphernalia contained in the car (including that in the boot of the car) when considered in combination with the other items found therein, operated to support the proposition of joint possession of the drugs which were destined to be repackaged and supplied.  
     
      
    27 In my view the Crown’s contentions should be rejected. The circumstances proved by the Crown did not establish beyond reasonable doubt that the only rational inference to be drawn from the evidence by the jury was that the appellant was, to her knowledge, in possession of the drugs in that she intentionally exercised custody or control over them to the exclusion of all others except herself and her co-accused for the purpose of their supply. 
     
      
    28 As I have said, an equally rational inference to that contended for by the Crown was that the appellant was no more than a user of drugs and that she had used some of the drug on this occasion: in other words, although she may have used the drug with the concurrence of her co-accused, her relationship to the drugs was no more than a recipient of them from her co-accused as her supplier. At least that was a hypothesis equally open to the jury and thus one consistent with her innocence of the offence with which she was charged. 
     
      
    29 The difficulty faced by the Crown is that there was no evidence as to first, how or when or for how long the appellant came to be in the subject vehicle or as to the nature of her relationship, such as it might be, with her co-accused; second, whether she was party to the placing of the drugs and the other paraphernalia in the vehicle; third, whether she was involved in their purchase or acquisition; fourth, whether she knew that the drugs and other paraphernalia were even in the vehicle; and fifth, whether she in fact was intoxicated as a consequence of using drugs prior to her arrest. 
     
      
    30 In contrast, as the appellant submitted, the evidence with respect to the appellant’s co-accused was that first, he had arranged for the hire of the vehicle; second, that he was slumped forward over the steering wheel in the driver’s seat; third, that he tested positive for drugs in a blood test; fourth, that he attempted to reach for the green shopping bag which contained drug type paraphernalia; fifth, that he was in close proximity to the Horizon cigarette packet that contained drugs; sixth, that the black leather jacket belonging to him was found in the boot in which there was also three 4 litre cans of acetone; seventh, and most importantly, the co-accused’s DNA was found on the second bag of drugs found on 17 June. 
     
      
    31 Furthermore, there was no evidence that the appellant had ever had anything to do with the green shopping bag; that she had anything to do with the blue and black backpack which contained prescriptions issued by a Dr Sheridan in the name of the co-accused as well as motorcycle gloves which could be clearly linked to his motorcycle jacket found in the boot of the vehicle which contained the three 4 litre cans of acetone. In fact the only evidence of any real probative value which may have linked the appellant to the contents of the vehicle was the sewing kit, but there was nothing to suggest that the appellant had anything to do with this item which fell into the gutter outside the vehicle as the appellant attempted to obtain her ID card from her wallet. 
     
      
    32 At the end of the day the only connection between the appellant and the vehicle was the fact that she was in the front passenger seat at the time that the police arrived on the scene. She was unconnected with the hiring and driving of the vehicle by her co-accused and, as I have indicated, there is nothing to establish when, for what purpose and for how long she had been in the vehicle. 
     
      
    33 It is thus apparent that the Crown’s case was based on no more than the contents of the vehicle and the fact that the appellant was found in it with the ambiguous evidence of the sewing kit. In my view the evidence led against the appellant not only displayed inadequacies but also lacked probative force and gave rise to a significant possibility that an innocent person had been convicted. Critically, in my view, a jury could not have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the only rational inference from the evidence was that the appellant was in possession of the drugs found in the vehicle for the purpose of supply in that she intentionally exercised custody or control over them to the exclusion of all others except her co-accused. I would experience such a doubt and, therefore, so ought have the jury. 
     
      
    34 I repeat that in my view, an equally rational inference open on the evidence was that the appellant was an innocent passenger in the vehicle. Even if her intoxication had been due to the ingestion of drugs, there was no evidence that would necessarily support an inference that it was the drugs in the vehicle she had ingested. But even if that was an available inference, it did not follow that a jury could find beyond reasonable doubt that she was in possession of the totality of the drugs the subject of the charge for the purpose of supply. 
     
      
    35 For the foregoing reasons in my opinion Ground 1 has been established with the consequence that it is unnecessary to consider the other grounds of appeal relied upon. The appeal should be allowed, the appellant’s conviction should be quashed and a verdict of acquittal entered. 
     
      
    36 HIDDEN J: I agree with Tobias JA.

    2 HOEBEN J: I agree. 
     
      
    3 PRICE J: The applicant Bernard Patrick Allan seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him by McGuire ADCJ on 1 May 2009 in the District Court. Before venturing into the grounds of the appeal, it is useful to recount the unusual history of these proceedings in that court.  
     
      
    4 The applicant had on 1 April 2009 pleaded not guilty before a jury panel to a single count on an indictment which was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “[He] on 5 April 2007 at Tamworth in the State of New South Wales did break and enter the dwelling house at 1 Coorong Street, and therein did steal a laptop computer and a ladies wallet and contents.” 
        
       
      
    5 This was an offence contrary to s 112(1) Crimes Act 1900, which was noted on the indictment. 
     
      
    6 Section 112(1) Crimes Act provides for the offence of break, enter and commit a serious indictable offence. The maximum penalty for an offence contrary to s 112(1) is 14 years imprisonment. No standard non-parole period applies. 
     
      
    7 Section 112(2) Crimes Act provides for a more serious offence where a person commits an offence under s 112(1) in circumstances of aggravation. The “circumstances of aggravation” which are found in s 105A(1) Crimes Act, relevantly, include: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “… 
         
        (f) the alleged offender knows that there is a person, or that there are persons, in the place where the offence is alleged to be committed.” 
        
       
      
    8 The maximum penalty for an offence contrary to s 112(2) Crimes Act is 20 years imprisonment. A standard non-parole period of 5 years has been prescribed for this offence. 
     
      
    9 After a jury of twelve was empanelled, the Crown, in his opening address said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Then we come to a more important or an essential element that goes to state of mind of the accused, that is knowing that there was a person or persons inside. Now, we have to prove that the accused knew that beyond a reasonable doubt. You’ll probably hear from his Honour about that. Let me just tell you now there’s some law in relation to assumptions.” 
        
       
      
    10 It is evident that the Crown had in mind that the applicant was charged with an aggravated break and enter contrary to s 112(2) as the “essential element” to which he referred was the circumstance of aggravation of knowledge of the presence of a person or persons in the dwelling house: s 105A(1)(f) Crimes Act. Unfortunately no-one drew the Crown’s attention to this misunderstanding during the three day trial.  
     
      
    11 The Crown’s misunderstanding was continued in his closing address when he said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Then there is the aspect of knowing there was a person or persons inside, and in respect to that, I might have briefly mentioned in my opening that there is a presumption that someone who enters in these circumstances knows that there is someone inside, and you will hear more about that in the directions of law from his Honour, and I don’t want to tell you about that.” 
        
       
      
    12 It appears that the Judge also understood that the charge to which the applicant had pleaded not guilty was an offence of aggravated break and enter contrary to s 112(2). His Honour had asked during the trial in the absence of the jury (T 74 AB 164): 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Mr Crown, the indictment charges the accused, with knowing that there was a person or persons inside, did break and enter the dwelling house. What evidence is there of that? “ 
        
       
      
    13 An exchange then followed between the Judge and the Crown concerning the statutory presumption of knowledge found in s 105A(2A) Crimes Act. 
     
      
    14 During his summing up, the Judge directed the jury that the Crown was required to establish that the applicant knew that there was a person or persons inside the premises and further directed them in terms of the statutory presumption.  
     
      
    15 The applicant had originally been indicted in the District Court with the more serious charge under s 112(2) Crimes Act and that indictment had remained on the court file. It seems that the Judge, because of the Crown opening, misapprehended that the trial was proceeding on the original indictment. Regrettably, nothing was said by the applicant’s counsel to the Judge or to the Crown that the charge to which the applicant had pleaded was the less serious charge under s 112(1).  
     
      
    16 This appeal emphasises, notwithstanding the heavy caseload for those involved in the criminal trial work of the District Court, the need to pay careful attention to the terms of the indictment upon which an offender stands for trial.  
     
      
    17 The jury returned a verdict of guilty which the Judge understood was a finding of guilt to a charge of aggravated break and enter. In his remarks on sentence, the Judge said (ROS at 1): 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender comes before me for sentence, he having been found guilty by a jury on a charge of break, enter and steal knowing that there were persons inside the premises. That crime attracts a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment. Attached to it [is] a standard non-parole of five years.” 
        
       
      
    18 The Judge sentenced the applicant to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months commencing 3 April 2009 and expiring on 2 October 2011. A parole period of 1 year 6 months was fixed. The total term of the sentence is 4 years.  
     
      
    19 The notice of appeal identifies two grounds: 
     
      
      Ground 1: His Honour erred in having regard to a higher maximum penalty.  
       
      Ground 2: His Honour erred in having regard to a standard non-parole period that did not apply.  
       
      
    20 The Crown properly concedes the two grounds of appeal as the applicant was sentenced for an offence more serious than the offence on the indictment. The Crown, however, submits the sentence is not manifestly excessive and no lesser sentence is warranted in law: s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The Crown cited R v Harris [2007] NSWCCA 130 in which this Court emphasised that heavy sentences should generally be imposed for break, enter and steal offences committed by repeat offenders on domestic premises, whether or not they were aggravated forms of the offence. The Crown also brought to our attention the helpful review by RA Hulme J of sentences imposed for single counts of break, enter and steal against s 112(1) Crimes Act in Morrison v R [2009] NSWCCA 211 at [53]-[62]. The Crown submitted that when consideration was given to all of the cases referred to in Morrison (many of which were pleas of guilty) it could not be said that the sentence was manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    21 The applicant submits on the other hand that a less severe sentence is warranted in law and statistical material from the Judicial Commission was provided.  
     
      
    22 Although error has been demonstrated, the question for this Court is whether some other sentence is warranted in law: Baxter v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 237. Facts 
     
      
    23 The facts of the offence, shortly stated, are that the applicant on 5 April 2007 entered the dwelling house by opening a closed door and stole a laptop computer and a wallet containing some forty-five dollars. The owner of the property, T, had left for work at about 6am locking the front and back doors. The householder heard the applicant in the house and telephoned T at about 6:10am. T called H, his employee, who he knew would be on his way to work and enquired whether he had seen anyone with a laptop. H called back, informing T that he had found the computer at a certain address. When T arrived the applicant was present. H told T “this bloke had your computer.” The applicant denied that he had stolen it claiming that he had found it in a park. He had, shortly before, tried to sell the computer making a similar claim of finding it. 
     
      
    24 As the Judge was under the misapprehension that a standard non-parole period of 5 years applied, he characterised the offence as being less serious than a mid range offence and as being “at the lower end of the scale”: ROS at 4. The Judge found that the offence was not planned, the applicant’s entry into the house was brief, he neither sought to approach any of the occupants nor had he entered a bedroom nor caused destruction. There was no evidence, his Honour said, to demonstrate any ongoing effect upon the victims. Subjective circumstances 
     
      
    25 In his sentencing remarks the Judge summarised the applicant’s subjective circumstances as follows (ROS at 2): 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender is aged thirty-six and is Aboriginal. He tells me that he was born in Moree, his father died when he was a baby and he grew up on a mission. Having moved to Sydney when nine or ten he was in and out of boys’ homes and a street kid. He has had very little schooling, albeit that he can read and write. His mother had problems with alcohol. Having spent a couple of years at school after moving to Queensland he obtained labouring work and has worked as a roof tiler. However his last employment was in approximately 1996 or 1997. He told me of injuries which he had sustained in two motor vehicle accidents which involved head injuries, a leg fracture and facial scarring. It is his claim that he needs knee surgery or attention to his knees.  
        
       
       
        
        At the age of about eighteen or nineteen he began to drink heavily, he resorted to heroin and amphetamines. He is subject to a condition of epilepsy and is on continuing medication. The father of five children he apparently has little if any connection with his two sons, however he has a boy aged eight and two girls whom he saw on a daily basis, until he was taken into custody. At one stage he attended a residential rehabilitation program and has expressed his desire to attend a further such program with a view to effecting complete rehabilitation. He has been on methadone for the last two years or thereabouts. Whilst in gaol he has done various courses including a welding course and claims to have various skills.” 
        
       
      
    26 The Judge found special circumstances to facilitate the applicant’s rehabilitation. 
     
      
    27 The applicant’s criminal history discloses a lengthy prior record of offences of dishonesty including convictions for robbery in company, larceny, steal from the person and break, enter and steal. As an adult, he has had five prior convictions for break, enter and steal, the last conviction being at Penrith Local Court on 11 February 2005 when he was sentenced to imprisonment for 16 months with a 12 month non-parole period. The applicant’s repeat offending not only disentitles him to leniency but gives rise to considerations of retribution, deterrence and protection of society: R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242. 
     
      
    28 The Judge remarked that the applicant’s very extensive criminal history was a “matter of concern” and noted that on the applicant’s account, he had spent some 14 of the last 18 or 19 years in custody. His Honour remarked that the crime of break, enter and steal was “seemingly endemic” and gave weight to the need for general deterrence. 
     
      
    Intervention? 
     
      
    29 The Judge’s assessment of the offence being at “the lower end of the scale” for the reasons identified at [24] above applies to the s 112(1) offence. None of the factors identified in the guideline judgment in R v Ponfield [1999] NSWCCA 435 as enhancing the seriousness of a s 112(1) offence are present in the offence committed by the applicant.  
     
      
    30 Notwithstanding the applicant’s prior history of repeat offending, I have concluded that some other sentence is warranted in law. 31 I have taken into account the contents of the applicant’s affidavit sworn 10 September 2010 upon re-sentence. It appears that he is making some progress in dealing with his drug addiction but remains on methadone. I propose that the total term of the sentence be reduced to 3 years 3 months. The finding of special circumstances by the Judge was well founded and is to be maintained in the proposed sentence. A non-parole period of 2 years adequately reflects the criminality involved in the offence.  
     
      
    32 Accordingly I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Grant leave to appeal 
       
      2. Allow the appeal.  
       
      3. The sentence imposed in the District Court on 1 May 2009 be quashed.  
       
      4. The applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 3 April 2009 and expiring on 2 April 2011. I set a balance of term of 1 year 3 months which is to commence on 3 April 2011 and is to expire on 2 July 2012.

2756923,R v French [2011] NSWDC 68,"Judgment 



1HIS HONOUR: Jonathan French was picked up by police with a substantial quantity of drugs in his possession on 12 March 2010. Mr French gave evidence as to the circumstances which led to him being in possession of those drugs. He had two friends, one of whom wanted to sell drugs and another of whom wanted to buy drugs. Mr French did not want to be involved but the purchaser insisted that he become involved because he did not trust anyone he did not know. At first Mr French said that he would not become involved. Eventually he reluctantly did so. 

2He went to Chatswood where he was given a bag of drugs containing about 785 tablets. He thought they were ecstasy but in fact they contained a broadly similar drug, 1-benzyl piperazine. He took possession of the drugs and went to meet the purchaser. As he and the purchaser were walking to where the money was, police, who were conducting patrols in the area, noticed them. The two men appeared to be acting suspiciously, one of them, the friend, was also known to be involved in drug supply activities. Accordingly, the police approached the two men then Mr French, the offender, made a very slight effort to get away before giving up; the friend made a more substantial effort but he was ultimately arrested as well. 

3Police then searched the offender and discovered the bag that I have mentioned. He told police that he had been asked to sell the drugs for $12 or $12.50 each. He was arrested and taken to the police station and remained in custody for 109 days until he was granted bail by the Supreme Court. 

4There is no suggestion that Mr French was involved in any other form of drug supply activity at any other time in his life. He gave evidence that he was a drug user, and I will return to that evidence later, but I need to emphasise that the evidence suggests that this was an isolated occasion on which the offender reluctantly became involved as an intermediary and courier in a significant drug supply transaction. 

5Of course this raises the issue as to whether the offender was trafficking to a substantial degree. For many years the law has been that those who traffic in drugs to a substantial degree should expect to receive a fulltime custodial sentence unless there are exceptional circumstances. Of course that principle was first stated at a time when some forms of alternative to fulltime custody which now exist were not available, I have in mind the recently introduced Intensive Corrections Order option. Another thing I want to say about the principle, to be found in Clarke v R [2009] NSWCCA 49, is this. The law, for obvious reasons, likes bright lines, but, in truth, sentencing is a very discretionary activity. I am encouraged by the authorities to decide whether the offender was trafficking to a substantial degree and, if so, whether there are exceptional circumstances justifying the imposition of a sentence of other than full-time custody. Expressed that way there is the temptation to think that what is involved are two separate decisions. But in truth, the ultimate decision as to the form of sentence which should be imposed upon an offender involves a discretionary consideration involving both questions. 

6With that qualification I am able to find that the offender was not trafficking to a substantial degree. It is not the law that, simply because this was an isolated act of supply, the offender cannot be said to have been trafficking in a substantial degree and, indeed, the quantity involved - a commercial quantity of the relevant drug - would tend to suggest a substantial trafficking. But in this case, taking into account the offender's role and the reluctance with which he performed that role, I am able to find that he was not trafficking to a substantial degree. This means that I do not need to find that there are exceptional circumstances justifying a sentence of other than full-time custody. But I can say that even if I am wrong and the offender was trafficking to a substantial degree, such exceptional circumstances exist, as I will shortly demonstrate. 

7Of course this matter is a very serious one. The supply of a commercial quantity of drugs carries a maximum penalty of twenty years and a standard non-parole period of ten years. In this case the standard non-parole period is not of direct application because of the plea of guilty but it remains as a guidepost to the sentence I should impose. 

8Objectively, the matter involves an offence which is significantly below the middle of the range of objective seriousness. The quantity involved was just over the 250 gram cut off which takes the matter into the commercial quantity area and the role played by the offender, reluctantly as I have emphasised, both suggest the finding that I have made, that is that objectively the offence is significantly below the middle of the range of offences of this type. 

9The offender is a relatively young man. Another bright line in the law involves what happens after an offender turns eighteen. Once that happens the offender is to be treated, in broad terms, as an adult, but that does not mean that he has the maturity that later develops. The offender was in his very early twenties when he committed this offence. He had been brought up by loving and law abiding parents. He reported he had a happy childhood. He has three siblings, none of whom have been in breach of the law. He has a girlfriend with whom he has been in a committed relationship for a number of years. It is most unusual therefore to see a person with that background before the courts for offences such as this. It appears, however, that the genesis for this offence arose out of the offender's involvement in drugs and his friendship with people who were drug suppliers and drug purchasers. 

10As the offender was growing up his parents noticed behaviour which was of concern to them. The offender was thus diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. He has also been diagnosed as suffering from bipolar disorder and at times, substance abuse disorder. That combination of factors has led to the offender being much less able than someone who does not suffer from those conditions to reason rationally about the consequences of his actions. 

11In the lead up to this offence the offender, who is a keen and talented musician, was working on a particular recording project. He was anxious to see it completed as efficiently as possible. He was sleeping much less than he ordinarily would. He was using his ADHD medication, Dexamphetamine, to excess to assist him to stay awake and using a substantial quantity of recreational drugs at the same time. In those circumstances, the psychiatrist, who has been treating the offender, Dr Nicholas Cassimatis, formed the conclusion that: 


"" it would appear that he was in a hypermanic episode with grandiose ideas, need for less sleep, distractible, tangential in his thinking, gullible and adventurous. His judgment would have been impulsive and poor. The abuse of medication and other drugs would have made his decision making and behaviour more obvious, incompetent and risky. In my view that at the time he would have been experiencing a hypermanic episode bipolar disorder where his judgment was impaired, his behaviour was disinhibited and reckless "". 



12It is to be noted that that report was tendered by Ms Coultas-Roberts for the offender and the Crown did not require Dr Cassimatis for cross-examination. In those circumstances I will accept what the doctor says which is a significant matter in assessing the moral culpability of the offender. I repeat, his judgment would have been impulsive and poor and his behaviour was disinhibited and reckless at the time. 

13The way in which mental illness affects a sentence on an offender are well known. Of course the mental illness may affect the offender's moral culpability where it contributed to the commission of the offence. As I hope I have explained, I find that to be the case in the present matter. Secondly, the mental illness may render the offender an inappropriate person on whom a sentence reflecting a large component of general deterrence should be imposed. Of course personal deterrence remains important. Thirdly, a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on a mentally ill person. Each of the factors identified by Sperling J in R v Hemsley  [2004] NSWCCA 228 is applicable in the present case. 

14I mentioned before that the offender spent time in custody before being released on bail. Not only did the offender spend about three and a half months at Silverwater prison, where he was exposed as a young vulnerable man to prison life with all its terrors and fears, but upon release from custody the offender was subject to bail conditions which were reasonably stringent. In particular he had to report daily to the police and was subject to a curfew from 7pm to 7am. That curfew has recently been eased on Thursday nights because the offender has been able to obtain some work performing as a musician at a city hotel. But for many months he had to be home every night from 7 o'clock in the evening to 7 o'clock in the morning. Police did their job appropriately and checked every now and then that he was obeying the curfew and found that he was. So in assessing the sentence to be imposed upon the offender, I am able to take into account that he has already spent some time in custody giving him what used to be described as a ""short, sharp shock"" and has been subject to some form of quasi custody because of the daily reporting and more importantly, the curfew conditions to which he was subjected. 

15The offender has displayed his remorse for what he has done in Court, to his psychiatrist and to his family. I accept that he is remorseful. I accept that he has put behind him his use of illicit drugs. Whether that will remain the case is difficult to determine, after all being at home with his parents every night has not given him much opportunity to use illicit drugs and when he is ultimately able to go out at night, he will find temptations - especially working in the music industry - which he must resist. But he, I am satisfied, desires not to use illegal drugs in the future. 

16The offender does have a criminal history and, in fact, he was on a bond for an offence of obtaining benefit by deception at the time of this offence. He explained the circumstances in which he committed that offence which flowed from other offending involving him driving without a licence. The offender's mother suggested that the offender had learnt a particular lesson through being arrested in this case. He was starting to commit offences fairly regularly without much thought of the consequences. Perhaps those offences are also related to the mental disorders from which he suffers. But now that he has seen for himself in a very concrete way what happens to those who commit criminal offences of a serious kind, I would expect that the offender will be personally deterred from committing further offences of a serious kind in the future. 

17Ms Coultas-Roberts' submission ultimately is that whilst this matter clearly requires a custodial sentence, it should be one where I refer the offender for assessment for an Intensive Corrections Order. The Crown challenges that on two bases; firstly the principle that requires a full-time custodial sentence in this matter, whether that is because the trafficking was to a substantial degree or because, even if it was not, there are no exceptional circumstances. I have already dealt with that issue. And the Crown also says that in any case I could not impose a custodial sentence of less than two years, which would make the offender ineligible for any alternative to full-time custody. However, in this case I am satisfied that a sentence of no more than two years is appropriate. This would not be the case were it not for the offender having already served some time in custody and then a lengthy period on bail during which his movement and liberty was restricted. But I am able to take those matters into account and determine that any remaining period of custody for which the offender is required is likely to be no more than two years. 

18An ICO would provide considerable benefit to the offender's rehabilitation. It would also punish him in a significant way. True, this would not be as much as sending him back to full-time custody, but an ICO is far from a 'walk in the park'. An ICO has one significant advantage over full-time custody as far as the offender and the community are concerned. It does much more than a custodial sentence to promote the offender's rehabilitation. That is not only of benefit to the offender but of benefit to the community as a whole. If the offender can be rehabilitated so that he does not commit further offences in the future, then the offender benefits of course, but so does the community. 

19For those reasons the order I make is this: The offender is convicted. I am satisfied that no form of sentence other than imprisonment is appropriate and that the sentence will be no more than two years. The offender is therefore referred for assessment as to his suitability for an Intensive Correction Order as a means of serving the sentence. His bail is continued for that purpose and I will list the matter on a date suitable to the parties for review of the ICO assessment report.

		25 July 2011",2011-05-04 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2758306,GOVINDARAJU v REGINA [2011] NSWCCA 255,"Judgment 

1BATHURST CJ : I agree with the orders proposed by Hall J and with his Honour's reasons. 

2HALL J : The applicant, Balamurugan Govindaraju, by notice dated 6 April 2011, seeks leave to appeal in respect of a sentence imposed upon him in the District Court on 16 July 2010. 

3The applicant was charged with an offence of importing a substance, being a border control drug, namely, heroin, the quantity of which was said to be a marketable quantity, contrary to the provisions of s.307.2(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) ( ""the Code"" ). 

4The maximum penalty for such an offence is 25 years' imprisonment and/or a fine of $555,000: see s.307.2(1). 

5The applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 9 years commencing 12 April 2009 and expiring on 11 April 2018. The sentencing judge imposed a non-parole period of 5 years, 4 months and 24 days. Accordingly, the earliest date upon which the applicant will be eligible for release on parole will be 4 September 2014. 

6The following two grounds of appeal were relied upon:- 

""1. The sentencing judge erred in finding an aggravating factor was that the applicant's role was greater than that of a courier. 

2. The sentencing judge erred in using the statement of assistance as evidence of the objective gravity of the offence."" 

7At the hearing, leave was granted for the applicant to rely upon a third ground. On 6 July 2011, the applicant filed a Supplementary Grounds of Appeal in which the following addition ground was set out:- 

""3. Her Honour erred in failing to allow procedural fairness to the applicant by her finding, as an aggravating factor, that the applicant's role was above that of a courier without providing the applicant the opportunity to make submissions to the contrary."" 

Background 

8The applicant was born on 3 June 1978. He was, accordingly, 30 years of age as at the date of the offence, namely, 12 April 2009. 

9The applicant advised that he was married with no children. His wife or former wife is presently said to reside in Indonesia. The evidence in this Court established that she has separated from the marriage. 

10In Malaysia, the applicant worked in various factories as a factory hand and, on two occasions, he went to Singapore in search for better paid work. It appears that he was there employed as a truck driver as at the date of the offence. 

11He had not previously visited Australia and had no family or other contacts when he arrived in this country. 

12He is not adversely recorded against any criminal law enforcement indices in Australia. However, evidence was produced at the sentencing hearing which indicated that he has a limited record of criminal offences in Malaysia and Singapore. I will refer to his criminal history later in this judgment. 

Circumstances of the offence 

13At the sentencing hearing, the Crown tendered a statement of facts which established the following matters. 

14The applicant arrived at Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport at about 6.55 pm on Sunday 12 April 2009 aboard a Malaysian Airlines flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. He was travelling on a Malaysian passport with a visitor's visa which was valid in Australia for three months. 

15On arrival, he was questioned by Customs Officers. He advised that he had travelled to Australia from Malaysia after a two week stay in India where surgery had been performed on his shoulder. He indicated that the purpose of his trip to Australia was for a short seven day holiday. 

16He subsequently told Customs Officers that, whilst in India, he had been given gold to swallow and smuggle into Australia. 

17He consented to undergo an internal search and, in due course and following admission to St George Hospital, Kogarah, he passed a total of 75 foreign objects (pellets). 

18On 15 April 2009, he was charged. On 16 April 2009, investigations determined that the 75 pellets contained compressed off-white powder, the gross weight of which was 594.9 grams. These were analysed and were confirmed as being heroin. The purity of the heroin was 62.6%. The total pure weight of heroin imported by the applicant was calculated to be 372.4 grams. The ""street value"" of 594.9 grams of heroin was estimated at between $148,725 and $267,705. 

19The applicant did not give evidence at the sentence hearing. Accordingly, t he details of the applicant's background are based upon the history as recorded in a psychological report by Dr Katie Seidler, clinical and forensic psychologist dated 11 September 2009. The report was tendered at the sentencing hearing and became Exhibit 1. 

20Dr Seidler noted that the applicant appeared to be ""somewhat unsophisticated, both socially and intellectually"" . She obtained a history of the applicant's father dying in about 2003. His mother was living in Malaysia and had health problems. His eldest brother was said to have died in 2007 in a motor vehicle accident. The loss of his brother was said to have had an impact upon him. 

21He attended school in Malaysia and competed primary school. He ceased mid-way through his second year of high school (Year 8) in order to pursue employment and begin contributing financially to the family. 

22The report set out the history of various employments in factories from the age of 15 in Malaysia including a period in a restaurant conducted by his aunt. He travelled to Singapore to obtain work at a factory, but eight or nine months later he returned to Malaysia where he resumed work as a factory hand in a plastics factory. 

23At some unknown time, he returned to Singapore again in the search for work but was unsuccessful and again moved back to Malaysia. He again commenced work at a factory where he was involved in stock keeping duties and truck driving. 

24In February 2009, he injured his left shoulder in a motor cycle accident. It seems it was not long after this incident that he travelled to Australia. 

25In 2008, he married an Indonesian woman. She was apparently required to return to Indonesia for visa reasons in June 2008, several months after they were married. He maintained contact with his wife, although with some difficulties. As indicated above, they have since separated. 

26The applicant admitted to some use of alcohol and on three occasions experimenting with cannabis. 

27In paragraph 33 of Dr Seidler's report, there is a history concerning events that were said to have led to the applicant's involvement in the subject offence. According to that history, he was contacted by an acquaintance of an uncle who allegedly offered him a sum of money to transport drugs into Australia. 

28It was then recorded that the applicant described a fairly protracted process whereby he was met by a number of Indian and African men. He then travelled to India and was put up in a hotel, which was said to have been funded by these men. According to the applicant, he remained in their company for approximately three weeks, during which time his visa and air ticket were obtained, and other travel arrangements were made on his behalf. The history records that it was during this period that he was instructed to swallow the drugs he was to transport to Australia. The applicant said that he had considerable difficulty with this, but was informed that he would be left stranded in India and forced to make his way back to Malaysia if he was unable to swallow the pellets. 

29According to the history in the report (paragraph 34), the applicant indicated that his decision to import drugs to Australia was based on his need to finance a cardiac operation for his mother. The surgery, in this respect, was said to be crucial and that neither he nor his mother could afford to finance it independently. 

Remarks on Sentence 

30The sentencing hearing took place on 2 July 2010. The matter was adjourned until 16 July 2010 on which date the sentencing judge delivered her remarks on sentence. 

31In relation to the applicant's role in the importation, the sentencing judge determined that it was greater than that of a mere courier. In that respect, her Honour stated (ROS, p.7):- 

""I find that the role played by him was that of an importer of a large quantity of high grade heroin. The potential street value of that drug was significant - between $148,000 and $267,000. Considerable planning had gone into the intended importation. He had met with those higher up in the hierarchy in Malaysia. He travelled with them to India and remained in their company for three weeks. He ingested the drugs. He returned to Malaysia and then flew on to Sydney, with a view to providing the pellets to an unnamed person in Sydney. In addition to his travel costs, he was to be paid for his role. I find he played an essential role in the importation of this quantity of heroin. He was involved at a greater level than a mere courier, demonstrated by his involvement with the identified men over a three-week period of time, during which time he had left his home country in order to participate in this crime. That, to my mind, aggravates the offence over and above a mere courier from one's homeland to a foreign country. "" (emphasis added) 

32Her Honour went on to state that assistance provided to the Australian Federal Police ""... discloses a greater knowledge of the whole syndicate than what a mere courier could be expected to know, although his assistance was of no benefit"" (ROS, p.7). 

Grounds of appeal 

33Grounds 1 and 3 overlap and, accordingly, will be considered together. 

Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in finding an aggravating factor was that the applicant's role was greater than that of a courier 

Ground 3: Her Honour erred in failing to allow procedural fairness to the applicant by her finding, as an aggravating factor, that the applicant's role was above that of a courier without providing the applicant the opportunity to make submissions to the contrary 

34Ms R Mathur of counsel, who appeared in this Court on behalf of the applicant, observed that the Agreed Statement of Facts tendered by the Crown did not expressly stipulate the role played by the applicant other than to say that he imported into Australia 372.4 grams of pure heroin. 

35It was acknowledged in those submissions that the role played by an offender in effecting the importation of drugs is an important factor in determining the seriousness of the offence and the appropriate sentence. 

36In relation to the sentencing judge's finding that the applicant's role was more than that of a mere courier, it was contended that there was insufficient evidence to establish that that was the fact beyond reasonable doubt. Reference was made in the submissions for the applicant to the High Court's judgment in Olbrich v R (1999) 199 CLR 270 at [27] and [28]. 

37It was submitted (Written submissions at [12]):- 

""... There was limited evidence with respect to the applicant's ' involvement ' with the three men whilst in India. The only evidence before the court was that it was during this time that his visa, ticket and travel arrangements were made. The sealed envelope containing [person's named inserted] statement takes the matter no further. It was further observed that the reference in Dr Seidler's report to the applicant's account that he was told that if he did not ingest the pellets, he would be left stranded in India and forced to make his own way back to Malaysia does not bespeak of a man whose role could be described as greater than that of a courier."" 

38In summary, the submission for the applicant was that there was no evidence to support a finding that there were additional acts performed by the applicant to place him above a courier in the hierarchy of the drug importation venture. On that basis, it was contended that the sentencing judge erred in imposing a sentence that was not warranted in law. 

39Counsel for the applicant relied upon statistics for offenders who pleaded guilty to an offence under s.307.2(1) of the Code involving the importation of heroin. It was said that these figures, inter alia, indicated that 95% received a sentence of less than 9 years. Of those, 97% received a non-parole period of 5 years or less. Accordingly, it was said that the statistics placed the applicant's sentence in the top 5% for offences under the above section. 

40The contention was that, having regard to the actual acts known to have been performed by the applicant, neither the role played by him nor the quantity of drug involved, warranted a sentence which placed his term of imprisonment in the top 5% of all offenders dealt with under the section of the Code. 

41In response, the Crown observed, firstly, that the role played by the applicant is a matter of importance in assessing the objective criminality of his offence and, secondly, that he had the onus of proving, on the balance of probabilities, that he was a ""mere courier"" so that such a finding mitigated his culpability in the importation of the drug. The Crown added that characterising the role of an offender by reference to a descriptive tag or label (eg couriers and principals) must not obscure, or be a substitute for, an assessment of what the offender did: Olbrich (supra) at 278. 

42The Crown also observed that the applicant did not give evidence, as was his entitlement. However, that left the judge with a ""paucity of evidence"" in relation to the extent of his involvement in the criminal enterprise in question. 

43The Crown acknowledged that the Statement of Facts did not indicate the role played by the applicant in the importation beyond referring to the quantities and nature of the drug and the internal concealment of the pellets. However, it submitted that the details of the circumstances in which the applicant came to commit the offence were set out in paragraph 33 of Dr Seidler's report. The report had not been admitted into evidence on any limited basis. 

44It was also submitted that there was no evidence which either directly or indirectly was inconsistent with paragraph 33 of Dr Seidler's report. Accordingly, it was submitted no error had been disclosed by the sentencing judge in assessing the objective gravity of the offence. 

45In his oral submissions, Ms Mathur contended (transcript, 6 July 2011 at p.2):- 

""In my respectful submission, that finding that the applicant was more than a mere courier, was material error. It was a material error as it had led, firstly, to an aggravating circumstance. That aggravating circumstance led to, and has a bearing on, the objective seriousness of the offence. The objective seriousness of an offence when it is heightened, leads to either a sentence which is increased or a starting point which is increased. Her Honour at first instance expressly stated in her reasons that the offence had been aggravated. In my submission to the Court, that is a material error. It infected or affected the sentencing discretion ..."" 

46Ms Mathur further contended that, in relation to drug offences, two matters which are of significance in determining the objective seriousness of such offences are the role of the offender and the quantity of the drug involved. In the present case, the applicant's role, it was submitted, was wrongly assessed as greater than that of a courier. This had led to a sentence that was higher than was warranted in the circumstances. 

47It was additionally submitted on behalf of the applicant that he was denied procedural fairness, in circumstances in which no submissions at all had been made before the sentencing judge in relation to the history contained in Dr Seidler's report and no notice had been provided to the applicant's counsel as to the sentencing judge's intention to take the history in Dr Seidler's report into account as a possible basis for establishing a role greater than that of a mere courier. 

48It was alternatively submitted that the history in the report, even if taken into account, did not justify a finding that the applicant was more than a mere courier. It was argued that the finding made to the contrary was erroneous, firstly, because it was made in breach of the procedural fairness requirements and, secondly, it was contrary to the evidence tendered at the sentencing hearing. 

Consideration 

49There are, in my opinion, certain difficulties with the finding made by the sentencing judge that the applicant's role was greater than that of a mere courier. 

50Firstly, no submission to that effect had been made by the Crown at the sentencing hearing. Secondly, no notice was provided by the sentencing judge that she may act on the basis that the history recorded in Dr Seidler's report was evidence capable of supporting a finding that his role was greater than that of a mere courier. 

51After the hearing had been adjourned on 2 July 2010 and resumed on 16 July 2010, the record indicates that no further submissions were taken in the matter and her Honour immediately proceeded to deliver her remarks on sentence. 

52In the circumstances to which I have referred above, it was, in my opinion, incumbent upon the sentencing judge to give notice of her intention to consider whether the evidence could support adverse finding on sentence in circumstances where no such finding had been sought by the Crown. The absence of notice in the present case, of course, explains why there was no submission by either party on the question as to whether such a finding was open based upon the history set out in the medical report and in circumstances where the agreed statement of facts made no reference to that matter. 

53The requirement to afford procedural fairness to an offender in sentencing proceedings has arisen in various contexts. In Baroudi v R [2007] NSWCCA 48, the applicant contended that the conduct of the sentencing judge during submissions on sentence strongly suggested that he intended to act upon a concession made by the Crown Prosecutor in relation to the length of the non-parole period. However, in this remarks on sentence a little over a month later, the judge did not refer to the Crown's concession and imposed a non-parole period of around 12 months longer than the concession. It was submitted that the judge erred in failing to provide reasons for ignoring the Crown's submission and in failing to warn the applicant that he intended to impose a far longer sentence than that contemplated in the Crown's submissions to the Court. It was contended that the applicant had been denied procedural fairness and that, as a result, the proceedings had miscarried. 

54In that case, Price J (with whom Sully and Howie JJ agreed):- 

""33. In the present case, it was open to the Judge to indicate that either his views were tentative or that he neither accepted nor rejected the Crown concession. Such an indication would have afforded counsel to opportunity to dissuade the Judge from imposing a lengthier sentence. With respect to his Honour, his inadvertent failure to do so denied the applicant procedural fairness."" 

55In Parker v Director of Public Prosecutions (1992) 28 NSWLR 282, the Court of Appeal considered a procedural fairness issue in somewhat more extreme circumstances where a District Court judge had disposed of an appeal by increasing the appellant's sentence, substituting a custodial sentence for a non-custodial penalty. In the course of his decision Kirby P (with whom Handley and Sheller JJA agreed) observed:- 

""... Fair procedure requires, at least for important decisions and those critical to the determination of a case, that considerations of importance to the judicial officer's conclusions should be drawn to the notice of the parties affected or their representatives so that a fair opportunity is presented for contrary argument to persuade the judicial decision-maker to a different view. ... It is sufficient to say that, given the seriousness of the order which he was contemplating, (the judge) ought to have exposed his thinking to counsel for the claimant. Against the background of the considerations already mentioned, the high desirability of doing so amounted to an obligation ..."" 

56Finally, in R v Tadrosse (2005) 65 NSWLR 740, it was asserted that the sentencing judge erred in taking into account two matters of aggravation under s.21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Howie J at [19] observed:- 

""In my opinion, a sentencing judge would be prudent to raise with the parties during addresses whether any of the factors listed in s.21A(2) apply to the particular sentencing exercise being undertaken. If the sentencing judge considers that any of the aggravating factors listed are present, it seems to me that, in fairness to the offender and as a matter of good common sense, the judge should indicate to the offender's legal representative that he or she is considering taking that matter into account so that, if necessary, the Court might be persuaded that the aggravating feature is not present or for some reason it should not be taken into account in the peculiar circumstances of the particular case."" 

57On consideration, I have concluded that the sentencing judge was required to warn or give notice to the applicant that she contemplated at least the possibility of relying upon the history set out in Dr Seidler's report as evidence relevant to a determination as to whether the applicant's role was more than that of a courier. In circumstances in which the agreed facts did not suggest the contrary and in which the Crown made no contention that the applicant acted other than as a courier, fairness, in my respectful opinion, required the sentencing judge to indicate that she proposed to regard the history contained in the report as material that could establish that the applicant had acted in a role that was more than that of mere courier. 

58A further matter of concern is that, with respect, the sentencing judge appears to have read too much into the history recorded by Dr Seidler in paragraph 33 of her report. In that respect, I note the following:- 

(1) There is no indication as to who the ""Indian and African men"" were or what their position or role was in relation to preparations for the importation. 

(2) There is no indication that in the three weeks that the applicant was in the company of the three men he was actively doing anything in relation to the criminal enterprise. What the men were doing and why they were waiting there for three weeks is unknown. It may well have been that the Indian and African men were simply functionaries who were there to implement the necessary arrangements at the direction of others preparatory to the ingestion of the pellets by the applicant and him then travelling to Sydney. 

(3) I accept the submission to the effect that the threat made to the applicant that, if he did not swallow the pellets, he would be forced to make his own way back to Malaysia suggests that he was not participating at a medium or high level in the enterprise but rather was being told what to do and was threatened if he did not act in accordance with those directions. 

59Accordingly, I have concluded that the sentencing judge was in error in making the adverse finding as to the applicant's role. 

60The history set out in Dr Seidler's report, as I have indicated, did not, in my opinion, support the inferences drawn by the sentencing judge. The fact that the applicant was in India with the unspecified persons for three weeks without more could not convey the applicant's role was more than that of courier. He may well have been told to arrive at a particular time and was then kept waiting around for three weeks. The fact that he was said to have been in the company of those men does not, of itself, indicate that he, in that period of time, was engaged in any activity associated with the forthcoming importation. 

61Accordingly, I do not consider that paragraph 33 of Dr Seidler's report provided a sufficient foundation from which the sentencing judge reached the conclusion she did about the applicant's role. 

62The impugned finding was potentially a matter of significance, insofar as her Honour expressly referred to it as having been an aggravating factor in determining the seriousness of the offence. The inference is that the sentence was determined in light of her Honour's findings as to the objective and subjective factors. 

63The question as to whether or not the sentence was manifestly excessive or was otherwise the subject of appellable error is discussed below. 

Ground 2: The sentencing judge erred in using the statement of assistance as evidence of the objective gravity of the offence 

64At the sentencing hearing, the Crown tendered an Assessment of Assistance provided by the Australian Federal Police. It was tendered in a sealed envelope. 

65The submission for the applicant was that, insofar as the evidence of assistance revealed anything of the applicant's role in the commission of the offence, it went no further than (and indeed it was submitted significantly less than) the evidence in Dr Seidler's report as to the applicant's role. 

66Whether the use of evidence of assistance was restricted, it was observed, will depend on the circumstances, but normally the information cannot be used against an offender: Bourchas v R (2002) 133 A Crim R 413 at [99]. 

67It was also submitted that, insofar as the evidence of assistance disclosed matters such as where the offender stood in the hierarchy of an organisation involved in the importation of drugs, or that explained how the offender became involved and the offender's state of mind, such evidence may be relied upon by the offender to be used in his favour but not used in aggravation of his criminality in respect of the offence: R v Meggett (1999) 107 A Crim R 257 at 261 per Wood CJ at CL. 

68It was argued in this case that the sentencing judge referred to the evidence of the applicant's assistance in her remarks when her Honour stated (ROS at p.7):- 

""His attempt to provide the Australian Federal Police with assistance discloses a greater knowledge of the whole syndicate than what a mere courier would be expected to know, although his assistance was of no benefit ..."" 

69On behalf of the applicant, it was submitted that, leaving to one side the issue of whether or not such a finding was open on the evidence, the sentencing judge erred in using the evidence as to assistance for the purpose of finding it to be evidence ""as disclosing a greater knowledge of the whole syndicate than what a mere courier would be expected to know"" . It was argued that the sentencing judge erred in using the evidence against the applicant to determine the role he played in the importation and thereby the objective criminality of the applicant: Bourchas (supra). 

70In the written submissions for the applicant, it was stated that it is by no means clear from her Honour's remarks that the information was used against the offender. However, when read in context, it was submitted it is apparent that the view being expressed by the sentencing judge is that the evidence of assistance was confirmatory of the conclusion that her Honour had already reached, on other evidence, that the applicant was more than a ""mere"" courier: Crown's written submissions at [21]. 

71It was submitted that the error compounded the error the subject of Ground 1 and led to a sentence which was not warranted in the circumstances. 

72The Crown alternatively submitted that, even if error had been shown in the use made of the assistance statement, it was not one that was material to the outcome and that this Court would not intervene, particularly as the sentence, it was submitted, was appropriate. 

73Whilst I consider it is arguable that her Honour did impermissibly utilise the Statement of Assistance adversely to the applicant, by reason of my conclusion in relation to Grounds 1 and 3 and the matters discussed below in relation to the sentence imposed, it is not necessary that I express any final or concluded opinion on the matter raised by Ground 2. 

Do the sentencing errors warrant intervention? 

74It was noted in the Crown's written submissions at [24] that the submission for the applicant (written submissions at paragraph [14] and the final sentence of paragraph [17]) suggested that the sentence imposed was so high as to be outside the available arrange, and thereby was manifestly excessive. 

75In that respect, it was observed that this Court may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge merely because (if it be the case) the appellate court would have exercised its discretion in a manner different from the manner in which the sentencing judge exercised his or her own discretion: Lowndes v The Queen (1999) 195 CLR 665 at [15]. 

76The question, the Crown observed, was whether the result reached by the learned sentencing judge has been ""upon the facts ... unreasonably or plainly unjust [so that] the appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance"" or, in other words, was the sentence ""manifestly wrong"" : Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321 at [22] per Gaudron and Gummow JJ. 

77The Crown contended that the evaluative judgment made by the sentencing judge addressed all relevant considerations and has not resulted in a sentence that could be said to be obviously wrong or not open: DPP (Cth) v De La Rosa (2010) 273 ALR 324 at [69] per Allsop P. Accordingly, the sentence could not be viewed as manifestly excessive. 

78The Crown referred to the general sentencing principles concerning serious federal drug offences enunciated in R v Nguyen; R v Phan [2010] NSWCCA 238 at [72] per Johnson J (with whom Macfarlan JA and R A Hulme J agreed) including:- 

(1) Although the weight of the drug imported is not the principal factor to be considered when fixing sentence, the size of the importation is a relevant factor and has increased significance when the offender is aware of the amount of the drugs imported. 

(2) The amount of the drug is a highly relevant factor in determining the objective seriousness of the offence. 

(3) Involvement at any level in a drug importation offence must necessarily attract a significant sentence, otherwise the interests of general deterrence are not served. 

79The Crown submitted that it could not be contended that the findings made by her Honour were not open. In this respect, it was noted that her Honour referred to both the nature and the weight of the drug involved. It was also submitted, that her Honour took into account relevant subjective factors and gave them appropriate weight as well as allowing a full discount for the applicant's plea of guilty. 

Consideration 

80Although no separate ground was raised contending that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive, in the course of Ms Mathur's submissions in relation to Grounds 1, 2 and 3, a number of matters were raised which it was contended had resulted in a sentence that was greater than should have been imposed had the asserted errors in sentencing not occurred. 

81Ms Mathur, whilst acknowledging the limited use of the statistics, relied on the statistics referred to earlier in this judgment which put the applicant's sentence fell within the top 5% of sentences for offences of the kind in question. In this respect, reliance was placed upon the fact that the amount of the prohibited substance (pure heroin at 372.4 grams) was ""at the lower end when the range goes between two grams and 1.5 kilograms"" (transcript, 6 July 2011 at p.6). 

82Ms Mathur submitted that, having regard to the amount of the drug involved and the role played by the applicant, the offence was ""unremarkable"" (transcript, p.6). 

83Reliance was also placed upon subjective factors, in particular, the fact that the applicant had come from a background of poverty and that he would spend time in custody under more difficult circumstances than others by reason of his limited English and the fact that he had no family ties in Australia. Ms Mathur stated ""... In my submissions, those three factors make it, as I indicated, a somewhat unremarkable offence and would not warrant a sentence which places it in the top 5% of sentences with respect to sentences of this nature"" (transcript, p.6). 

84It was also submitted for the applicant at [17]:- 

""The applicant participated in this offence to raise funds to finance his mother's cardiac operation. She has since passed away, leaving the applicant with one surviving family member, namely, his sister. He has no family or friends in Australia. He is culturally isolated. He pleaded guilty in the Local Court, attempted suicide subsequent to his incarceration and as accepted by the sentencing judge, he is remorseful and contrite. The starting point in this case, before the discount for the plea of guilty, was 12 years. Taking into account the circumstances of the case, a lesser sentence was warranted at law: s.6(3)."" 

85In the Crown's written submissions (paragraph [34]), a list of comparable cases was provided, it being noted that the Court's primary concern was with consistency in the application of the relevant legal principles: Hili v R (2010) 272 ALR 465 at [48]-[50]. The Crown contended that a consideration of such ""comparable cases"" does not provide a basis for the submissions that the sentence in question was manifestly excessive. Reference was made to sentencing cases referred to by McClellan CJ at CL in De La Rosa (supra) and to the summary of cases in R v Nikolovska [2010] NSWCCA 169 at [74]. 

86It is not necessary for the purposes of the present application to review all of those cases. It is sufficient to note the following:- 

R v Mirzaee [2004] NSWCCA 315 

87In that case, the offender entered a plea of guilty to an offence under s.233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act 1901 in respect of trafficking in heroin. 

88The amount of heroin imported was 578 grams of pure heroin (in contrast to the present case of 372.4 grams of pure heroin), the trafficable quantity being 2 grams. 

89The street value (which was the subject of some dispute) was argued as being $2 million. 

90The offender's role was that of a courier. He was aged 57 and was given the benefit of a 25% discount for an early plea. 

91He applied for leave to appeal from a sentence imposed comprising a non-parole period of 6 years and a balance of term of 3 years. This Court reduced the non-parole period from 6 years to 4 years and 6 months. 

R v Pham [2005] NSWCCA 314 

92The offender pleaded guilty to importing heroin, being not more than the trafficable quantity under s.233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act . The offender was aged 27 years. 

93The amount of pure heroin involved in that case was 244.6 grams, which represented 122 times the trafficable quantity of heroin (2 grams). 

94The wholesale value of the heroin was $120,000. The street value was estimated at between $611,500 and $856,100. The offender was a low level drug importer. 

95The sentence imposed below comprised a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months and a total sentence of 9 years. On appeal, the sentence was reduced to a total term of 8 years involving a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months. 

Le v R [2006] NSWCCA 136 

96The offender, aged 40 years, pleaded guilty to an offence under s.233B of the Customs Act in respect of an amount being not less than the trafficable quantity of heroin, namely, 117.6 grams of pure heroin (140 grams gross weight). 

97The applicant was a courier and had a low cognitive ability. 

98He received a sentence of 7 years and 6 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years. 

99This Court dismissed the appeal. 

100In R v Bezan [2004] NSWCCA 342, the appellant was sentenced on appeal to 8 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years for the importation of a trafficable quantity of heroin in contrary to s.233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act . The offender had personally imported 490 grams of powder containing 260 grams of pure heroin (worth as much as $900,000) in a marble chess board. He was convicted of the offence by a jury. He was not merely a courier, but had no criminal history 

101In addition to the above cases, the Crown referred to sentences imposed in the following cases:- 

(1) Teehan v R [2006] NSWCCA 401. 

(2) R v Tran [2007] QCA 221; (2007) 172 A Crim R 436. 

(3) R v Jimson [2009] QCA 183. 

102Ms Mathur in his oral submissions identified the way in which he challenged the sentence imposed (transcript, 6 July 2011, at pp.7-8):- 

""The crux of my submission is that the court may well find when it looks at the table outlined in De la Rosa there may well be a number of cases that assist the applicant in his submission that this was a sentence of the upper range and there may well be cases that say that this is within the range. The important issue in this case, however, is that the appeal is under s 6(3), namely, that although the range of sentences may be considered is not considered to the same extent as it were being argued that the sentence was manifestly excessive. 

The key issue is, was an error made, was it a material error and did it infect or affect the sentence imposed. Had that error not been made would a lesser sentence have been imposed and when looking at what a lesser sentence is the court looks at the statutory regime and in this case s 16A and those factors therein and sentencing principles. When looking at that in my submission a lesser sentence would have been warranted irrespective of the fact that there may be cases that are factually analogous that end with the same sentence, namely, a head sentence of 9 years and a non parole period of around the five year mark."" 

103The applicant having entered a guilty plea to a Federal offence, namely, an offence under s.307.2(1) of the Code, in the event that this Court intervenes the re-sentencing task is to be undertaken in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions concerned with sentencing to be found in Part 1B of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). 

104In the event of re-sentencing, determination of an appropriate sentence requires this Court to impose a sentence by application of the principles provided for in s.16A(1) of the Crimes Act . The Court in that regard must impose a sentence or make an order that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence. In such determination, the Court is required to have regard to the list of matters which a sentencing court is to take into account in determining sentence to be passed or ordered to be made as provided by s.16A(2), insofar as those matters are relevant and known to the Court. The latter provision also permits other matters to be taken into account. 

105Division 4 of Part 1B of the Crimes Act , in the circumstances of the subject offence, requires that the Court either fix a single non-parole period in respect of the sentence to be imposed or to make a recognisance release order: s.19AB(1)(d) and (e). In the determination of a non-parole period, the Court is to be guided by the general principles identified by the High Court in Power v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 623; Deakin v R (1984) 58 ALJR 367; Inge v The Queen (1999) 199 CLR 295; Bugmy v R (1990) 169 CLR 525. See also Hili (supra) at [40]. 

106I have concluded that, for reasons set out above, the sentencing process in the Court below miscarried and that the sentencing errors to which I have earlier referred resulted in a sentence which was excessive to the point that this Court should set aside the sentence and re-sentence the applicant. 

107In the determination of both the head sentence and the non-parole period, it is, of course, necessary to have regard to the objective seriousness of the offence including, in particular:- 

(1) That the offence involved the importation of pellets containing compressed powder, the gross weight being 594.9 grams with a 62% purity resulting in a total pure weight of heroin of 372.4 grams. 

(2) The approximate street value of the heroin was said to be between $148,725 and $267,705. 

(3) That the applicant's role was that of courier. 

108In relation to subjective circumstances, the following matters are also to be taken into account in determining the sentence to be imposed including the non-parole period:- 

(1) The evidence from Malaysian authorities which establishes that the applicant had a relatively minor criminal history including one drug offence, possession of a drug, committed on 8 June 2001 for which he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 3 months. 

(2) The subject offence, accordingly, represents the only serious drug offence committed by the applicant. 

(3) The applicant is presently aged 33 years. He was raised in Malaysia in circumstances in which, by reason of poverty and injury to his father, he was required to enter the workforce at the age of 15 years, ceasing study mid-way through his second year of high school to pursue employment and contribute financially to his family. 

(4) He was assessed by the clinical psychologist, Ms Seidler, as being a low functioning man intellectually and, in many ways, was naive socially, which factors, it was suggested, would well have contributed to his decision-making concerning his involvement in the illegal importation. His offending behaviour was assessed as being not of a kind consistent with an inherent anti-social character. 

(5) The applicant's custodial case management file, relevant extracts of which were attached to the affidavit of Janet Kae Witmer, solicitor, confirmed that, since being in custody:- 

(a) He has demonstrated good work performance and has demonstrated a positive attitude towards his work. 

(b) That he has at all times demonstrated a polite and courteous manner to staff and other inmates within the prison industries. 

(c) That he has followed directions given to him by staff and there have been no custodial problems associated with him. 

109Finally, in the determination of sentence, I have had regard to the sentencing for like offences to which attention has been drawn on behalf of both the applicant and the Crown. 

110In re-sentencing the applicant, I have concluded that an appropriate sentence is an overall term of 8 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 3 months, the latter representing a ratio of the non-parole period to the total term of approximately 53%. 

111I accordingly propose the following orders:- 

(1) Leave to appeal granted. 

(2) Appeal against sentence upheld. 

(3) The sentence imposed by the District Court on 16 July 2010 be set aside. 

(4) That the applicant be sentenced to non-parole period of 4 years and 3 months imprisonment to commence on 12 April 2009 and to expire on 11 July 2013 and a balance of term of 3 years and 9 months to expire on 11 April 2017. 

112Accordingly, the first date upon which the applicant will eligible for release on parole will be 11 July 2013. 

113HARRISON J : I agree with Hall J.

		01 December 2011",2011-11-30 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2759781,De Celis (Election Funding Authority) v Lindsay Bennelong Developments [2012] NSWSC 917,"Judgment
1By summons filed on 24 February 2012 the Election Funding Authority commenced proceedings against the defendant pursuant to s 91 of the Election Funding and Disclosures Act 1981.  That provision, created the offence of failing to lodge a declaration in relation to a reportable political donation, that is a sum equal to or more than $1,000. 
2The defendant has admitted the offence.  The circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence require some explanation not least because they bear upon the penalty to be imposed.   
3On 30 July 2008 the defendant donated $2,000 to the Liberal Party of Australia, the New South Wales Division for the purposes of the ""Elect Sydney Liberals the Shayne Mallard Campaign"" for Sydney Council.  The funds were used towards the campaign costs of the Local Government elections of the Sydney Council in September 2008. 4On 4 September 2008 the defendant donated $25,000 to Mayor Patrick Reilly for the purposes of his election campaign in the Willoughby City Council elections of September 2008.
5Also on 4 September 2008 the defendant donated $20,000 to Councillor Stuart Coppock for the purposes of his election to Willoughby City Council in September 2008. 
6These three donations each fell within the definition of a ""reportable political donation"" under the Act.  The Act required disclosure in the form of a declaration to be made within eight weeks of the relevant disclosure period.  Each of the three beneficiaries of these donations lodged declarations with the authority.  However, the defendant did not lodge declarations.  It was required to do so by 26 February 2009.
7Between 1 January 2009 and 2 February 2009, the Authority conducted an audit of recipients of donations.  The defendant was identified as a donor which had not lodged a declaration.  On or about 2 February 2009 the Authority sent a letter to the defendant to remind it of its obligations under the Act.  It is common ground that the defendant did not receive this letter.  
8On or about 21 May 2009 the authority carried out another audit, and again, identified the defendant as a donor which had not lodged a declaration.  The Authority sent a letter to the defendant on 21 May 2009.  This letter was received.  The defendant completed a declaration but, through an oversight, the declaration was not sent.  On 17 October 2011, the Authority notified the defendant of the commencement of an investigation into its failure to lodge a declaration in 2009.  Following further correspondence the defendant lodged a declaration on 29 November 2011.   9The commencement of the prosecution about three months later might be legitimately considered by the defendant as something of an overreaction to its tardiness.  It must be accepted that the legislative purposes underlying the Act are critical to the integrity of the democratic system and that the failure to disclose political donations strikes at the heart of any democracy.  The Authority exercises a function that maintains and enforces a transparent mechanism for political donations.
10However, as with all prosecutorial authorities the Electoral Funding Authority has a broad range of discretionary powers.  It is not obliged to prosecute in every instance of a breach of s 91 of the Act.  It may issue warnings, penalty notices, seek recovery of the donations or enter compliance agreements with recalcitrant donors.  
11The Authority's decision to prosecute in this case was motivated, it is submitted, by the size of the donations and the fact that the defendant is a property developer which had failed to respond to the Authority's letters advising it of its statutory obligations.  Whether those factors warrant the decision to prosecute in this Court rather than in the Local Court or at all, is beyond the scope of these proceedings.  The discretion to prosecute having been exercised, this Court is only concerned with issues of sentencing. 
12Of particular relevance to the assessment of the objective gravity of the offence is the culpability of the defendant.  It is conceded that the defendant was not dishonest or wilfully contumelious in the commission of the offence.  Rather there was a regrettable measure of recklessness in the defendant's compliance with its statutory obligation. 
13True it is that the defendant initially received legal advice in September 2008 to the effect that it was not required to lodge a declaration.  However, it became aware in May 2009 that that advice was incorrect and it completed a declaration yet failed to lodge it.  It is also correct to observe that the donation in combination was not a trivial amount. 
14As against these factors the Authority's failure to take any action for two years and four months after the defendant was prompted to complete a declaration contributed to the defendant's default,  in the sense that the company's responsible officer's belief that the declaration had been lodged subsisted over that period of time. 
15Such a delay in instituting proceedings can not be satisfactorily explained.  If as the Authority maintains, it was important for reasons of general deterrence to prosecute this offence,  one might expect a greater degree of diligence.  The leisurely pace of the decision making process is unlikely to convey to the general public a sense of the gravity of the offence.  It mitigates the penalty otherwise appropriate to the offence because the defendant now stands to be punished for conduct that occurred over three years ago.  Since that time it has taken responsibility for the offence and is genuinely contrite.
16It is not suggested that the donations were designed to, or did in fact, influence any decision making process on the part of anyone exercising powers with respect to property developments undertaken or to be undertaken by the defendant.  In my view that does little to ameliorate the defendant's conduct.  If the donation were made with that object in mind it would aggravate the offence.  However, the legislation strikes at the fact of an undeclared donation because it is the appearance of influence of public officials that arises from such donations and which damages public confidence in the democratic process. 
17In all these circumstances the objective gravity of the offence is not of a high order but nor is it so low on the scale of objective seriousness that the defendant ought to receive the benefit of s 10A of the Crime (Sentencing Procedures) Act 1999.  In my view a conviction ought be recorded.  The monetary penalty to be imposed is however affected by the excessive delay on the part of the prosecution. 
18Taking all of these matters into account, I proceed to sentence as follows.  The defendant company is convicted.  I fine the defendant company $6,000, half of which is to be paid to the prosecutor pursuant to s 122 of the Fines Act 1996.  I make no order as to costs.

2760947,NAR v PPC1 [2013] NSWCCA 25,"judgment

1HOEBEN JA: I agree with Beech-Jones J. I make no comment in relation to the observations of Adams J since for the reasons set out in [42]-[49] of the judgment of Beech-Jones J, the issue does not arise for consideration in this matter. With legislation of this complexity, I am not prepared to express an opinion based on hypothetical facts.

2ADAMS J: I have had the considerable advantage of reading the judgment of Beech-Jones J in draft. I agree with his Honour's reasoning and conclusions, but wish to make the following comments.

3Section 298 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides that compulsory processes requiring production of a protected confidence cannot be utilised except with the leave of the court. Section 299D provides that leave cannot be granted unless the protected confidence has ""substantial probative value"" (s 299D(1)(a)), other evidence ""concerning the matters to which the protected confidence relates is not available"" (s 299D(1)(b)) and the public interest in preserving the confidentiality of the communication is ""substantially outweighed by the public interest in admitting"" the material (s 299D(1)(c)). Whether these requirements are satisfied cannot of course be considered, let alone determined, by the court without inspection (except in the most unlikely case that the applicant - which might be either defence or prosecution - is already aware of the contents of the documents sought to be produced and is in a position to establish the requirements of s 299D(1), in which case it would seem that actual production of the documents is unnecessary). Inspection requires production. In the absence of leave, production, even voluntary production, is forbidden by s 298 subject, however, to the power of the court to make an order for production under s 299B. The envisaged procedure seems to be that notice of an application for leave is to be given under s 299C, which should seek an order for production under s 299B. The reason that the documents will almost without exception need to be produced is that, otherwise, it will be impossible for the court to determine the issues prescribed by s 299D. It seems that in this case no order was made and the production of the documents was sought (and made) pursuant to the subpoena, contrary to the Act.

4Speaking generally, it is obvious that the s 299D issues cannot be considered without examining the documents themselves or having sufficient information to make what might be called the statutory inquiries. The practical reality will almost invariably be that the documents have to be examined. That, indeed, was this case. Since reading the material was essential, the learned trial judge, in my respectful view, had a duty to do so, regardless whether or not it was requested. The application for access, which enlivened s 299D, of necessity implied a request to examine the material. (In my view, it should be inferred that his Honour did examine it.) I readily acknowledge that this places a heavy burden on trial judges but it is an inescapable consequence of the draconian terms in which the legislation is drafted. It might be appropriate for the Parliament to consider empowering the judge to give access to counsel for the Crown and defence to examine the material and make submissions (perhaps in writing to preserve confidence) on whether, and in what way, the s 299D tests are or are not satisfied. This would considerably simplify the judge's task. Such access could be subject to non-publication conditions, including a prohibition on disclosing the material to any other persons, including of course, either police or the accused. 

5It was envisaged here that the subpoenaed material contained protected confidences. It was also expected that they would deal with the complainant's psychiatric state both before and after the alleged offence. To perhaps oversimplify somewhat, the applicant sought, and failed - at least at the very early stage at which the matter was argued - to show that this was or was likely to be relevant to the issues in the trial. The sexual incident alleged by the complainant is denied by the applicant and, on the face of it, it is difficult to see what relevance (let alone substantial probative value) the psychological material might have. However, it is plain that the complainant's credit will very much be in issue and it might be that that material contains information which reflects on her credit. Certainly, the extensive use of prohibited drugs is associated with other criminal behaviour undertaken to support what is usually an expensive habit and might well be relevant to credit. Furthermore, on the complainant's own account, her description of what occurred changed significantly by way of adding further very serious assaults following what she described as a ""mental crisis"". This raises several significant issues, of which the most obvious is whether, in fact, she had such a crisis and, if so, its relationship to the further disclosure and, indeed, the earlier non-disclosure. Whether the material deals with these questions is unknown and, even if it did, it might not satisfy the statutory test. All these matters plainly enough required the judge to examine the material for himself. This was all the more necessary as neither the applicant nor the Crown had access to the material and the judge has the overriding duty of ensuring a fair trial. Furthermore, the relevance of the material is not confined to the approach of the Crown to the issues in the trial. If there were information that might substantially affect the credit of the complainant it might well satisfy the s 299D test. In the very nature of things, the applicant could not identify except in the most general terms what that material might be but it is obvious that anything that dealt with the circumstances of the alleged offence or any connected facts might well be disclosable. The mere fact that the Crown would not seek to lead it does not by any means end the matter. On the other hand, it must be stated, in all fairness, that this was not the way in which the matter was put to his Honour and it is not possible, as I think with respect, to conclude that his omission to deal with the application in this light was an error.

6It is self-evident that the fact that the defence case is that no assaults of any kind occurred cannot be regarded as some sort of admission concerning consent. It is an element of the offence that the sexual acts alleged were not consented to. That element, as with all the elements of the offence, is placed in issue by the plea of not guilty. It will be necessary, in due course, for the trial judge to direct the jury as to the onus on the Crown to prove the lack of consent beyond reasonable doubt and point to the evidence that goes to the issue. It is completely legitimate for the defence to argue that, even if the jury is satisfied that the sexual acts occurred, it would not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant did not consent to them and, for that purpose both to cross-examine the complainant and adduce evidence that went to that issue, including evidence that went to her credit (subject to the provisions of Part 3.7, Division 2 of the Evidence Act 1995). Undertaking such a course is, for obvious reasons, fraught with danger but it is one that the applicant is entitled to take. Accordingly, if there were protected material that reflected on this issue and it satisfied the s 299D tests, it should be disclosed even if, as it were, the principal defence is that the sexual incidents did not occur at all. I mention this because of the potential materiality of the previous abuse suffered by the complainant. Of course, this would bring into play the provisions of Part 3.10, Division 1B of the Evidence Act 1995. The possible relevance of some of the confidential material to the issue of consent was raised by the applicant in reference to the significance of the alleged earlier sexual abuse. For myself, I would accept that the judge did examine the material in respect of this submission but found, if there was a relevant confidence, it did not satisfy the s 299D tests.

7BEECH-JONES J: This is an application under s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 for leave to appeal against the refusal by the District Court to grant the applicant access to certain documents produced to the Court under subpoena. The District Court was not satisfied that the criteria for the grant of leave set out s 299D(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act was made out.

8On 26 April 2012 the applicant was arraigned in the District Court on an indictment containing four counts. One count accused him of indecent assault, contrary to s 61L of the Crimes Act 1900. The other three counts allege that he sexually assaulted his victim without her consent, contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act. All of the offences are alleged to have taken place on 25 November 2010. 

9After the applicant was arraigned he caused subpoenas to be issued to four named hospitals and the Department of Family and Community Services for all their records concerning the complainant (""PPC1""). He did not seek the leave of the Court to issue the subpoenas. It appears that material was produced in response. The applicant sought leave to access this material. His application was initially listed for 4 July 2012. The application was adjourned and ultimately heard and refused on 20 August 2012. He filed his application for leave to appeal that refusal in September 2012.

10The applicant's trial was listed for hearing on 8 October 2012. It was adjourned as a result of the making of this application. It has now been listed for 11 March 2013. 

11Between the time this application was filed and the time it was heard, this Court published its judgment in KS v Veitch (No 2) [2012] NSWCCA 266. KS v Veitch (No 2) construed the provisions in issue on this application, namely those found within Chapter 6, Part 5, Division 2 of the Criminal Procedure Act. The Court in KS v Veitch (No 2) rejected a challenge to the constitutional validity of those provisions. The challenge to the constitutional validity of the provisions is renewed by some of the proposed grounds of appeal accompanying this application.

12Both the Director of Public Prosecutions and PPC1 were made respondents to the application for leave. They were both represented at the hearing. There was no issue raised as to whether the Director had standing to be a party to the application. The Attorney General of New South Wales also intervened to make submissions in respect of the proposed constitutional challenge. 

Leave to appeal

13Before addressing the merits of the application it is necessary to note that there are a number of matters at the outset which militate against the grant of the application for leave to appeal. 

14First, one of the principal reasons for subjecting appeals from interlocutory orders in criminal cases to a requirement to obtain leave is to prevent or minimise the fragmentation of the process of criminal justice (see R v Einfeld [2008] NSWCCA 215; 71 NSWLR 31 at [23] and the cases there cited). As I have stated one trial date has already been vacated due to this application and another trial date looms. 

15Second, the refusal of his Honour to grant leave does not represent any final determination of the applicant's rights. In particular, as I will explain, it is open to the applicant to renew the application for access if an appropriate basis emerges. 

16Third, if the application is refused and no further application for production or access is made the applicant's remedies will not be exhausted. If he is convicted and it emerges that he was wrongly denied access to materials on subpoena he maybe able to demonstrate a miscarriage of justice (see KS v Veitch [2012] NSWCCA 186 (""KS v Veitch (No 1)"") at [42] per Beech-Jones J; and Alister v R (1983) 154 CLR 404). 

17Generally, leave to appeal an interlocutory decision in a matter such as this should not readily be granted, unless an appropriate case is made out of an error of principle which is apt to cause an irregularity or injustice (see Queanbeyan City Council v Environment Protection Authority [2011] NSWCCA 108 at [25] per Whealey JA, with whom Hall and McCallum JJ agreed, citing R v Van Phu Huo (New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, 18 July 1994, unreported).

18In my view, and leaving aside the constitutional challenge, the critical question for this application is whether a sufficiently strong case has been shown that there was an error of principle on the part of his Honour which would warrant an interference with the continued prosecution of these proceedings in the District Court. In relation to those grounds that raise a constitutional challenge, I consider that the critical question is whether a sufficient basis is shown to warrant a reconsideration of the reasoning or outcome in KS v Veitch (No 2). 

19To address these issues it is first necessary to refer to the statutory regime in Chapter 6, Part 5, Division 2 of the Criminal Procedure Act and his Honour's judgment before addressing the proposed grounds of appeal. 

Sexual Assault Communications Privilege

20It is necessary to note the following features of the scheme of the sexual assault communications privilege established by Chapter 6, Part 5, Division 2 of the Criminal Procedure Act. 

21First, there is the scope of the privilege itself. It applies to a ""protected confidence"" which is defined by s 296(1) as meaning a ""counselling communication that is made, by, to or about a victim or alleged victim of a sexual assault offence."" Subsections 296(2) to (5) provide:

""296 What is a protected confidence?

...

(2) A counselling communication is a protected confidence for the purposes of this Division even if it: 

(a) was made before the acts constituting the relevant sexual assault offence occurred or are alleged to have occurred, or 

(b) was not made in connection with a sexual assault offence or alleged sexual assault offence or any condition arising from a sexual assault offence or alleged sexual assault offence. 

(3) For the purposes of this section, a communication may be made in confidence even if it is made in the presence of a third party if the third party is present to facilitate communication or to otherwise further the counselling process.

(4) In this section:

counselling communication means a communication:

(a) made in confidence by a person (the counselled person) to another person (the counsellor) who is counselling the person in relation to any harm the person may have suffered, or

(b) made in confidence to or about the counselled person by the counsellor in the course of that counselling, or

(c) made in confidence about the counselled person by a counsellor or a parent, carer or other supportive person who is present to facilitate communication between the counselled person and the counsellor or to otherwise further the counselling process, or

(d) made in confidence by or to the counsellor, by or to another counsellor or by or to a person who is counselling, or has at any time counselled, the person.

(5) For the purposes of this section, a person counsels another person if:

(a) the person has undertaken training or study or has experience that is relevant to the process of counselling persons who have suffered harm, and

(b) the person:

(i) listens to and gives verbal or other support or encouragement to the other person, or

(ii) advises, gives therapy to or treats the other person,

whether or not for fee or reward.""

22In KS v Veitch (No 2) at [16] to [18] Basten JA noted an apparent tension between ss 296(2) and (4) in that the former suggests an expansion of ""the concept of a protected confidence to include counselling unrelated to the sexual assault offence the subject of the charge, or indeed any sexual assault offence"" whereas the reference to ""harm"" in s 296(4)(a) and (5) appears to confine the concept to the harm suffered by the victim as a result of the alleged offence. In KS v Veitch (No 2) the Court determined the challenge to the constitutional validity of the provisions on the basis that the broader approach was appropriate, especially having regard to s 296(2). No different contention was made on behalf of the applicant in this matter. 

23Second, s 298 provides:

""298 Protected confidences - criminal proceedings

(1) Except with the leave of the court, a person cannot seek to compel (whether by subpoena or any other procedure) any other person to produce a document recording a protected confidence in, or in connection with, any criminal proceedings.

(2) Except with the leave of the court, a document recording a protected confidence cannot be produced in, or in connection with, any criminal proceedings.

(3) Except with the leave of the court, evidence cannot be adduced in any criminal proceedings if it would disclose a protected confidence or the contents of a document recording a protected confidence.""

24In KS v Veitch (No 2) at [23] Basten JA noted that the tripartite structure of this provision operates to prohibit the issue of a subpoena; the production of a document to the Court in answer to a subpoena; and the adducing of evidence recording or revealing a protected confidence except with a grant of leave. The applicant takes issue with one aspect of the Court's construction of s 298(2) in KS v Veitch (No 2). I will return to consider that matter.

25In both KS v Veitch (No 2) and this case, it appears that the subpoenas were issued without seeking the Court's leave, in contravention of 298(1). This does not have the result that the subpoena must be set aside with immediate effect and all documents produced to the Court returned (KS v Veitch (No 2) at [29] per Basten JA and [88] per Beech-Jones J). Instead, the Court can proceed to consider the next step of whether leave should be granted to allow access to the documents by a party (KS v Veitch (No 2) at [88]). 

26Third, the power of the Court to grant leave to take any of the steps contemplated by s 298 or the granting of access to documents as contemplated by s 299B(3) (see below) is circumscribed by the operation of s 299D, which provides:

""299D Determining whether to grant leave

(1) The court cannot grant an application for leave under this Division unless the court is satisfied that:

(a) the document or evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other documents or evidence produced or adduced or to be produced or adduced by the party seeking to produce or adduce the document or evidence, have substantial probative value, and 
(b) other documents or evidence concerning the matters to which the protected confidence relates are not available, and

(c) the public interest in preserving the confidentiality of protected confidences and protecting the principal protected confider from harm is substantially outweighed by the public interest in admitting into evidence information or the contents of a document of substantial probative value.

(2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account for the purposes of determining the public interest in preserving the confidentiality of protected confidences and protecting the principal protected confider from harm, the court must take into account the following:

(a) the need to encourage victims of sexual offences to seek counselling,

(b) that the effectiveness of counselling is likely to be dependent on the maintenance of the confidentiality of the counselling relationship,

(c) the public interest in ensuring that victims of sexual offences receive effective counselling,

(d) that the disclosure of the protected confidence is likely to damage or undermine the relationship between the counsellor and the counselled person,

(e) whether disclosure of the protected confidence is sought on the basis of a discriminatory belief or bias,

(f) that the adducing of the evidence is likely to infringe a reasonable expectation of privacy.

(3) For the purposes of determining an application for leave under this Division, the court may permit a confidential statement to be made to it by or on behalf of the principal protected confider by affidavit specifying the harm the confider is likely to suffer if the application for leave is granted.

(4) A court must not disclose or make available to a party (other than the principal protected confider) any confidential statement made to the court under this section by or on behalf of the principal protected confider.

(5) The court must state its reasons for granting or refusing to grant an application for leave under this Division.

(6) If there is a jury, the court is to hear and determine any application for leave under this Division in the absence of the jury.""

27In this case his Honour was not satisfied that the relevant documents sought to be produced to the applicant would have ""substantial probative value"". Accordingly, his Honour was not satisfied that s 299D(1)(a) was established. His Honour also stated that s 299D(1)(c) was not made out, although I understood that to be a conclusion that his Honour considered followed from the applicant's failure to satisfy s 299D(1)(a). 

28In KS v Veitch (No 2) at [31] Basten JA contrasted s 299D with the accepted test ordinarily applied when parties seek access to documents produced under subpoena, namely whether a ""legitimate forensic purpose"" for their production has been demonstrated. His Honour noted that the effect of these provisions is that there will be a ""significant reduction in the material which might be made available to the accused"" (at [32]). 

29One particular constraint upon the concept of ""substantive probative value"" in this context is that, while the material sought concerned might relate only to the credibility of the complainant, s 299D(1)(a) was nevertheless concerned with admissible material. The restrictions on the admissibility of material concerning a complainant's sexual experience or lack of it as found in s 293 also engage s 299D(1) (KS v Veitch (No 2) at [37]). 

30Fourth, in some circumstances a question will arise as to whether a document that is sought to be subpoenaed or has been provided to the Court does record a protected confidence. In that regard s 299B provides:

""299B Determining if there is a protected confidence

(1) If a question arises under this Division relating to a document or evidence, a court may consider the document or evidence.

(2) If there is a jury, the document or evidence is to be considered in the absence of the jury.

(3) A court must not make available or disclose to a party (other than a protected confider) any document or evidence to which this section applies (or the contents of any such document) unless:

(a) the court determines that the document does not record a protected confidence or that the evidence would not disclose a protected confidence, or

(b) a party has been given leave under this Division in relation to the document or evidence and making available or disclosing the document or evidence is consistent with that leave.

(4) A court may make any orders it thinks fit to facilitate its consideration of a document or evidence under this section.

(5) This section has effect despite sections 297 and 298.""

31I consider the powers conferred by ss 299B(1) and (4) below. The combination of ss 299B(1) and 299B(3)(a) confirm that a Court can ""consider"" a document for itself before determining whether it records a ""protected confidence"". A Court can also make such a document available to a ""protected confider"" without the necessity of considering whether the criteria for the grant of leave in s 299D have been satisfied. Further s 299B(3)(b) confirms that the preconditions for the grant of leave specified in s 299D must be satisfied before access to produced documents recording a protected confidence can be granted to a party, ""other than a protected confider"". ""Protected confider"" is defined in s 295 and relevantly includes the ""victim or alleged victim of a sexual assault offence by, to or about whom a protected confidence is made."" No doubt it extends to their legal representative.

His Honour's judgment

32At the hearing of the application his Honour was provided with a copy of the Crown case statement, two statements from the complainant and a statement from a counsellor, who had treated the complainant for a number of years. The complainant's second statement recorded aspects of the sexual assaults alleged to have been committed by the applicant that were not recorded in the first statement. In her first statement the complainant also disclosed that she had been sexually abused by her stepfather from the age of 10 or 11 to the age of 17 years, but that she did not report those assaults to the police. 

33The counsellor stated, inter alia, that the complainant had a history of self-harm and had, on multiple occasions, been admitted to mental health facilities for reasons relating to self-harm. There was other material before his Honour which indicated that the complainant has had a number of admissions to various hospitals for psychiatric treatment, including the hospitals that received the subpoenas the subject of the application for access. 

34In the judgment refusing access, his Honour identified what was said by the applicant before him to be the three issues to which the documents sought related. The first issue was whether the complainant suffered psychological injury as a result of the alleged assault, as she claimed in her first statement. 

35The second issue was whether the complainant was sexually assaulted by her stepfather, and if so what harm or damage she suffered. The applicant contended that this was an issue because, in her first statement, the complainant recounts that she told her previous case worker that she was submissive to the applicant, not because she was consenting, but because of the effects of prior sexual abuse. 

36The third issue was said to be whether the complainant had suffered a ""mental crisis"" sometime after 25 November 2010, and if so what was its cause. This was said to be an issue because in her second statement the complainant explained that, after her first statement, she had suffered a ""mental crisis"" and that as a result she had decided to tell all that had happened on the day of the alleged sexual assault. 

37His Honour recorded that counsel for the applicant advised that the issue in the trial was whether sexual intercourse had taken place at all. 

38In relation to the first issue his Honour noted that the Crown did not intend to lead evidence that the complainant suffered psychological injuries as a result of the alleged assault by the applicant. His Honour contrasted this case with the Crown case considered in JAD v The Queen [2012] NSWCCA 73 where the psychological condition of the complainant was relied on by the Crown as rebutting a suggestion that the evidence was a fantasy or contrived (JAD at [13]). 

39In relation to the second issue his Honour was not satisfied that there was any relevant link between the nature of the treatment undertaken in the past by the complainant and the issue of consent. His Honour added that the question in the trial was not consent but whether the act occurred at all. 

40In relation to all of the matters relied on by the applicant, his Honour found that he was not satisfied that there was ""any relevant connection between the material sought and any issue in the trial such as that the material has substantial probative value"". As I have stated, his Honour was not satisfied that s 299D(1)(a) was established and appears to have concluded that it followed that the applicant failed to satisfy s 299D(1)(c). 

Proposed Grounds of Appeal - Alleged error on his Honour's part

41Consistent with the approach outlined above I will address the proposed grounds of appeal which allege error by his Honour in refusing the application. I will then address the constitutional challenge.

Ground 1A: Alleged failure to inspect the subpoenaed material 

42Proposed ground 1A contends that his Honour erred in failing to inspect the subpoenaed material in order to determine whether it recorded protected confidences.

43It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that, whilst it was reasonable to assume that most medical records relating to suicide attempts may contain a ""protected confidence"", his Honour should nevertheless have inspected the documents to determine whether the entirety of the documents that were produced recorded protected confidences. In particular it was contended that, before his Honour determined to apply the criteria stated in s 299D, his Honour needed to be satisfied that the communications were made ""in confidence""; that all parts of the medical records related to counselling communications; and that counselling took place that satisfied s 296(5) of the Criminal Procedure Act. The applicant contended that, unless those issues were determined adversely to him, Chapter 6, Part 5, Division 2 was not engaged. If they were not, then the general law's less stringent test of whether the applicant had a legitimate forensic purpose in seeking access was applicable. 

44In my view, this complaint has no substance. His Honour was not asked to determine whether or not the documents recorded a ""protected confidence"". Instead his Honour was only asked to determine an application to access documents recording protected confidences. Thus at the outset Counsel for the applicant stated to his Honour that it was ""an application to gain access to protected confidences"". Further, his Honour was provided with an eight page submission from the applicant entitled ""Application for leave under s 299D of the Criminal Procedure Act ..."". The balance of those submissions were exclusively directed to that topic and did not make any reference to any need for his Honour to first determine whether the documents recorded a ""protected confidence"". 

45None of the parties invited his Honour to review the documents much less to first determine whether Chapter 6, Part 5, Division 2 was applicable. At one point Counsel for the applicant did state to his Honour that the documents sought ""could contain protected confidences"" but that was not accompanied by any request for access to those documents which did not.

46In my view the applicant does not have any prospects of demonstrating that it was erroneous for his Honour to only address the application that was made. Similarly it was not erroneous for his Honour to fail to review the documents individually when he was not requested to do so. 

47In addition, a factual assumption upon which this proposed ground is based is that his Honour did not consider the documents for himself. There is no material capable of establishing that as a fact. To the contrary, in his judgment his Honour referred to his having ""considered the material"". This could be a reference not only to the material that was placed before his Honour by the parties, but it could also be a reference to the material produced on subpoena. The Court was advised that the recollections of counsel who appeared differed as to whether his Honour inspected the documents in court. This difference does not matter as his Honour may have reviewed them in his chambers. 

48It is the applicant who alleges that that his Honour did not consider the material and he therefore bears the onus of proving it. He has no prospects of doing so.

49For the sake of completeness I note that it follows from what has been stated above that it is open to the applicant to make a further application to the District Court for production or access to so much of the material that was previously subpoenaed that does not record a ""protected confidence"". In considering such an application the Court is entitled to ""consider"" the material for itself (s 299B(1)) which clearly includes reading it. Also, as I have stated, the leave requirements in ss 298 and 299D do not preclude the Court from making the material available to the ""protected confider"" (or their legal representative) (s 299B(3)).

Ground 1B: Consent by the complainant to production

50Proposed Ground 1B asserts that his Honour erred in refusing access to the material in that the applicant contends that leave under s 298(2) was not required because the complainant had given consent to its disclosure within the meaning of s 300 of the Criminal Procedure Act. Section 300 of the Criminal Procedure Act specifies an exception as to the circumstance in which leave is required. It provides:

""300 Effect of consent

(1) This Division does not prevent the production of any document recording a protected confidence or the adducing of evidence disclosing a protected confidence or the contents of a document recording a protected confidence, in, or in connection with, any proceedings, if the principal protected confider to whom the proceedings relate has consented to the production of the document or adducing of the evidence.

(2) Consent is not effective for the purposes of this section unless:

(a) the consent is given in writing, and

(b) the consent expressly relates to the production of a document or adducing of evidence that is privileged under this Division or would be so privileged except for a limitation or restriction imposed by this Division."" 

51The evidentiary basis for the suggestion that the complainant provided her consent is said to be a paragraph in her second statement stating: ""I give police permission to access and copy all of my medical records"".

52The question of what obligation would be imposed on the police if they were to receive copies of documents recording protected confidences is a large one. It is neither necessary nor appropriate to determine it on this application. For present purposes, all that need be noted is that this form of ""consent"" is not one that satisfies s 300(2)(b). Such a consent must expressly relate to material that is privileged under Division 2 of Part 5. In this case the complainant only agreed to disclose her ""medical records"" which are not necessarily the same as documents privileged under Division 2 of Part 5. 

53Further to satisfy s 300(2) any such consent must expressly relate to the ""production of a document or adducing of evidence"". This requires, inter alia, the provision of an express written consent to the production of documents at least to, and most probably via, the Court, or the adducing of the documents in evidence. The critical aspect of such a consent is that it is an agreement for both parties to view the material. It is not sufficient that, at the investigative stage, the complainant may have agreed to their production to and copying by only the prosecution or some other entity or organisation such as the police. 

54Further I note that no argument to this effect was raised before the trial judge. 

55This proposed ground does not raise a matter that warrants a grant of leave to appeal. 

Ground 1: Alleged failure to find the subpoenaed material had substantial probative value

56Proposed ground of appeal 1 contends that his Honour erred in finding that the material sought did not have substantial probative value on the basis that ""it would only become relevant if the prosecution sought to rely upon subsequent treatment or counselling of the complainant as corroborative evidence"". 

57As formulated this ground misconceives his Honour's reasons. His Honour did not deny the relevance of the material sought, but instead applied the more stringent test of whether it had ""substantial probative value"". Further, his Honour did not state that the material would ""only"" be made available if the prosecution sought to rely upon the complainant's treatment as corroborative of her evidence that she was assaulted by the applicant. Instead, his Honour noted that, in circumstances where that was not part of the Crown case and it was the defence's case that sexual assault did not occur, his Honour was not satisfied that the material sought concerning counselling subsequent to the assault had substantive probative value. I see no error of principle in that approach. 

58The balance of the submissions advanced in support of this proposed ground simply seek to reargue the conclusions that his Honour reached in not being satisfied of the criteria in s 299D(1)(a) was satisfied. They do not identify any error of principle that would warrant a grant of leave to appeal. 

Ground 2: Alleged failure to consider the defence case

59Proposed ground 2 asserts that his Honour erred in addressing the question of substantial probative value on ""the assumption that the case would be run as presently intended by the prosecution in isolation from how the case may be run by the defence"". In particular it was submitted that his Honour did not have regard to the possibility that the defence may require the prosecution to call or lead evidence in the prosecution case, otherwise not relied upon by the prosecution. 

60This proposed ground also has no substance. The approach adopted by his Honour was to treat the issue of substantial probative value having regard to the way that he was advised that the Crown case was to be conducted and what he was advised the defence would be, namely, that sexual intercourse did not occur. 

61His Honour clearly contemplated the possibility that the issues may develop and change. For example his Honour stated:

""It is not presently part of the Crown case that any subsequent psychological treatment is relevant to any issue in the Crown case against the accused. Should the Crown seek to rely on the complainant's attendance [at] counselling as corroboration of her allegations against the accused then the present application can be renewed.""

62Thus, his Honour was cognisant of the possibility that the Crown case may change, and was also aware that the application could then be renewed and the question of substantive probative value assessed at that time. 

63This proposed ground does not raise a matter that warrants a grant of leave to appeal. 

Ground 3: Alleged failure to consider the complainant's medical history

64Ground 3 complains that his Honour erred in determining the probative value of the material to which access was sought, without properly considering the relevance of the complainant's known medical history. This known medical history was said to be relevant to the reliability of her claimed memory recall, and her motivation. 

65The particulars to this ground assert that it was ""not in dispute"" that the complainant had in the past complained of symptoms such as hearing voices, that she had reported using illicit drugs, that she had been scheduled upon her admission to various hospitals and that she had suicidal tendencies. I will not pause to address whether or not those matters were or are ""in dispute"". 

66The critical point is that this aspect of the application raises an entirely new basis for granting access to the produced documents. I have set out above the issues which the applicant identified as being the basis on which the documents were sought. None of them come close to the basis now formulated for this ground of appeal which appears to be directed towards an assertion that the complainant's medical history renders her a fantasist. An application for leave to appeal an interlocutory order is not an appropriate forum to raise a new basis for seeking access to documents. 

67This proposed ground does not demonstrate any error of principle on the part of his Honour, or otherwise raise any matter warranting the granting of leave to appeal. 

Ground 4: Alleged failure to consider s 293(6) of the Criminal Procedure Act

68Proposed ground 4 complains that his Honour erred in finding that the material to which access was sought did not have substantial probative value, without having regard to s 293(6) of the Criminal Procedure Act. Section s 293(6) provides:

""293 Admissibility of evidence relating to sexual experience

...

(6) If the court is satisfied:

(a) that it has been disclosed or implied in the case for the prosecution against the accused person that the complainant has or may have, during a specified period or without reference to any period:

(i) had sexual experience, or a lack of sexual experience, of a general or specified nature, or

(ii) had taken part in, or not taken part in, sexual activity of a general or specified nature, and

(b) the accused person might be unfairly prejudiced if the complainant could not be cross-examined by or on behalf of the accused person in relation to the disclosure or implication,

the complainant may be so cross-examined, but only in relation to the experience or activity of the nature (if any) so specified during the period (if any) so specified.""

69The applicant contends that it was incumbent on his Honour to assess the question of substantial probative value on the basis that the complainant's statements disclosed that she had been the subject of similar sexual assaults at the hand of another identifiable perpetrator, who has not been prosecuted. 

70No submission concerning s 293(6) was made to his Honour. To the extent that this proposed ground has any connection to the issues identified before his Honour as a basis for the production of the documents it appears to relate to the second issue, namely, was the complainant sexually assaulted by her step-father? His Honour rejected the contention that this issue warranted the granting of access to documents on the basis that he had been advised that the issue was not consent, but instead whether or not sexual intercourse had taken place. 

71On this application, the Crown disclaimed any contention that the presentation of its case would involve it disclosing or implying that the complainant had, or may have had, a general or specified sexual experience. Nothing in the Crown case statement supports any suggestion that it would attempt to lead evidence to that effect. In those circumstances this proposed ground does not raise any matter that warrants a grant of leave to appeal.

Constitutional Arguments

Ground 5: Function vested by Chapter 6, Part 5, Division 2 repugnant to the integrity of State Courts 

72Proposed ground 5 contends that ss 298(1) and 298(2) are constitutionally invalid because the terms of s 299D imposing restrictions on the grant of leave require the Court to perform a task that it is said it cannot perform. In particular it is said that s 299D(1) cannot be applied at the stage of issuing a subpoena because the section requires consideration of the documents sought but that cannot occur as they have not yet been produced to the court. This ""problem"" is said to be accentuated by the fact that it is likely that in many cases the same source will produce some documents that do record a protected confidence and some that do not. The applicant contends that this means that a Court cannot know when it approaches the issue of whether or not to grant leave to issue a subpoena whether it is acting under s 298(1) and must apply the criteria in s 299D as it will not have the documents necessary to resolve that issue. The reposing of such a task on a court is said to be ""repugnant to the nature of the judicial power of a court or the institutional integrity of courts in [New South Wales] which are repositories of Federal judicial power"". 

73A similar argument was initially raised, but not pursued in KS v Veitch (No 2) (at [10(a)] per Basten JA). In any event, the premise of the argument was rejected in KS v Veitch (No 2). If a Court determining an application for leave to issue a subpoena which appears to attract the operation of s 298(1) considers that it is necessary to review the material sought to be produced then it has power under s 299B(4) to make an order requiring the production of the material sought to itself (KS v Veitch (No 2) at [28] and [85]). My judgment in KS v Veitch (No 2) at [85] addressed the logistics as to how that might occur. The applicant's submissions did not address this aspect of KS v Veitch (No 2) much less identify why it might warrant reconsideration.

74The applicant filed supplementary submissions challenging one aspect of KS v Veitch (No 2) which was said to be relevant to this proposed ground of appeal, namely the conclusion that s 298(2) is not directed to production to a party but rather to constraining production by a holder of documents containing a protected confidence to the Court (at [23] per Basten JA). The only real support for the applicant's contention is to be found in my reasons in KS v Veitch (No 2) at [88] where I referred to allowing ""production of the document to a party under s 298(2)"". On reflection I agree with Basten JA and Hall J on this issue. The question of granting leave to obtain access is addressed by s 299B(3). In any event, I see no reason to reopen this aspect of KS v Veitch (No 2). It would make no difference to the outcome of this ground which, as I have explained, is premised on a point that was comprehensively rejected by the Court in KS v Veitch (No 2).

75The submissions in support of proposed ground 5 do not raise any matter that warrants a grant of leave to appeal. 

Ground 6: Kable

76Ground 6 contends that Chapter 6, Part 5, Division 2 of the Criminal Procedure Act is invalid because the conditional prohibition found within s 299D is beyond the legislative power of the parliament of New South Wales. It is submitted that the effect of s 299D is that it is a direction to judicial officers to ""act in a manner which will lead to both an unfair judicial process and ultimately an unfair trial"". The applicant's submissions refer to a number of decisions concerning the operation of Chapter III of the Constitution and then rely on the High Court's decision in Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [1996] HCA 24; 189 CLR 51 and the cases that have considered that decision. It is submitted that ""the legislature cannot impair the institutional integrity of a court"". The applicant asserts that Chapter 6, Part 5, Division 2 and especially s 299D effects such an impairment. 

77The same argument was considered and rejected in KS v Veitch (No 2). In that case the contention was that:

""39 ... although the offences arose under State law in a State court, their effect was to deprive State courts of a characteristic essential to their continued operation as repositories of federal jurisdiction under Ch III of the Constitution. Thus Ch III imposed a constitutional restraint on the power of a State to vary traditional procedures operating in the conduct of criminal trials if to do so would render such trials unfair.""

78This contention was rejected by the Court in KS v Veitch (No 2) at [63] to [67] per Basten JA (with Harrison J and myself agreeing): 

""63 Three factors are critical to the proper disposal of the constitutional challenge. First, the law in question is a State law relating to evidence and procedure which does not (and cannot) apply of its own force in federal jurisdiction. Accordingly it does not directly engage principles regarding the scope of federal judicial power. The cases in which a challenge has been raised to the constitutional validity of a law limiting the availability of commonly used procedures, or rules of evidence, have arisen in federal jurisdiction. Their application in relation to State jurisdiction is less clear, not only because the doctrine of the separation of powers has a different operation under State law, but because their relationship with aspects of the separation of powers is indirect.

64 Secondly, because it is a law relating to evidence and procedure, it stands squarely within the power of the Parliament with respect to the regulation of criminal trials. It reflects a public policy which has received greater attention and emphasis in recent years than in earlier times, but is arguably a product of more enlightened attitudes towards the victims of sexual offences and the importance of balancing the legitimate interests of the accused against the legitimate interests of victims of sexual assaults. The law is neither arbitrary nor manifestly disproportionate in its response to a perceived weakness in traditional trial procedure: cf Williamson at 117 (Isaacs J).

65 Thirdly, as noted by Gummow J in Nicholas, its effect may be to make it more difficult for an accused person in certain circumstances to defend himself. Nevertheless, to protect the confidences as between the victim and a counsellor is not to deprive the accused of some source of information to which he is presumptively entitled. Nor is the exclusion of protected confidences a law which would tend to bring the criminal trial process into disrepute.

66 There are other areas of the law where public interests justify exclusion of documents or other information from disclosure in criminal or civil proceedings. Obvious examples are public interest immunity (which may extend to national security or to the identify of police informers) and client legal privilege (which covers communications between client and lawyer). In some jurisdictions protection is given to doctor/patient communications generally (therapeutic privilege), to priest and penitent communications and to those providing information to journalists. Such matters illustrate the acceptance that the interest of the courts in determining proceedings, including criminal proceedings, on all available evidence must in some circumstances be qualified to the protection of other public interests. The protection of sexual assault communications involves a balance of policies which has been determined in a particular way by the State Parliament and in which, subject to constitutional constraints, the court should not interfere. 

67 The final step in the argument is the proposition that, although the choice was one available to the State Parliament, the imposition of the privilege diminishes the character of a State court in which it must be applied in such a way as to render the court an inappropriate vehicle for the reception of federal jurisdiction. Because the Commonwealth has no direct interest in regulating sexual offences within a State, it is largely hypothetical to ask whether the sexual assault communications privilege could be adopted as part of Commonwealth law. However, for the reasons given above, there is no reason to suppose that it would impinge unconstitutionally on the exercise of federal judicial power if the Commonwealth sought to protect victims of sexual assault from disclosure of counselling confidences. Accordingly the constitutional challenge must fail."" (emphasis added)

79The applicant's supplementary submissions takes issue with this analysis. The applicant (respectfully) submits that Basten JA was in error in KS v Veitch (No 2) at [63] in stating that the provisions in questions involve ""a State law relating to evidence and procedure which does not (and cannot) apply of its own force in federal jurisdiction"". He notes that such state laws will apply to the exercise of federal jurisdiction by the operation of s 79(1) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). This submission only demonstrates the correctness of Basten JA's analysis. When a state law is picked up and applied by s 79(1) of the Judiciary Act it is not applying ""of its own force"". 

80The applicant's submissions on this ground also instance examples of Commonwealth offences which, if prosecuted in New South Wales courts, may engage Chapter 6, Part 5, Division 2 of the Criminal Procedure Act (eg sexual slavery and servitude: s 270.6 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth)). He submits that, with such prosecutions, the state law, being Division 2 of Part 5, ""would apply in that context"". Nothing in KS v Veitch (No 2) suggests to the contrary. The applicant also submits that Basten JA's ""reference [presumably at [63] of KS v Veitch (No 2)] to the distinct nature of the separation of powers at state level ... is not a basis to hold that the Kable principle does not apply"". Nothing in KS v Veitch (No 2) suggests that the ""Kable principle does not apply"". To the contrary, in KS v Veitch (No 2) at [63] to [67] Basten JA alluded to a potentially different standard of constitutional scrutiny of laws regulating the practice and procedure of state courts exercising federal jurisdiction (ie Kable and the cases that have considered it) compared with laws regulating the practice and procedure of courts established under Chapter III. In KS v Veitch (No 2) at [67] his Honour concluded that Chapter 6, Part 5, Division 2 met the standard for the latter which had the consequence that it satisfied the standard for the former.

81KS v Veitch (No 2) is a recent and considered judgment of this Court. Nothing in the applicant's submissions on these grounds warrants any reconsideration of it. 

82I propose that the application for leave to appeal be refused.

2762422,R v Harpur [2013] NSWDC 245,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: Those of us who deal with drug supply offences on a regular basis are familiar with the significant sums of money which can be made by those who are willing to supply drugs to others. That provides something of a temptation to those who are willing to deal in drugs for their own financial gain. People are prepared to make money by causing misery to others through supplying them with harmful, addictive and destructive drugs.

2We have an example of this before the Court today. Timothy Harpur is a drug supplier. He is in that category of drug supply traditionally regarded as one of the most serious. He does not use drugs. He does not appear as a desperate individual wracked by addiction. He appears before the Court today as someone who has got involved in drug supply activities purely for the money that he could get.

3In October 2012 police were monitoring telephone calls and SMS messages on a telephone service used by the offender. They were aware of SMS communications whereby the offender agreed to meet with a John Tan on 5 November 2012. Police watched as a transaction took place whereby the offender supplied Mr Tan with 141.2 grams of methylamphetamine and Mr Tan gave the offender in response $38,000.

4Both Mr Tan and the offender were arrested soon after the transaction took place. Mr Tan was found to have in his possession five separate bags of methylamphetamine with quite a high purity, 80% in fact. The offender was found to have in his possession the purchase price $38,000 in cash.

5Police then searched the offender's car and they found other drugs, in particular seven individual clear plastic bags containing cocaine. There was 18.2 grams of that drug with a purity of 70.5%.

6Police then went to the offender's premises and found two prohibited weapons, a knuckleduster and a Taser. The offender had permits for neither weapon.

7He pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity to two offences of supplying a prohibited drug, one relating to the methylamphetamine and one relating to the cocaine.

8There was something of a technical problem in relation to one of the Court Attendance Notices and so he was arraigned in this Court on the supply methylamphetamine matter but it remains the case that he had pleaded guilty to that offence at the earliest opportunity. The sentences that I will impose upon him are thus 25% less than they would otherwise have been.

9As well as those matters, he also asked me to take into account when I sentence him for the methylamphetamine matter, three other offences, one is an offence of possessing the $38,000 I have mentioned. Given the circumstances of this offence it would be double counting were I to add any significant punishment to the offender because of that matter but the other two offences to be taken into account are not in the same category.

10He has also asked that I take into account the offences of possessing the knuckleduster and Taser without a permit. They are nasty weapons whose only real purpose can be to inflict significant injury upon other people. I will take those matters into account when I sentence him for the supply methylamphetamine matter.

11The offender is almost 30 years of age and has no previous criminal history. It is somewhat remarkable that he would commence a criminal career with such a significant couple of offences as these. When I say, 'commence a criminal career' I do not intend in any way suggest that he will continue to commit crimes. It is my hope that the significant punishment which I will inflict upon him in a short time will act as a significant deterrent to him in order to persuade him that next time he wants to make some money he chooses a less lucrative but more law abiding means of doing so.

12There is no suggestion that Mr Harpur was in financial difficulties, no suggestion that he was behind in his rent or any other form of financial embarrassment that might lead to him giving into the temptation to make money in the way he has. Indeed, he appears to have been successful in his chosen career as a personal trainer. A number of references tendered to court today speak highly of him. He has clients as a personal trainer who regard him highly and who are aware of the charges that he now faces, and the likely penalty that must be imposed.

13Notwithstanding those matters, each of the referees indicates a willingness to support Mr Harpur on his release from custody and to resume his services as a personal trainer.

14There is nothing in Mr Harpur's background which would suggest a predisposition to committing offences of this kind, and like many others who appear for sentence in this Court he has no real excuse as to why he would have done what he did.

15He has clearly been involved with sport and physical fitness for a large part of his life. To him health and fitness are important, as is hard work. As well as working as a self-employed fitness trainer, he occasionally contracts as a commercial carpet layer.

16He works as a hire car driver every second weekend and as a boxing trainer as well. There is, therefore, much that Mr Harpur is entitled to be proud of as regards his lifestyle and his character. What he is certainly not entitled to be proud of is the way he chose to make some extra money.

17He chose to deal in a substance which does cause harm to a large number of people, and he was prepared to make money at the expense of those. Fortunately because of police intervention the drugs that would otherwise have made there way on to the streets and into the bodies of drug users was seized by police so they were never actually distributed.

18Mr Harpur has had some drug use himself in the past but consistent with his desire to keep fit he ceased all drug use over five years ago and rarely even drinks alcohol.

19It is conceded that a fulltime custodial sentence is required. Mr Ainsworth asks that I make a finding of special circumstances in the offender's favour. It is no longer the case, if it ever was, that simply being sent to gaol for the first time amounts to a special circumstance but considering the offender's prior good character, considering the substantial bank of good character on which he is entitled to rely committing his first offences at almost 30 years of age, I am satisfied that the minimum period that the offender must serve in order to reflect the objective gravity of his offending in the circumstances in which it was committed is such that a finding of special circumstances can be made in the offender's favour.

20There were two drugs involved, one actually supplied, and one clearly in the offender's possession for the purpose of later supply.

21I will impose sentences which are partially accumulative to reflect the fact that there is extra criminality involved in the two offences. The sentences I impose are as follows;

22For the offence of supplying cocaine, I set a fixed term of imprisonment of nine months to date from 26 September 2013, that is today. That is a fixed term because of the sentence I will now impose on the other matter.

23For the offence of supplying methylamphetamine taking into account the matters on the Form 1, I set a term of imprisonment consisting of a nonparole period of six months and a head sentence of 18 months to date from 26 March 2014. The nonparole period will thus expire on 25 September next year, 2014 on which day the offender is to be released on parole.

2763746,Clavel v Savage (No 4) [2014] NSWSC 463,"Judgment

 

1HIS HONOUR: On 14 June 2013, the Court, as presently constituted, issued judgment (""the earlier judgment"", Clavel v Savage [2013] NSWSC 775) in this matter and set a timetable for further submissions relating to liability and quantum against the first and second defendants based upon the findings of fact in the foregoing judgment and in relation to costs for the entire proceedings.

 

2Due to the issues associated with the unavailability of legal representatives for the first and second plaintiffs the timetable was not the subject of adherence and was altered on a number of occasions.

 

3Notwithstanding the continuing unavailability of the instructing solicitor for the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs filed a submission dealing with these issues on 14 November 2013 and the first and second defendants filed a submission in reply on or about 6 and 9 December 2013 respectively. The third defendant's application in relation to costs was, in accordance with the timetable, made on or about 10 July 2013. The matter was listed for hearing in relation to the remaining issues on 13 December 2013. Despite the disadvantage to which the plaintiffs referred in dealing with evidence relating to costs, the plaintiffs did not seek for the matter to be further adjourned and the disadvantage was more theoretical than apparent, given the Court's acceptance of statements from the bar table relating to issues in dispute. As a consequence, the Court will deal with the matter on the basis of the acceptance of those statements from the bar table and the submissions made in writing and orally.

 

Case Against the First and Second Defendants

 

4At [866] of the earlier judgment and following, the nature of the claim against Mr and Mrs Savage and the manner that it was pleaded was addressed. The cause of action against Mr and Mrs Savage was confined to intentional infliction of emotional distress. There was no cause of action against either of Mr or Mrs Savage in assault or battery, nuisance or trespass.

 

5At one stage it was suggested that the reference at [79] of the Second Further Amended Statement of Claim to the acts of Mr and Mrs Savage in paragraphs [2]-[13] was ""a typographical error"". I do not accept the error was ""typographical"".

 

6Nevertheless, as submitted correctly, the proceedings were conducted on the basis that the allegations of fact at [66]-[78] were the basis for the cause of action, the intention for which is pleaded at [79] and the damages from which are pleaded at [80] and [81]. I will consider the cause of action against Mr and Mrs Savage on that basis.

 

7I reiterate that the only cause of action against Mr and Mrs Savage is a cause of action based upon the tort described in Wilkinson v Downton [1987] 2 QB 57. I have already stated that there is no claim against Mr or Mrs Savage in assault or battery; nor is there a claim in nuisance or trespass (except to the extent that Wilkinson v Downton is a trespass on the person).

 

8The only ""wrongful"" conduct found against Mr and Mrs Savage (and for these purposes I do not differentiate between the first and second defendants) was described in the earlier judgment. The term ""wrongful"" was used in order to signify that no finding was being made that the conduct was tortious or gave rise to a cause of action. I found that:

 

(i)Mr Savage caused stones to be thrown onto the roof of Mr and Mrs Clavel's home in or about October 1999 (earlier judgment at [894]);

 

(ii)A laser beam was shone into the lounge room or home of Mr and Mrs Clavel by Mr Savage on or about 25 February 2000 (earlier judgment at [903]);

 

(iii)On or about 14 January 2000, Mr Savage yelled abuse to Mr Clavel including that he was ""a sick man"" and enquiring as to whether or not he had taken his medications (earlier judgment at [907]);

 

(iv)On or about 16 January 2000, Mrs Savage, in response to suggestive conduct by Mr Clavel accused Mr Clavel, of having a sexual problem and of being a paranoid psychotic (earlier judgment at [899] and [905]).

 

9The issue arises as to whether that conduct is, or any of it, the basis for a cause of action as alleged.

 

10I deal first with the incident of 16 January 2000. Before doing so, it is necessary to restate the conclusions as to the elements of the tort on which the plaintiffs rely.

 

11In the earlier judgment at [36] I upheld the view that there is currently in Australia a tort of intentional infliction of harm, including psychiatric injury, the elements of which are:

 

(i)A deliberate act (hereinafter, ""the conduct"") by the putative tortfeasors;

 

(ii)An intention (including reckless indifference) to cause physical or psychiatric harm by the conduct;

 

(iii)The occasioning of harm (including psychiatric injury, but not mere distress) as a result of the conduct;

 

(iv)The harm being caused to a person to whom harm is intended (or a person in the immediate vicinity to whose harm the perpetrator is recklessly indifferent);

 

(v)In circumstances where the conduct was reasonably likely to cause harm in a normal person;

 

(vi)The putative tortfeasor has engaged in the conduct without justification or lawful excuse.

 

12Dealing then with the events of 16 January 2000, the Court, in the earlier judgment, held that the conduct was confined to the exchange of abuse between Mrs Savage and Mr Clavel. The Court accepted the version of events recounted by Mrs Savage. In other words, the conduct about which complaint is made is in the following context.

 

13Mrs Savage was hanging out washing. Mr Clavel made a suggestive motion (undoing his zipper), which ceased with the arrival of another. In response to the suggestive motion with his zipper and hand, Mrs Savage referred to Mr Clavel as a paranoid psychotic and to him having a sexual problem. The Court does not accept that, on that day, Mrs Savage made any other comment of any relevance.

 

14The Court concludes that Mrs Savage's conduct was a reaction to the conduct of Mr Clavel. In those circumstances, and leaving aside any other element of the tort, the Court does not find that Mrs Savage's conduct was other than a reaction to the conduct of Mr Clavel, and in particular, was not performed with an intention to cause physical or psychiatric harm, nor a reckless indifference to the causing of physical or psychiatric harm.

 

15While I will deal with the matter more fully in relation to the other conduct about which complaint is made, which analysis applies with greater force to the events, as I find them, on 16 January 2000, I also do not consider that this event, of itself, or in combination with other events, occasioned harm of the kind that is necessary, as discussed in the earlier judgment. Nor do I consider that the conduct in question was reasonably likely to cause harm in a normal person.

 

16Moreover, given the provocative conduct of Mr Clavel, to which this was a reaction, it is not at all clear that the conduct of Mrs Savage, in relation to this particular incident, was without justification or lawful excuse.

 

17As a consequence, the events that, in my finding, occurred on 16 January 2000, do not give rise to a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress as that tort was described in the earlier judgment.

 

18That which remains to be considered is the following conduct of Mr Savage: throwing stones onto the roof of Mr and Mrs Clavel's home in or about October 1999 (earlier judgment [894]); the exchange of abuse between him and Mr Clavel on or about 14 January 2000 (earlier judgment [899]-[900]); and the laser beam incident of 25 February 2000 (earlier judgment [901] and following).

 

19The plaintiffs urged the Court to consider that conduct in context of the other events that were occurring at Mackerel Beach. The difficulty with such a course is that most of the other events about which the plaintiffs complain are not events the responsibility of which can be sheeted home to Mr or Mrs Savage. Further, most of them are matters about which there is no complaint on the pleadings (assuming, in that remark, that the pleadings claim damage from Mr and Mrs Savage beyond that which is contained in paragraphs 2 to 13 of the Further Amended Statement of Claim).

 

20In the case of Mr Savage there are three episodes of conduct that I have found ""wrongful"": the throwing of stones onto the roof; the exchange of abuse; and the shining of a red laser beam into Mr and Mrs Clavel's house. It is necessary to deal with each of them individually and together, bearing in mind, also, the submission that each incident should be seen in the context of more general behaviour.

 

21The elements of the Wilkinson v Downton tort make clear that it is not intended to arise from the exchange of abuse between persons. While such statements are deliberate acts they are not statements that would generally meet the criteria that the conduct would be reasonably likely to cause harm in a normal person.

 

22As I have determined in the earlier judgment, Mr Clavel ""gave as good as he got"". There was an exchange of abuse, Mr Savage yelled abusive language, including that Mr Clavel was ""a sick man"" and enquiring whether he had taken his medication.

 

23The pleading, necessarily, does not plead evidence; it pleads only fact. Nevertheless, the facts as found are that Mr Clavel also yelled abuse in what was an exchange between two adults. Other than the fact that Mr Savage's comments were deliberate, I am not satisfied of any other element, in relation to this incident, that would satisfy the elements that give rise to the cause of action under Wilkinson v Downton.

 

24I deal next with the incident associated with throwing stones on the roof of the Clavels. Plainly, such conduct is a trespass. Mr Clavel does not sue in trespass. Nor does Mrs Clavel. Further, such conduct is plainly childish and discloses a significant immaturity of approach by Mr Savage. Does it also satisfy the elements for a claim in damages under intentional infliction of emotional distress?

 

25Again, the throwing of the stones was a deliberate act, and therefore satisfies the first element. Further, the sixth element (as recited by me at [36] of the earlier judgment), which requires that the conduct be engaged in without justification or lawful excuse, is also satisfied.

 

26The plaintiff has the onus of proof, as stated in the earlier judgment, and I am not satisfied on the evidence adduced in the proceedings that, to the extent Mr or Mrs Clavel suffer a psychiatric injury, and not mere distress, it is as a result of stones being thrown on the roof.

 

27Even ignoring, for present purposes, the effect on the mental state of Mr Clavel of the childhood traumas suffered by him, it is unlikely that the stones on the roof, of themselves, would cause a psychiatric injury of the kind suggested. That is also true, leaving aside the reference to childhood trauma, of Mrs Clavel. Moreover, it is not conduct that would be reasonably likely to cause that kind of harm in a normal person. Nor do I consider that harm was in fact caused by this particular conduct, at least of itself. Further, even with other events, this conduct was not a substantial contributing factor to any injury.

 

28Lastly, on the evidence before the Court, I cannot conclude that there was an intention (including reckless indifference) to cause physical or psychiatric harm (of the kind to which reference has been made).

 

29The shining of the laser beam into Mr and Mrs Clavel's house is conduct of a more serious kind than the other incidents that I have already dealt with in this judgment. The incident itself was described by each of Mr Clavel, Mrs Clavel and their son Benjamin Clavel and the accounts of the incident are contained in the earlier judgment.

 

30Essentially, Mr Savage shone a laser pointer into the lounge area of Mr and Mrs Clavel. It displayed a red light on the ceiling and occasionally on the wall and also, at one point, onto Ms Poulton's face. Ms Poulton, as is recited in the earlier judgment, was a visitor in the home of Mr and Mrs Clavel. As a consequence of the red beam, each of the persons present in the home crouched low. At one point there was a suggestion by Benjamin Clavel that it was possible the laser beam might be attached to the end of a gun.

 

31At the time that statement was made, namely 25 January 2000, Benjamin Clavel was unaware that Mr Savage owned a gun. Nevertheless, Mr Clavel was aware of it. Mr Savage had told him some years before. In fact, Mr Savage did not have a gun. The person who owned a gun to which Mr Savage may have had access had left Mackerel Beach some years before the incident in question. It is not clear whether Mr Clavel was aware of those latter circumstances.

 

32As already found in the earlier judgment, I accept that Mr and Mrs Clavel were distressed by the shining of the laser beam. That finding is made on the balance of probabilities. The conduct was deliberate, it had no justification or lawful excuse, but the other elements are more difficult to identify and satisfy. If harm were caused, I accept that it was caused to Mr and/or Mrs Clavel in circumstances where, if it were intended, it was intended against each of them.

 

33I am, on the balance of probabilities, prepared to draw the inference that the act of shining the laser beam was intended to cause distress and was likely to cause distress in a normal person. Leaving aside for present purposes, the absence of proof that satisfies the Court of psychiatric injury of the kind required in order to successfully obtain damages under the Wilkinson v Downton tort, I do not consider that the shining of the laser beam was reasonably likely to cause psychiatric harm of the kind necessary in a normal person, nor occasioned the psychiatric harm in Mr or Mrs Clavel. Further, I do not consider that Mr or Mrs Clavel have proved, even on the balance of probabilities, that the intention (or reckless indifference) of Mr Savage was to cause psychiatric harm of that kind.

 

34As I concluded in the earlier judgment, I do not consider that the evidence of the experts establishes psychiatric harm caused by these incidents at Mackerel Beach, because, at least in relation to Mr Clavel, the opinion that Mr Clavel suffers a form of post-traumatic stress disorder caused by the events at Mackerel Beach is predicated on the absence of childhood trauma that may have caused such an affect.

 

35Nevertheless, leaving aside the childhood trauma, there are so many incidents of which Mr and Mrs Clavel complain, none of which are actionable or relied upon for the purpose of causing damage, yet would have cumulatively been far more likely to cause any psychiatric damage that has been occasioned. Moreover, the number and quality of the incidents, and the matters in complaint, particularly those against the police, relating to the note about the Corsican Liberation Army, the reaction to the explosion and the incident at the Pollack residence are such that the laser beam incident cannot be seen as a substantial cause or aggravating feature of any psychiatric damage that may have been inflicted.

 

36In relation to Mrs Clavel, the ""events"" at Mackerel Beach were a contributing factor to her depression, or the redevelopment of some. As described in the report of Dr Westmore of 25 November 2008, it is the aggregation of all of the events that has been the factor. Moreover, the evidence (and the report) discloses that her predominant fear and anxiety arose from her and her husband's treatment at Mackerel and by the police.

 

37I am not satisfied that the laser beam incident on 25 January 2000 was a substantial cause of, or contributing factor to, the depression.

 

38I have taken into account in examining these ""wrongful"" events, the other activities at Mackerel and the context in which they have occurred. On the one hand, that context is available in order to draw an inference as to the purpose of the conduct of Mr and Mrs Savage. It also makes Mr and Mrs Clavel more vulnerable to damage.

 

39On the other hand, the events at Mackerel for which neither Mr nor Mrs Savage are responsible are, on the evidence, the overwhelming cause of any damage that may have ensued. If there were damage, it has occurred as a result of the other conduct and not any of these events.

 

40I make it clear that if I could draw the inference that it was more probable that any conduct of Mr or Mrs Savage caused the injuries suffered, I would have so held. Intention, as I've tried to explain, merely involves deliberate conduct for which psychiatric injury was a natural or probable consequence (Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Naidu [2007] NSWCA 377; (2007) 71 NSWLR 471 at [82] per Spigelman CJ).

 

41As earlier explained, if psychiatric damage were suffered by Mr or Mrs Clavel, it was occasioned by events at Mackerel for which neither Mr or Mrs Savage can be held responsible.

 

42In those circumstances, the claim against the first and second defendants must fail.

 

 

Costs 

 

43The first and second defendants make no application for any special order for costs. An ordinary costs order will be made. The third defendant refers to two ""offers of compromise"" on which it bases an application for a special costs order.

 

44On 18 October 2010, the Crown solicitor by letter offered a compromise on the following terms:

 

(1)""Verdict and judgment for the third defendant;

 

(2)Each party bear its own cost in the proceeding;

 

(3)This offer shall be open until 25 October 2010 at 9am;

 

(4)This offer is made in accordance with r 20.26 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW).""

 

45As it is clear, from the foregoing the offer remained open for one week only and essentially required the plaintiff to discontinue or accept judgment against themselves in relation to the third defendant and otherwise bear their own costs.

 

46At the time that the offer of compromise, referred to above, was made the costs and disbursements of the third defendant on a party/party basis were approximately $350,000.00 to $400,000.00.

 

47The third defendant submits that, as a consequence, the offer of compromise of 18 October 2010 was properly characterised as an offer of compromise with a real element of compromise contained in it. Plainly, the plaintiffs have achieved less than that which the third defendant offered.

 

48The alternative submission made by the third defendant relates to two letters sent or dated 22 December 2010, sent to the solicitors acting for Mr and Mrs Clavel and offering, in relation to the first such letter, a verdict for Mr Clavel for $175,000.00 plus costs of $300,000.00 including GST, and, in relation to the second letter, a verdict for the second plaintiff of $25,000.00 and costs of $100,000.00. In aggregate, the third defendant was offering $200,000.00 plus $4000,00.00 in costs (inclusive of GST).

 

49The letters of 22 December 2010 were not offers of compromise under the rules, but specifically referred to the principles enunciated in Calderbank v Calderbank [1975] 3 All ER 333 and other cases adopting those principles.

 

50Given the nature of the proceedings and the allegations that were made, and the level of preparation that had occurred, notwithstanding that the formal Offer of Compromise of 18 October 2010 complied with the UCPR provisions, I do not consider that it had a sufficient level of compromise to render its non-acceptance unreasonable.

 

51In some senses, the later Calderbank letter of 22 December 2010 discloses that the conduct of the plaintiffs in refusing the offer made on 18 October 2010 was most reasonable. I do not consider that a different costs order based upon the offer of compromise of 18 October 2010 should be made.

 

52The Calderbank offer of 22 December 2010 is in a different category. Of course, it is not a formal Offer of Compromise. Nevertheless, it is an offer made without prejudice except as to costs. It was more than reasonable in the circumstances. It was expressly open for 28 days, being a reasonable period, and would have achieved for the plaintiffs a result that was more favourable than that achieved in the litigation.

 

53As a consequence, I will order indemnity costs on and from 22 December 2010. There is one qualification that is required.

 

54While no reference has been made to it, the third defendant applied by motion for the admission of certain evidence under s 67 of the Evidence Act 1995. Notice under s 67 was given.

 

55The Court appointed an independent expert to report and some significant costs were expended on dealing with the notice. The notice was withdrawn. The evidence was not adduced. The plaintiffs' costs of that exercise ought to be paid by the third defendant. I allow approximately 5 days' costs for that exercise (out of approximately 52 hearing days) and reduce the costs payable by 20% (i.e. 10% less days plus 10% to be paid to the plaintiffs).

 

56The Court makes the following orders:

 

(1) Judgment for the first and second defendants.

 

(2) The plaintiff shall pay the first and second defendants' costs of and incidental to the proceedings.

 

(3) The plaintiff shall pay 80% of the third defendant's costs of and incidental to the proceedings on a party/party basis up to and including 22 December 2010 and thereafter on an indemnity basis.

 

(4) Proceedings otherwise dismissed.

2765036,Barnes v R [2014] NSWCCA 224,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: 
Offence and sentence
The applicant pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the day fixed for his trial for the murder of Wallace Ruiz-Sanchez. The Crown accepted the plea to manslaughter in full satisfaction of the indictment. The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 25 years. There is no standard non-parole period.

2On 8 November 2013 Price J sentenced the applicant to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years to date from 6 December 2011 and to expire on 5 December 2016 with an additional term of 2 years to expire on 5 December 2018.

3The applicant seeks leave to appeal from that sentence on the following grounds:

Ground 1 - The sentencing judge erred in fixing the commencement date of the sentence on 6 December 2011.

Ground 2 - The sentencing judge erred in imposing a sentence which gives the appearance of double punishment.

Ground 3 - The sentencing judge erred in inadequately reducing the non-parole period given the basis of his Honour's finding of special circumstance.

Factual Background

4On 12 October 2010 the applicant was present with four co-offenders at premises in Marlborough Street, Smithfield. The applicant agreed to be the driver of a motor vehicle to convey himself and the four other offenders to Russell Street, Mount Pritchard for the purpose of collecting prohibited drugs. During the journey the vehicle stopped in premises in Welwyn Place, Canley Vale where a firearm was collected.

5After arriving at the house of the sister of a co-offender, the applicant became aware that another co-offender intended to confront the deceased who lived next door in Russell Street, Mount Pritchard to discuss money owed to him. The applicant, who did not know the deceased, was aware that the co-offender and the deceased ""did not get along"".

6The five co-offenders, including the applicant, left the house together. The applicant knew that the firearm was taken by the group and that a fight with the deceased was a possibility. The applicant saw the firearm change hands between the other co-offenders as they approached the deceased's premises.

7The applicant stood in the front yard of the deceased's premises and saw a fight commence with the deceased. He saw one of the co-offenders punch the deceased in the face and place him in a headlock. He then observed another of the co-offenders attack the deceased. Finally, he saw a third co-offender hit the deceased over the head with the firearm and saw it discharge.

8The applicant admitted that he was a party to the joint criminal enterprise to assault the deceased and that he participated to the extent of remaining present throughout the attack upon the deceased, ready and willing to assist the others if need be. The applicant did not foresee either death or grievous bodily harm as a possible consequence or that another party to the agreement would employ a weapon to achieve that result.

9His Honour made the following additional findings of fact. The applicant's conduct did not involve him physically assaulting the deceased. However, he had agreed with the four others to assault the deceased and it was for this reason that he entered the front yard of the deceased's premises. The applicant did not desist from participating in the agreement even though he was aware that a firearm was in the possession of the co-offenders. He was present during the cowardly attack upon the deceased and remained ready and willing to assist even though the deceased was outnumbered by his attackers.

10His Honour found that the objective seriousness of the offence was mitigated by the following matters. The agreement to assault the deceased was not entered into until shortly before he was attacked and the offender did not physically assault him. Furthermore, he did not foresee that any of his co-offenders would employ the degree of violence which in fact occurred, or that death or grievous bodily harm was a possible consequence of the joint criminal enterprise.

11His Honour took into account the following personal characteristics of the applicant. He was born in June 1983 and was aged 27 years at the time of the offence. At the time of sentence, he was aged 30. On 20 March 2007 he was sentenced in the Newcastle District Court to imprisonment for 4 years, commencing 11 May 2006 and expiring 10 May 2010, with a non-parole period of 2 years expiring 10 May 2008 for an offence of aggravated break and enter while armed with a dangerous weapon. He was further sentenced for robbery while armed with an offensive weapon to imprisonment for 4 years 6 months, commencing 11 May 2007 and concluding 10 November 2011, with a non-parole period of 2 years expiring 10 May 2009.

12His Honour noted that at the time of the manslaughter, the applicant was on parole for the offence of armed robbery and his Honour treated that as a matter of aggravation. Because of his criminal history, his Honour gave more weight to considerations of deterrence and the protection of the community than would otherwise be the case. His Honour also took into account the need for general deterrence.

13His Honour allowed a discount of 12.5 percent for the applicant's plea of guilty.

14His Honour found that by his plea of guilty the applicant had accepted responsibility for the part that he had played in the death of the deceased and that his plea indicated contrition for the offence. His Honour took into account this level of remorse as a mitigating factor. Despite the applicant's expression of remorse and intention to return to labouring work upon his release, his Honour was not prepared to make a positive finding that he was unlikely to re-offend or had good prospects of rehabilitation. 

15I now set out the following paragraphs from his Honour's sentence judgment, which are relevant to the Grounds of Appeal.

""23 The offender's sentence for armed robbery was not to expire until 10 November 2011 and at the time of his arrest on 17 November 2010, he was on parole for this offence. It appears from the offender's custodial history (ex A TB 8 p 1) that the offender completed this sentence on 6 December 2011 following his return to custody and not on 10 November 2011 as submitted by Mr Brewer. It is necessary to consider the principle of totality: Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70; (1988) 166 CLR 59. The offence for which the offender was sentenced in the District Court and the offence of manslaughter are discrete and independent acts of criminality. This fact does not, however, finally determine whether the present sentence ought to be imposed concurrently, partially concurrently or consecutively: Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 per Howie J at [27]. 


24 The offender's custody until 6 December 2011 was as a consequence of his breach of parole for armed robbery. I do not think that partial concurrency with that sentence would adequately reflect the criminality of the armed robbery or the offence of manslaughter. Accordingly, I consider it appropriate that the commencement date of the present sentence is 6 December 2011.


25 Although Mr Brewer did not submit that a finding should be made of special circumstances, I find special circumstances as the present sentence has been made cumulative upon the existing sentence: R v Simpson (1992) 61 A Crim R 58; Close v R (1992) 31 NSWLR 743. I have determined that a non-parole period of 5 years is the minimum period that the offender must spend in custody in order to appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence: R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 per Spigelman CJ at [63].


26 Taking into account all matters that are relevant to sentence, the appropriate undiscounted starting point of the overall sentence is 8 years. The overall sentence is reduced by 12.5 per cent to 7 years.""

Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in fixing the commencement date of the sentence on 6 December 2011.

Ground 2 - The sentencing judge erred in imposing a sentence which gives the appearance of double punishment.

16The applicant dealt with these two Grounds of Appeal together and I see no reason to depart from that approach. In order to understand the basis for these Grounds of Appeal, it is necessary to set out some additional factual matters.

17In the review of the factual background, the sentence imposed on the applicant for the armed robbery offence has already been set out. The applicant was released to parole on 10 May 2010, which was 1 year after eligibility. On 5 November 2010 the parole authority revoked the applicant's parole effective from 22 October 2010 (the revocation date). The applicant was taken into custody in relation to the offence, the subject of these proceedings, on 17 November 2010 - 26 days after the revocation date. Because the applicant had been at liberty for 26 days beyond the revocation date, a new expiry date was fixed for his armed robbery sentence - 6 December 2011 (i.e., 26 days after the original expiry date of 10 November 2011). The applicant was entitled to have his revocation of parole reviewed on 16 November 2011.

18The applicant submitted that the 26 day period of incarceration from 17 November to 6 December 2011 had been solely referable to the manslaughter offence for which he was being sentenced. In those circumstances, he submitted that at the very least, the commencement date of the sentence should have been 17 November 2011.

19The applicant submitted that looking at the matter from a broad perspective, there was also a question of whether the sentence should have been commenced at a date earlier than 17 November 2011. This was because his requirement to serve the additional sentence was directly related to the manslaughter offence for which he was being sentenced.

20The applicant noted that the reasons given for the revocation of parole were as follows:

(i)Unable to adapt to normal community life.

(ii)Failure to report to the parole officer as directed from 22 October 2010.

(iii)Failure to reside at an address approved by the parole officer.

The applicant submitted that considerations (ii) and (iii) were indirectly related to the commission of the manslaughter offence and that consideration (i) was directly related to it.

21In support of this submission, the applicant relied upon the following statements of principle in Callaghan v R [2006] NSWCCA 58. In particular, the applicant relied upon the following paragraphs:

""12 On behalf of the applicant reliance was placed upon a number of previous decisions of this Court, to some of which I was a party. Two separate strands of authority have emerged. One is represented in R v Eric John Andrews, NSWCCA, unreported, 28 April 1993. There Hunt CJ at CL (as he then was) said: 

""It is quite fallacious to assert (as it is so often asserted) that the prisoner is being punished twice for the same thing in those circumstances. The parole is revoked because, by reason of the further offence committed, it has been demonstrated that the applicant was unable to adapt to normal lawful community life and therefore is no longer entitled to parole in relation to the earlier offence; the sentence is imposed as punishment for the further offence itself committed whilst on parole: R v Ian Jeffrey Gale (CCA, 20 April 1993, unreported) at 3.

That does not mean that there will not be some situations in which it would be just to date the new sentence back to a date prior to its imposition. In my view, however, this is not the case in which to lay down guidelines in relation to when that should be done.""

That statement was adopted by Meagher JA, with whom Hidden J agreed, in R v Brett John Kelly [2000] NSWCCA 557.

13 The other line of authority is exemplified by the decision in R v Kaiva, NSWCCA, unreported, 9 November 1998. There Kirby J, with whom I agreed, said: 

""Secondly, his Honour expressly took into account, as a circumstance of aggravation, the fact that the offence was committed whilst the applicant was on parole. That was entirely appropriate. The sentence which he then passed reflected that circumstance. Having taken that matter into account, to then not backdate the sentence gives the appearance of penalising the prisoner for a second time, in respect of the same matter. That, it seems to me, is also undesirable."" (emphasis added)

14 It is apposite to emphasise here that Kirby J did not hold that double punishment actually occurred; merely that the process gave that appearance. On the same day, the same bench took an identical approach in R v David Webb, NSWCCA, unreported, 9 November 1998. 
15 However, in Regina v Shane John Ravet [2001] NSWCCA 535, Stein JA expressly declined to accept that Kaiva and Webb established any principle. His Honour regarded them, rather, as examples demonstrating that backdating to the date of revocation of parole may be within a judge's sentencing discretion in appropriate circumstances. 

16 In R v Kitchener [2003] NSWCCA 134 the court was constituted by Wood CJ at CL (as he then was) and myself. 

17 There, an offender whose parole had been revoked was sentenced in respect of subsequent offences in such a fashion as to allow credit for only six days of a thirteen month balance of term. The reasons for the parole revocation were not confined to the subsequent offending, but included other specified breaches of parole conditions. 

18 I considered, and Wood CJ at CL agreed, that, in some circumstances, a court sentencing in respect of subsequent offences would find it necessary to attempt the hypothetical exercise of assessing what the offender's parole position would or might have been had parole been revoked not as a result (solely) of the subsequent offending, but solely or partly as a result of his other breaches of parole conditions. 

19 The Crown drew attention to the decision of this Court in R v SAE NSWCCA, unreported, 3 April 1997, per Gleeson CJ, with whom Mason P and Dowd J agreed. Gleeson CJ said: 

""The usual principle is that allowance is made for pre-sentence custody but only in circumstances where such pre-sentence custody is exclusively referable to the crime for which the offender has been sentenced.""

20 I do not accept that his Honour intended to lay down as an absolute rule that, where pre-sentence custody is referable partly to the crime for which an offender is being sentenced, and partly to some other circumstance, such as revocation of parole, that pre-sentence custody may never be taken into account. The judgment was delivered ex-tempore and the passage cited was not essential to this decision. 

21 That the matter is discretionary appears to be the prevailing view of members of this Court. Even in Andrews and Kelly, the court accepted that a judge might backdate a sentence where parole had been revoked by reason of the offence for which the offender is then to be sentenced. 

22 I maintain the view that a discretion exists. There is no clear rule which will govern all cases. The circumstances that bring an offender before a court for sentence after parole has been revoked are far too varied to permit a single absolute rule.

23 It would, in my opinion, in some cases be unfair not to backdate to some point (not necessarily the date of revocation of parole) before the expiration of the earlier parole period. It is always open to an offender to seek and be granted parole even after a revocation; to sentence in such a way as to commence the subsequent sentence only on the date of expiration of the whole of the previously imposed head sentence is to assume that, absent the subsequent offences, the offender would not have been granted a second chance at parole. 

24 However, I am also of the view that, particularly where, as here, the re-offending has occurred within a very short time of release on parole, and the balance of term to which the offender is exposed is quite short, it may be appropriate to proceed on the hypothesis that the whole of the period spent in custody up to the expiration of the parole period is, as Hunt CJ at CL said, referable to the earlier offences and not to the subsequent offences. 

25 Thus, I am of the view that the sentencing judge did have a discretion to make the sentences wholly or partly cumulative upon the sentence to which the applicant was, as a consequence of the revocation of parole, serving. That allowed her a period of six months. She could have specified the current sentences to commence at any time during that period. 

26 The second question which arises is whether is has been shown that the exercise of her discretion miscarried. I am unable to see that that has been established. I would, accordingly, grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.""

22The applicant also relied upon the observations of Basten JA at [34] - [36] and RS Hulme J at [79] in R v DW [2012] NSWCCA 66:

""34 In due course the respondent's parole was revoked, with effect from 30 July 2009, when he was arrested, leaving him with a period of six months and nine days to be served, expiring on 7 February 2010. The penalty imposed for the conspiracy did not in fact commence until 30 March 2010. However, the nine month non-parole period imposed in respect of count 3 was back-dated to the date of arrest and thus was concurrent with (and exceeded) the whole of the balance of parole. The sentence on count 2 (the fixed term of 18 months) commenced on 30 December 2009, thus overlapping with the balance of parole, but only for a period of a little over one month. The 2.5 years non-parole period in respect of the conspiracy was concurrent with 15 months of the fixed term imposed for count 2 (and concurrent with one month of the non-parole period imposed for count 3).


35 Although it was submitted that the commencement date for the sentences for the new offences should not properly have been backdated, the primary submission was that the extent of the backdating, to the commencement of custody relating to the new offences, was excessive. In circumstances where the offences constitute the reason for the revocation of parole, it is important not to double count the fact that the offences were committed whilst serving an incomplete sentence for an earlier offence, and whilst on parole for that offence. It is also necessary to consider whether there should be a degree of concurrency, to allow for the possibility that the respondent could have been re-paroled during the course of the balance of term on the earlier offence: Callaghan v R [2006] NSWCCA 58; 160 A Crim R 145 at [21]-[23] (Simpson J, James and Hall JJ agreeing). A further factor to be taken into account on the appeal is that the prosecutor's submissions on sentence accepted the backdating to the commencement of the new period of custody. That factor is not conclusive against intervention, but is a consideration which may persuade the Court not to intervene in the exercise of its residual discretion. 


36 As a degree of accumulation in respect of the new offences was permissible, the only issue in terms of concurrency was the failure to commence the first of the new sentences at some point after the date of arrest. Given the length of the balance of the term of the offence for which parole was revoked, the sentencing judge was not required to allow more than four months, attributable purely to the balance of the earlier term. That this would have been a relatively short increase in the overall sentence period is a factor which tends to weigh against intervention in the exercise of the Court's discretion, even if satisfied that such an additional period should have been imposed."" (Basten JA)

""79 There is no doubt that the decision as when, within a period of revoked parole, another sentence should commence is a matter of discretion - see Callaghan v R [2006[ NSWCCA 58; 160 A Crim R 145. It may be at the beginning; it may be at the end; it may be somewhere in between. A number of matters are liable to inform the exercise of that discretion. Without attempting to be exhaustive, one is the fact that imprisonment for the period of revoked parole is, in its origins, due to the sentence pursuant to which the period when the offender was eligible for parole was granted. Revocation may have occurred because it has been demonstrated that an offender has been unable to adapt to normal community life. A second, although there will commonly be overlapping with the first, may be as in this case, that the revocation arises in consequence of a new offence for which a fresh sentence is being imposed, rather than for some unconnected cause. A third and fourth are likely to be the period served with apparent adherence to the terms of parole and the periods of revocation and for which the revocation is liable to continue."" (RS Hulme J)

23The applicant submitted that there should have been a period of partial concurrency between the manslaughter sentence and the period of revoked parole because there was an appearance of double punishment. This was because there was a finding that the offence was aggravated by having been committed while on parole. In making that submission, the applicant acknowledged that a finding of aggravation of this kind, pursuant to s21A(2)(j) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 did not prevent a sentence being cumulative. Nevertheless, by reference to the decision of R v Kaiva (referred to at [13] of Callaghan) the applicant submitted that a failure to backdate a sentence in such circumstances gave an appearance of penalising the prisoner for a second time in respect of the same matter.

24The applicant relied upon expressions of opinion to similar effect in R v David Webb (NSWCCA, unreported 9 November 1998).

25The applicant relied upon the observation in R v Callaghan that potential unfairness might arise in circumstances where a sentence was totally cumulative in that such a sentence would make no allowance for an offender having a second chance to have parole granted. On that issue the applicant noted that he was entitled to apply for a review of his revocation of parole on 16 November 2011. He submitted that his Honour should have backdated the commencement date of the manslaughter sentence to that date so as to have due regard to the possibility that he might have been granted parole at that time.

26The applicant submitted that by reference to what was said in R v Callaghan at [24] his re-offending did not occur within a very short time of release to parole, and that the balance of term following the revocation of parole was lengthy. He submitted that in Callaghan and DW these were considerations which pointed towards some level of concurrency between the new sentence and the period of parole that had been revoked.

Consideration

27These Grounds of Appeal are misconceived. To the extent that reliance is placed on R v DW, it should be noted that this was a Crown appeal and the issue before the court was not whether the sentence should have been backdated to the period during which parole had been revoked, but the extent of such backdating. The resolution of that appeal turned upon an exercise of the residual discretion, a consideration which does not arise in this case.

28Callaghan v R is a useful decision because of its review of previous decisions of this Court and the statements of principle therein. What should not be lost sight of is that the effect of that review is that the decision of a sentencing judge as to whether or not to make a new sentence partially concurrent or wholly cumulative upon a revoked period of parole involves the exercise of a discretion by that judge. The exercise of discretion has to be carried out in a principled way but it remains the exercise of a discretion. 

29For the applicant to succeed on these grounds, he needed to show that it was not open to Price J to exercise the discretion in the way in which he did. Unless the applicant could point to a specific error (which he could not) it was necessary for him to establish that the discretion was wrongly exercised on House v King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 49 grounds. This he has not done.

30It is important to note that the applicant had only been on parole for the completely separate armed robbery offence for 5 months at the time of the commission of the manslaughter. When his parole was revoked, he still had approximately 1 year and 20 days of his parole period to serve. By the time the applicant was sentenced for the manslaughter offence, he had already served the balance of his term of parole as a consequence of the revocation.

31There can be no suggestion that his Honour failed to turn his mind to this issue. His Honour specifically referred to it and gave compelling reasons for why, the manslaughter sentence should be fully cumulative on the armed robbery sentence. His Honour's reasons are set out at [15] hereof.

32His Honour's reasons related primarily, but not solely, to the question of totality. His Honour noted that the armed robbery offence and the manslaughter offence were discrete and independent acts of criminality. In that regard, his Honour took into account the oft quoted observations of Howie J in Cahyadi v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 at [27]:

""27 In any event there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. ...""

33His Honour having turned his mind to the question of totality concluded (as was clearly open to him) that partial concurrency of the manslaughter sentence with the revoked period of parole would not adequately reflect the criminality of the armed robbery nor the offence of manslaughter.

34A similar situation to that confronting his Honour came before this Court in Ith v R [2013] NSWCCA 280. There the Court, for reasons similar to those expressed by his Honour, upheld the second sentence being fully cumulative upon a revoked period of parole of 1 year and 7 months. In reaching that conclusion, the Court acknowledged the undoubted discretion of the sentencing judge to cumulate in that way.

35There are other considerations which support this exercise of discretion by his Honour. Of the three reasons put forward for the revocation of parole, only one directly related to the commission of the manslaughter offence. The other two arose from attempts by the applicant to avoid apprehension after the commission of the manslaughter. It is also not without significance that experienced counsel who appeared for the applicant before his Honour conceded that it was open to his Honour to totally cumulate the manslaughter sentence on the revoked parole period (27.9.2013, T.12).

36In the course of the appeal, a subsidiary issue arose. This was the question of whether the applicant should be able to rely upon an affidavit which produced additional material from the State Parole Authority concerning the circumstances surrounding the applicant's revocation of parole. Some, but not all, of that material was before his Honour in the sentence proceedings. 

37The purpose of the affidavit was to ground a submission that if his Honour had been aware of that material, he would have commenced the manslaughter sentence on 10 November 2011, not 6 December 2011. The reasoning appears to be that had his Honour been in possession of this information, he would have appreciated that because the applicant had been ""on the run"" between 22 October and 17 November 2011 when he was apprehended, the parole authority had added that 26 days to the original expiry date of the sentence which was 10 November 2011. Another reason for seeking to read the affidavit seems to have been to establish that on 16 November 2011 the applicant would have been entitled to apply to the parole authority to review his revocation of parole.

38I would reject the affidavit on two bases. The first is that it is neither new nor fresh evidence. The material was available at the time when his Honour sentenced the applicant and could have been easily obtained (as it was for the hearing of the appeal). Another and perhaps more important reason for rejecting the affidavit is that to read it in these proceedings would serve no useful purpose. Given his Honour's approach to the criminality of both the armed robbery and the manslaughter offences, it is most unlikely that he would have backdated the commencement date of the manslaughter sentence to 10 November. This is because the additional 26 days was added to the revoked parole period pursuant to s171 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 to take into account the period during which the applicant was seeking to avoid apprehension. Similarly, the possibility of the applicant successfully persuading the parole authority to reconsider its revocation of his parole on 16 November 2011, only 20 days before the balance of parole period expired, could only be regarded as remote.

39These Grounds of Appeal have not been made out.

Ground 3 - The sentencing judge erred in inadequately reducing the non-parole period given the basis of his Honour's finding of special circumstance.

40The applicant submitted that while his Honour found special circumstances because of the manslaughter sentence being cumulative upon the revocation of parole period, the reduction of the statutory ratio from 75 percent to 71.42 percent was inadequate.

41In support of that proposition the applicant relied upon Fitzpatrick, Sharon Lee v R [2010] NSWCCA 26 where the Court was asked to consider an adjustment of the overall non-parole period after a finding of special circumstances. The applicant relied upon the following extract from that decision.

""32 A finding of special circumstances is purposive, in that it is a warrant for reducing the non-parole period below the statutory ratio. Consideration of factors giving rise to a finding of special circumstances is not always limited to the rehabilitation of the offender but will often be the purpose for such a finding: R v El-Hayek [2004] NSWCCA 25; (2004) 144 A Crim R 90 at [105].

33 Can it be said in the present case that his Honour's finding of special circumstances was not carried through in the sentence that he imposed? In the particular circumstances of this case, does a reduction of the non-parole period by only 2 months constitute a failure by his Honour properly or adequately to reflect the finding?""

42The applicant submitted that because the finding of special circumstances in this case was based solely upon the cumulation of the two sentences, the amount of the adjusted ratio should have been greater so as to reflect the extent of the cumulation which was built into the manslaughter judgment.

43This Ground of Appeal should be rejected. The ground and submissions in support fail to understand what his Honour was seeking to achieve by his finding of special circumstances and his adjustment of the statutory ratio.

44His Honour was clearly aware that he was fully cumulating the sentence for manslaughter upon the revoked parole period. Not only was this expressly indicated in the judgment, there was no other reason for the finding. There was no suggestion that the applicant was in need of an extended period of supervision or counselling. 

45His Honour had already made a finding in relation to the criminality of the manslaughter offence that ""a non-parole period of 5 years is the minimum period that the offender must spend in custody in order to appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence."" This was in line with the observation of Spigelman CJ at [63] in Regina v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 where he said:

""63 ... there is the ultimate constraint that the non-parole period must itself appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence.""

46Having determined that 5 years was the appropriate non-parole period, it was necessary for his Honour to make some adjustment to the parole/non-parole ratio for the manslaughter offence, otherwise the combined effect of the non-parole period for the manslaughter offence and the revoked parole period would have given rise to a total sentence which did not reflect the statutory ratio. This can be demonstrated in two ways. The non-parole period for the manslaughter represented 71.4 percent of the total term and when the balance of parole to be served by the applicant (1 year 20 days) is added to the non-parole period for the manslaughter (5 years), it represented approximately 75 percent of the total period imposed for the manslaughter and balance of term (i.e. 8 years 20 days).

47This can also be demonstrated by the diagram attached to these reasons. 

48The effect of what his Honour did in his finding of special circumstances and his adjustment of the non-parole period in the manslaughter sentence was to maintain the statutory ratio when the balance of parole and the manslaughter sentence were combined.

49The orders which I propose are:

(2)Leave to appeal is granted.

(3)The appeal is dismissed.

50ROTHMAN J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

51R A HULME J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

2766156,R v Simmons; R v Moore (No 4) [2015] NSWSC 259,"Judgment


	
	Part way through a pre-trial voir dire hearing, Tony Simmons (“the accused”) and Kieran Moore (“Mr Moore”) applied for an order under s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) that they be tried by judge alone. The application was foreshadowed for the first time by the accused on Monday 16 February 2015 at the commencement of the voir dire concerning the admissibility of admissions or statements against interest made by each of them (T 10).
	
	
	The matter was raised for a second time towards the end of the eighth day of the voir dire (3 March 2015). Shortly before 1pm on Wednesday 4 March 2015, Mr Moore was granted leave to file in Court an election under s 132 along with a notice of motion and supporting affidavit. Mr Young SC, who appears for the accused, asked for time “to give my client one further opportunity to consider his position, having heard your Honour’s judgment” (T 314). This was a reference to the judgment that I delivered that morning in relation to the admissibility of admissions made by the accused to undercover police officers: R v Simmons; R v Moore (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 143 (“Simmons (No 2)”). Shortly after lunch, the accused filed in court a notice of motion and supporting affidavit.
	
	
	The issue was stood over until 9 March to enable the Crown to consider its position. The Crown’s position was complicated. However, the Crown did not consent to a trial by judge alone and so it is necessary to determine whether a judge alone trial is “in the interests of justice”: s 132(4). I heard argument in relation to the application on 9 and 10 March 2015. Further evidence on the application was adduced on 18 March 2015 and further submissions were received on 16 and 18 March 2015.
	
	
	On Tuesday 10 March 2015 I made rulings excluding statements against interest and admissions made by Mr Moore: R v Simmons; R v Moore (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 189 (“Simmons (No 3)”). On Friday 13 March 2015 the Crown indicated that the Director had ordered no further proceedings in relation to Mr Moore. He was discharged on the indictment and his application for a judge alone trial abated. I understand that he is now to be a prosecution witness.
	
	
	The accused read an affidavit of his solicitor (Matthew Lorkin) affirmed 4 March 2015 and a further affidavit of Mr Lorkin affirmed 9 March 2015. Substantial portions of the second affidavit were not pressed (T 429-431). In addition to the affidavit evidence, the parties agreed that it was necessary to receive all of the evidence that had been tendered on the pre-trial voir dire: see Simmons (No 2) at [46] - [50] and Simmons (No 3) at [13].
	
	
	This comprises a 13 volume brief of evidence (Ex VD 1) as well as 14 separate exhibits (Ex VD 2 – VD 15). Neither party made any reference to Ex VD 2 - VD 15. The parties did not identify with any precision the parts of the 13 volume brief that are relevant to this application. When the matter was first argued, it was unclear which parts of Ex VD 1 will actually be adduced in evidence at the trial and it seemed that the accused had not consulted with the Crown to determine the evidence that the Crown intended to lead (T 425-6, 429-430, 432-434). Submissions were made in relation to parts of the evidence that the Crown Prosecutor later indicated would not be lead at the trial. Following a concession by the Crown on the final day of the first voir dire, it is known that a large amount of the listening device material considered in Simmons (No 2) will not be led at the trial: R v Simmons (No 2) at [151].
	
	
	In the absence of a clear understanding of the material to be led at the trial, it was not possible to make a reasoned assessment of where the “interests of justice” lay. The matter was adjourned to allow the parties time indicate what would, and what would not, be led in the trial proper.
	
	
	Exhibits VD 16, 17 and 18 were tendered on Wednesday 18 March and it is now tolerably clear, at least for the purpose of this application, what evidence is to be led at the trial.
	


Relevant Legislation


	
	Sections 131 – 132A of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) provide:
	


“131. Trial by jury in criminal proceedings

Criminal proceedings in the Supreme Court or the District Court are to be tried by a jury, except as otherwise provided by this Part.

132. Orders for trial by Judge alone

(1) An accused person or the prosecutor in criminal proceedings in the Supreme Court or District Court may apply to the court for an order that the accused person be tried by a Judge alone (a ""trial by judge order"" ).

(2) The court must make a trial by judge order if both the accused person and the prosecutor agree to the accused person being tried by a Judge alone.

(3) If the accused person does not agree to being tried by a Judge alone, the court must not make a trial by judge order.

(4) If the prosecutor does not agree to the accused person being tried by a Judge alone, the court may make a trial by judge order if it considers it is in the interests of justice to do so.

(5) Without limiting subsection (4), the court may refuse to make an order if it considers that the trial will involve a factual issue that requires the application of objective community standards, including (but not limited to) an issue of reasonableness, negligence, indecency, obscenity or dangerousness.

(6) The court must not make a trial by judge order unless it is satisfied that the accused person has sought and received advice in relation to the effect of such an order from an Australian legal practitioner.

(7) The court may make a trial by judge order despite any other provision of this section or section 132A if the court is of the opinion that:

(a) there is a substantial risk that acts that may constitute an offence under Division 3 of Part 7 of the Crimes Act 1900 are likely to be committed in respect of any jury or juror, and

(b) the risk of those acts occurring may not reasonably be mitigated by other means.

132A. Applications for trial by judge alone in criminal proceedings

(1) An application for an order under section 132 that an accused person be tried by a Judge alone must be made not less than 28 days before the date fixed for the trial in the Supreme Court or District Court, except with the leave of the court.

(2) An application must not be made in a joint trial unless:

(a) all other accused person apply to be tried by a Judge alone, and

(b) each application is made in respect of all offences with which the accused persons in the trial are charged that are being proceeded with in the trial.

(3) An accused person or a prosecutor who applies for an order under section 132 may, at any time before the date fixed for the accused person’s trial, subsequently apply for a trial by a jury.

(4) Rules of court may be made with respect to applications under section 132 or this section.”


	
	These sections replaced earlier provisions providing for a judge alone trial on 14 January 2011. Section 132 was previously in the same terms as the repealed s 16. Section 16 had, in turn, replaced s 32. The previous provisions (ss 16, 32 and 132) were in substantially the same terms as one another. The introduction of the current version of ss 132-132A made two significant changes to the law. Under the previous regime, a judge alone trial could not be ordered unless an election was made “before the date fixed for the person’s trial”. This requirement was mandatory: R v Perry (1993) 29 NSWLR 589 at 593-594. Attempts to circumvent it (by adjournment of the trial date) were frowned upon although sometimes succeeded: see R v Coles (1993) 31 NSWLR 550 at 553-554. Section 132A maintains the requirement that applications be made in a timely fashion. Applications must be made “not less than 28 days” before the trial date “except with the leave of the Court”.
	
	
	The second change introduced by s 132 concerns the requirement under s 32(3) that the accused could only elect for a judge alone trial if the Director of Public Prosecutions consented. This change was “introduced to remove the former veto power held by the prosecution”: R v Abrahams [2013] NSWSC 729 at [10]; New South Wales Legislative Council, Courts and Crimes Legislation Further Amendment Bill 2010, Second Reading Speech (Hansard), 24 November 201 at 28073.
	


Whether leave should be granted


	
	The parties concede that leave under s 132A is required. The Crown does not oppose the grant of leave. In spite of the Crown’s position, the question of whether leave should be granted in the present case is a live one. The application is tardy in the extreme.
	
	
	From the time the trial date was fixed (16 February 2015), the case was mentioned in the arraignments list on four occasions in the second half of 2014. At no stage was the presiding Judge given any indication there may be an application for a judge alone trial.
	
	
	On 4 July 2014, Johnson J confirmed the trial date of 16 February 2015 with a 12 week estimate. It was indicated that there would be pre-trial issues of some substance. Johnson J asked a number of questions in the course of that mention as to the logistics of the hearing and how its smooth running might be facilitated.
	
	
	On 5 September 2014, the matter was again before Johnson J in the arraignments list. Notices of motion had been filed by both accused concerning the objections taken to parts of the prosecution brief. Johnson J anticipated the difficulties that may arise given the length and complexity of the proposed voir dire and observed that jury panels had been organised for 16 February 2015. His Honour vacated the listing of the trial date and listed the pre-trial motions for 16 February 2015 with the trial to follow. No suggestion was made on 5 September 2014 that, depending upon the resolution of the objections that were to be raised on the voir dire, an application for trial by judge alone may follow the pre-trial hearing.
	
	
	The matter came before Fullerton J on 3 October 2014. Mr Stratton SC, appearing on behalf of Mr Moore, but speaking on behalf of all parties indicated that the parties “would be keen to proceed from the pre-trial applications into trial.” Her Honour confirmed the date for the pre-trial applications and enquired whether there was any possibility of using something described as “judge time” in the final months of 2014 to facilitate the smooth running of the pre-trial and trial proceedings. None of the parties were available and her Honour simply confirmed the date for the pre-trial hearing, noting that the trial would proceed after rulings on the voir dire were made. Nothing was said to suggest that the trial would be anything other than a jury trial.
	
	
	Finally, the matter came before Johnson J on 5 December 2014. On that date his Honour announced that I was to be the trial judge. Mr Stratton SC again said “could I confirm my understanding that at the moment the matter is set down for pre-trial hearings … with a view to the trial starting shortly thereafter?” Mr Young SC agreed with the proposition that the 12 week estimate may “get shorter but not longer” although he confirmed it was necessary to maintain the 12 week listing to be “a bit cautious”. However, he expressed the view that “it would be less than that”. His Honour asked the parties whether anything else needed to be raised. Nothing was.
	
	
	Arranging for the attendance of sufficient jury panels to ensure that a trial commences is a matter of some administrative and logistical difficulty. It involves summonses being sent out and significant effort on the part of the Sheriff of New South Wales. Courtrooms with appropriate facilities must be organised and scarce resources allocated accordingly. Members of the public are inconvenienced and no doubt anxious about the prospect of serving on a jury.
	
	
	For that reason, it is important when matters are mentioned before the arraignments judge that the parties provide a clear account of the issues anticipated. Where an application for a judge alone trial is contemplated, it is important for the list judge to know that. It may be that that application can be dealt with in the list court so that it is not a matter determined by the judge who may ultimately preside at such a trial.
	
	
	The purpose of s 132A(1)—and s 32(4) before it—is to avoid the appearance (or actuality) of “judge shopping”. In Perry v The Queen, Gleeson CJ said (at 594):
	


“I have no doubt that one of the legislative purposes underlying s 32(4) of the Criminal Procedure Act is concerned with an important matter of appearances. One of the reasons why the legislation provides that an election for trial without a jury must be made before the date fixed for trial is that if an election could be made on the date fixed for trial, it might appear that accused person were making such election in the light of the knowledge of the trial judge.”

   See also R v Coles at 552-553 (Wood J).


	
	In the second reading speech for the Bill introducing s 132A the Attorney General said:
	


“The new section 132A sets out procedural matters regarding trial by judge orders, including that applications are to be made no less than 28 days before the trial date, except by leave of the court. This is designed to minimise the risk of a party applying for a judge-alone trial on the basis of knowing the identity of the trial judge.”

—New South Wales Legislative Council, Courts and Crimes Legislation Further Amendment Bill 2010, Second Reading Speech (Hansard), 24 November 2010 at 28073.


	
	In the present case, there can be no suggestion of “judge shopping”. As I said earlier, the parties have known the identity of the trial Judge since 5 December 2014. That is a considerable time before the 28 day time limit prescribed by s 132A. Thus, it cannot be suggested here that the parties made the application as a result of discovering the identity of the judge.
	
	
	However, matters of appearances are not limited to the identity of the trial judge. The case has thrown up two incidents that, from the point of view of appearances, are unfortunate.
	
	
	On 3 March 2015, Senior Counsel for the accused indicated that he had instructions to make an application for a judge alone trial. He indicated that he would formally make the application by notice of motion the following day although he doubted that “it actually needs a couple of pieces of paper to galvanise the Crown into action in the circumstances”. On 4 March 2015, Senior Counsel had in his possession the formal documents but did not seek to file them until he had taken further instructions:
	


“I’m going to give my client one further opportunity to consider his position, having heard your Honour’s judgment.”


	
	This was a reference to my judgment in R v Simmons (No 2), handed down earlier in the day and in which I made certain remarks about Mr Simmons’ conduct, character and willingness to engage in criminal activity of a large variety of kinds (see for example at [142]-[149]). The appearance, if not actuality, was that Mr Simmons was basing his decision around things I had said earlier in the day. This was a perfectly sound and proper forensic exercise and an appropriate discharge of counsel professional responsibility to his client. However, as I said in the course of the argument, it was an “unedifying spectacle” from the point of view of appearances. It would not have occurred had the application for a judge alone trial been made in advance of the trial and in a timely fashion.
	
	
	The second incident involved the position taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Crown Prosecutor has taken a fair and principled approach to the application. He acknowledges that this is an unusual case in terms both of the quantity of prejudicial material and the particular manner in which that prejudicial material affects the trial. However when the application first came to be argued on 9 March 2015, I was reserved in the voir dire judgment concerning the admissions made by Mr Moore (R v Simmons (No 3)). Asked whether the Director consented to the application for trial by judge alone, the prosecutor described it as “a rather delicate situation” and continued:
	


“My instructions to oppose, and I need to quite openly inform your Honour, is predicated upon not knowing your Honour’s view in relation to the voir dire matter involving [Mr Moore’s admissions]’s.”

…

“If your Honour took a certain view, or made certain findings of fact in that matter, that it could impact on whether the Crown, the instructions for the Crown to consent or otherwise to the application for judge alone might change.”


	
	The appearance of this is that the Director was seen to be deciding whether or not to consent to an application for a judge alone trial – which is to say determining its position on the “interests of justice” – based on the identity of the trial judge. I must reiterate that I am not being critical of the Crown Prosecutor when I make these remarks. He made the submissions delicately, with admirable candour and on my invitation to speak plainly. However, once again, the appearances are bad. One problem with the matter being raised in this way, although the Crown Prosecutor was clear in eschewing it, was the appearance that some pressure may be placed on the decision maker in relation to findings to be made. (I have now delivered the judgment in Simmons (No 2) and have been advised that there will be no submission made that I should be disqualified from hearing the matter.)
	
	
	If the application for a judge alone trial was determined in advance of the pre-trial hearing, and things were said in the course of a voir dire that prompted or justified an application for the judge to disqualify themselves, that application would be dealt with on its merits. The identity of the trial judge should play no part in the determination of, or election for, a judge alone trial. Such an approach is against the purpose of the legislation and inimical to the appearance of justice.
	
	
	An application for a judge alone trial should be considered from both parties point of view without any reference to the identity of the trial judge. That is so whether the trial judge is part heard in pre-trial hearings or not. If something is said in open court or in a judgment or if information comes to the attention of the parties that might create the appearance or apprehension of bias on the part of the trial judge, the application for the judge to be disqualified from hearing the case should be made then.
	
	
	All of this goes to emphasise the problems with making an application under s 132 at such a late stage.
	
	
	In my opinion, there is much to be said for the application for a judge alone trial to be made before other pre-trial issues are considered. While this might potentially give rise to applications based around decisions then made on the voir dire, it avoids the appearances to which I have made reference.
	
	
	The tardiness of the application militates against the grant of leave under s 132A(1). However, the question of leave must also be considered by reference to a number of other significant factors.
	
	
	First, as I have said, the identity of the trial judge was known since early December 2014. The purpose of the 28 day time limit is to avoid the actuality and appearance of judge shopping. That consideration has no meaningful application where the parties were aware of the identity of the trial judge for such a long time before the trial date.
	
	
	Second, it has been put from the bar table (and I accept) that the solicitor for Mr Simmons raised the possibility of a judge alone trial informally with the prosecution at one or more of the mentions before the arraignment Judge. While the matter should have been brought to the attention of the list Judge, I take that matter into account in considering the question of leave.
	
	
	Third, rightly or wrongly, Mr Young SC took the view that the application for a judge alone trial would have been premature in advance of the ruling on the voir dire. I disagree with that stance and, even if the judge hearing the voir dire determined the sequence of applications differently, notice of the possibility of the application should have been made earlier. However I accept that Senior Counsel took a different view and did so in earnest. There was no forensic advantage in hiding the possibility that he may make an application for a judge alone trial. Further, Mr Young SC advised the court of the possibility of the application on the first day of the pre-trial hearing.
	
	
	Fourth, as Mr Stratton SC (then appearing for Mr Moore) pointed out when I raised the question of whether there was jurisdiction to hear the application after the trial had (technically) started (cf s 130(3)(a) Criminal Procedure Act), the trial date was formally vacated by the list Judge on 5 September 2013. His Honour listed the pre-trial hearing for 16 February 2015 noting that it was expected to take “several weeks”. On 5 December 2014 the list Judge confirmed the listing of the pre-trial hearing “with the trial to proceed thereafter”. The situation is not dissimilar to that which arose in R v Coles where Wood J made the following practical observations (at 553):
	


“The initial allocation of a hearing date is often a nominal date. Cases which are fixed for hearing are sometimes not reached, and cases are sometimes adjourned for cause on the date appointed for trial, either because the Crown or the accused is not ready. These cases are then re-fixed. In country circuits, and in other metropolitan courts where there are running lists, there may either be no specific date fixed, or at best the date is a nominal or not before date. When proceedings are adjourned to a new date for cause, or re-fixed after being not reached, it is difficult to say that a new date for trial has not been appointed by the trial judge, or list judge, as the case may be.

I am not prepared to construe s 32 so as to exclude the possibility of a new date for trial being fixed by the trial judge. It seems to me, as a matter of principle, that is what occurs when a matter is stood out of a daily list, and listed for a new date. I am unable to identify any satisfactory basis for framing a distinction which would be dependent on the reason for the adjournment or the re-fixing of the trial”.


	
	In view of the listing of the trial “to proceed [after]” the pre-trial hearing, any date fixed was both non-specific and “nominal” in the sense articulated by Wood J.
	
	
	Fifth, the Crown Prosecutor does not object to leave being granted. His position appeared to be (if I may be permitted to infer it) that the accused should not be locked out from arguing the merits of their application based on a refusal to grant leave due to the failure of their legal representatives to make the application earlier. This is a fair and correct approach.
	
	
	Sixth, having read the material and heard the submissions, the application is based on unusual circumstances and is clearly arguable.
	
	
	For those reasons, I will grant leave under s 132A of the Criminal Procedure Act.
	
	
	However, it should be clear to practitioners that this is a most unusual case. I expect that in most cases leave would be refused if the application is not made until after the date that the matter was set down for trial or for the hearing of pre-trial applications where the trial was to proceed thereafter.
	


The factual background, circumstances of the alleged offence and basis of the application


	
	I have set out the factual background of this case in both of my judgments on the voir dire. In Simmons (No 3) I summarised the circumstances at [7] - [11]:
	


“7. In June 2009 Andrew Russell, a resident of Bathurst, went missing. He was last seen, at least by a source that is considered by the Crown to be reliable, on 2 June 2009. His family and friends have not seen him since that date. A witness, Michael O’Neill, saw a man near the intersection of Littlebourne Street and the Sydney Road (Great Western Highway) in Kelso at around 10:30 pm and then again a short (unspecified) time later. The man was in the middle of the highway and Mr O’Neill was concerned and spoke to him. He reported the incident to Bathurst Police. A few weeks later, after Mr Russell was reported missing, Mr O’Neill was shown a photograph and said he was “quite confident” that it depicted the same man.

8. Suspicion attached fairly quickly to the accused Simmons because there was known animosity between him and Mr Russell. It is alleged (and, based on his plea on arraignment, not disputed) that on 20-21 March 2009, Simmons assaulted Mr Russell. However, while Simmons seemed to be the prime suspect, orthodox police investigations failed to uncover any cogent or admissible evidence against him. There was a good deal of rumour and some evidence of things that he had said, but no reliable evidence of real substance was uncovered between June 2009 and September 2012.

9. The accused (Moore) was a close friend and associate of Mr Simmons and the rumour mill suggested that he too was involved, either as an accomplice in the murder or in assisting with the disposal of the body.

10. Between September 2012 and January 2013, the police employed a sophisticated undercover operation targeting Simmons. The details of that operation are set out in some detail in my judgment admitting the evidence of Simmons’ admissions: R v Simmons; R v Moore (No 2) at [9]-[42]. The admissions made are detailed at [84]-[97]. In short, Simmons asserted that he and the accused had come upon Mr Russell at a bridge on the Sydney Road outside Bathurst, had taken him by car to a cliff near the town of Sofala and pushed him off the cliff. They retrieved the victim’s body and buried it in a mineshaft in another location near Sofala. Mr Simmons took the undercover police to the location where they buried the body. No mineshaft or human remains have been found in that area in spite of a thorough search. It is clear from the submissions on the voir dire that Mr Simmons’ case is that the admissions are untrue and that he was boasting or big noting himself for reasons of no present relevance.

11. The admissions made by Simmons would suggest that Mr Moore is guilty of murder. He was part of the joint enterprise of abducting Mr Russell and played a part in pushing him off the cliff. Of course, those admissions are not admissible against the accused. The Crown case against the accused Moore is that Simmons killed Mr Russell and that the accused assisted in disposing of the corpse.”


	
	In Simmons (No 2), I set out the nature and extent of the undercover police operation undertaken between September 2012 and 16 January 2013: at [9] – [42]. I set out the admissions that were made by the accused from [84] – [97]. I will not repeat that summary here and it is necessary for the reader to refer to those paragraphs to obtain any real understanding of the reasons that follow.
	
	
	In general terms, the object of the police operation was to trick the accused into believing that a number of undercover operatives [REDACTED]. The accused was encouraged to speak plainly and truthfully about crimes he had committed in the past. In particular, [REDACTED], the accused was encouraged to provide all of the circumstances surrounding the alleged murder of Mr Russell. As I said in the judgment admitting the evidence of his confessional statements, Simmons showed himself to be ready, willing and able [REDACTED]. In the lengthy recorded conversation between Simmons and the undercover police officers, Simmons admitted to being involved in a wide range of criminal offences in the past.
	
	
	In the recordings of 9, 15 and 16 December 2015 the accused made admissions to the murder of Mr Russell. To oversimplify what he said, he claimed that he and Mr Moore picked up Mr Russell at a location outside Bathurst, drove him to cliff-face at a place called Wallaby Rock near the hamlet of Sofala and pushed him from the cliff. He and Mr Moore then recovered the body and buried it in a mineshaft at another location near Sofala.
	
	
	Mr Simmons’ answer to those potentially devastating admissions will be that the confession is untrue. As I understand it, it will be suggested that he told those lies in order to big-note himself in front of people that he thought [REDACTED].
	
	
	The basis of the application for a judge alone trial is that, no matter what editing is done to the material, the nature of that material and the evidence that the accused will need to adduce in order to explain why he made admissions that he now says are false, is so prejudicial that no jury would be capable of bringing an impartial mind to bear on the ultimate issue for determination. That issue is the truthfulness and reliability of the admissions. While there is other evidence, confessional and circumstantial, upon which the Crown will place some reliance, the Crown acknowledges that the case will most likely rise and or fall on the question of the reliability of the substance, if not the detail, of the admissions. As best as it can be anticipated at the outset, the Crown’s position will be that even if the precise mechanism of the murder (i.e. pushing the victim off the cliff) is incorrect, the tribunal of fact may accept part or parts of the confession and that this may corroborate the other evidence supporting the case that Simmons is responsible for the disappearance and murder of Mr Russell. For example, there is evidence from an independent source that might establish that the location where Mr Russell was last seen alive is not far from the location where the accused admitted that he picked up Mr Russell.
	
	
	The accused submits that no direction could be formulated which would be sufficient to ensure that the jury does not act on the basis of the prejudice occasioned by the introduction of such a large body of evidence showing that the accused was a willing participant in a diverse array of serious criminal activity.
	
	
	The Director of Public Prosecutions does not consent to the order for a trial by judge alone. However, the experienced Crown Prosecutor who appears at the trial acknowledges the force of the arguments put by the accused. In particular, he concedes that the amount of prejudicial material is significant and unusual. He acknowledges that there will be real difficulties for both parties in adducing the evidence in such a way that the trial does not run the risk of miscarriage and discharge of the jury.
	
	
	However, the Crown Prosecutor took the role of “contradictor”. In doing so he relied upon the large body of authority in the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal and in the High Court to the effect that juries are generally capable of obeying directions and that the system is predicated upon the assumption that they do so.
	
	
	The Crown referred to a number of notorious cases where juries were entrusted to determine the issues in spite of the fact that the evidence necessarily showed the accused to be members of groups that are unpopular in the general community from which any jury is drawn. For example, he referred to the trial of Hawi and others involving the murder of a man at Sydney airport (the appeal is Hawi v R [2014] NSWCCA 83). That case was surrounded by great publicity of a prejudicial kind that necessarily involved the jury knowing that the members of both the groups of men who participated in a serious affray in a public aircraft terminal were members of criminal groups (outlaw motorcycle gangs). The Crown noted that the jury in that case was capable of distinguishing between the accused and a number were acquitted. He referred back to cases such as the trial following the Milperra Massacre, another trial involving so called outlaw motorcycle gangs. Again, the jury heard a substantial amount of prejudicial evidence and yet were capable of obeying directions to act in accordance with their oaths and to put aside matters of emotion and prejudice: R v Annakin (1987) 17 NSWLR 202; R v White (1988) 17 NSWLR 195.
	
	
	A less felicitous example raised by the Crown concerned the lengthy terrorist trial which proceeded before Whealy J in 2010 and was subject to a recent decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal: Elomar, Hasan, Cheikho and Jamal v R [2014] NSWCCA 303. That was an unfortunate reference because, as far as I am aware, none of the accused in the trial were acquitted and so the proposition that the jury differentiated between the cases and was not influenced by prejudice cannot be tested. In any event, it was a case tried under Commonwealth law and trial by judge alone is not available under s 80 of the Constitution: Brown v R [1986] HCA 11; 160 CLR 171.
	
	
	Otherwise, the Crown Prosecutor’s point is well made. I accept that many trials have been conducted in circumstances involving significant prejudice and juries have been capable of discernment and discretion in putting aside their emotional responses and prejudices.
	


Relevant legal principles


	
	I have set out the terms of the statute authorising a “trial by judge order”. The decision turns on a consideration of the question of whether it is in the “interests of justice” to make a trial by judge order. Obviously enough, the interests of justice is an expression of very wide import and may raise an extremely diverse array of considerations.
	


No presumption in favour of trial by jury


	
	The judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in R v Belghar [2012] NSWCCA 86; 217 A Crim R 1 represents the most comprehensive analysis of the current provisions in New South Wales. Most of the principles to be derived from the judgment were helpfully summarised by Bellew J in R v Villalon [2013] NSWSC 1516 at [20].
	
	
	In R v Belghar the Chief Judge at Common Law made reference to the analysis of the benefits of trial by jury undertaken by Heydon J in AK v Western Australia [2008] HCA 8; 232 CLR 438 at [90], [93]-[97]. Heydon J referred to Lord Devlin’s famous description of the jury as “the lamp that shows that freedom lives” and set out the five advantages that Lord Devlin identified in his Hamlyn Lectures collected in Trial by Jury (rev ed) (1966).
	
	
	McClellan CJ at CL at [96] rejected the proposition that s 131 “has the effect of creating a ‘presumption’ that the trial should be with a jury, thereby casting a burden of proof on an accused person”. His Honour acknowledged that there was an evidentiary onus but there is no presumption in favour of a jury trial and no legal onus on an accused person who seeks an order under s 132.
	


No right to a trial by judge alone but the accused’s election is to be considered


	
	In R v Stanley [2013] NSWCCA 124 Barr AJ held that “an accused cannot have a trial by judge alone for the asking”. However, the Queensland authority relied upon in support of that proposition appeared to take the view that the Criminal Code 1899 (Qld) was not “neutral” and that trials by judge alone were “exceptional”: R v Fardon [2010] QCA 317 at [81]. It is difficult to reconcile that position with the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in R v Belghar. His Honour at [96] referred to the comments in R v Fardon as obiter and rejected the proposition that the New South Wales statute required “weight to be given to the fact that, absent an application for a judge-alone trial, the trial will be with a jury”.
	
	
	However, it must be correct that the accused has no right to demand a trial by judge alone.
	
	
	On the other hand, the fact that the accused has decided on legal advice to relinquish his right to a jury trial is a matter to be weighed in determining where the interest of justice lie. Similarly, any subjective apprehension in the accused that he will not receive a fair trial in the hands of the jury is a relevant consideration: R v Belghar at [99], Arthurs v Western Australia [2007] WASC 182 at [79]. In R v Stanley it was held at [42] that there must be more than a “mere stated apprehension without supporting evidence”.
	


Community standards and intention


	
	Sub-section (5) provides some non-exhaustive guidance as to a particular circumstance where the court may decide that it is not in the interests of justice to make a trial by judge order. That circumstance is where the case raises the “application of objective community standards, including an issue of reasonableness, negligence, indecency, obscenity or dangerousness.” None of the specific matters referred to in the section will be an issue in the current trial. Nor is it anticipated that the case will give rise to any other question concerning or requiring the application of objective community standards. The questions that will arise in the present case are first whether the prosecution can establish beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Russell is deceased. That issue is starkly raised in circumstances where his remains have never been found. The Crown will rely on the fact that he has not been seen or heard of since 2 June 2009 and his disappearance is unexplained. I anticipate that Mr Russell’s poor health will be relied upon by the Crown to submit that he was unlikely to simply leave the Bathurst area and take up residence elsewhere. The Crown will also rely on the admissions made by the accused to various people including the undercover operatives. The second issue will be whether the admissions to the undercover operatives are reliable in the sense that they are true. I gather that the issue in relation to other alleged confessional statements will be whether those statements were in fact made. Those are questions of fact and do not attract the application of community standards.
	
	
	In spite of the fact that the accused disavows the issue on this application, there is some possibility that the question of intention may arise. Obviously, if it is accepted that the accused pushed the deceased off a cliff (the confession in the course of the undercover operation) the issue of intention will scarcely be arguable. There is some evidence in Ex VD 1 that the accused made admissions to bashing Mr Russell. If those admissions are accepted, or if the Crown relies on that alternative version of the admissions, it may be that the tribunal of fact would be called upon to consider whether an intention to inflict really serious injury or to kill has been established.
	
	
	There is some controversy in the cases as to whether the question of intention is a matter which raises objective community standards: see, for example, AK v Western Australia [2008] HCA 8 at [95] (Heydon J), R v Stanley [2013] NSWCCA 124 at [55]-[58] (Barr AJ, Macfarlan JA and Campbell J agreeing); R v Dean [2013] NSWSC 661 at [58] (Latham J), R v King [2013] NSWSC 448 at [52] (Bellew J), R v Abrahams [2013] NSWSC 729 at [73]-[77] (Harrison J). Both Bellew J in R v King (at [52]) and Harrison J in R v Abrahams (at [76]) referred to R v Belghar at [100] and noted that McClellan CJ at CL at [90] implicitly accepted that the question of intention did not raise the application of community standards, at least in the circumstances of that case.
	
	
	Harrison J considered the controversy in R v Abrahams and said at [73]-[77]:
	


“73. In AK v The State of Western Australia [2008] HCA 8; (2008) 232 CLR 438, Heydon J considered that the question of whether or not an accused person had a particular intent was an example of an issue requiring for its determination the application of community standards. His Honour said this at [95]:

‘...Thus Lord Devlin saw the jury as being for some purposes 'the best judicial instrument'. A clear illustration of this role of the jury is seen when the jury decides whether the facts it finds answer certain legal criteria. That phenomenon is recognised by s 118(6) of the Criminal Procedure Act, for the court may refuse to order trial by judge alone 'if it considers the trial will involve a factual issue that requires the application of objective community standards such as an issue of reasonableness, negligence, indecency, obscenity or dangerousness'. Other examples of factual issues requiring the application of 'objective community standards' include whether behaviour was 'threatening, abusive or insulting'; whether conduct was 'dishonest', a matter to be decided by the jury 'according to the ordinary standards of reasonable and honest people'; whether an assault is 'indecent'; and whether an accused person had a particular intention.’

74. The link between decisions concerning the existence or formation of a particular intent and the application of community standards was also discussed by Barr AJ in R v Stanley [2013] NSWCCA 124 at [56] - [59] with a conclusion as follows:

‘[59] I accept that the fact alone that community standards must be applied in the resolution of factual issues does not mandate trial by jury but, as subs (5) makes clear, it is a circumstance in which the jury may be considered to be the superior tribunal of fact.""

75. For my part I find it difficult immediately to accept that cases concerned with the assessment of whether or not a particular individual had formed or retained a particular intent allegedly relating to the commission of some charged act necessarily or even arguably ""involve a factual issue that requires the application of objective community standards"". The question, for example, of whether or not an act was committed with such force that it bespeaks or evinces a particular intention is undoubtedly a question of fact. The force of the suggestion that there is a corresponding and simultaneous requirement to apply some objective community standard in undertaking the assessment of that factual issue is not obvious to me. I note with some interest that the only citation provided by Heydon J for the proposition that ""whether an accused person had a particular intention"" was an example of a factual issue requiring the application of objective community standards was at note [86] to his Honour's judgment in these terms:

‘[86] Buxton, 'Some Simple Thoughts on Intention', [1988] Criminal Law Review 484 at 495: '[R]ecourse to shared values and assumptions about the implications of actions and the circumstances in which those actions occur may be a safer guide to culpability than analytical deductions from a generalised verbal definition'.’

76. In Belghar, McClellan CJ at CL expressed the view that the determination of intention in the particular circumstances of that case did not involve the application of community standards. Latham J referred to the competing views about it in R v Dean [2013] NSWSC 661 at [58] as follows:

‘[58] The Crown in King relied upon this aspect of Heydon J's judgment and the Crown relies upon it here. It is right to acknowledge that Justice Heydon's observation in this respect was not endorsed by any other member of that bench and that McClellan CJ at CL accepted that the issue of intention did not involve the application of community standards in the circumstances applying in Belghar. Like Bellew J, I am not persuaded that the issue of intention can never involve the application of objective community standards. I also note that the basis of the decision in Belghar was that the trial judge determined the application in the absence of appropriate evidence and without considering whether such prejudice as was found to exist could be neutralised by directions.’

77. Having regard to the view I have otherwise formed, it is strictly unnecessary to decide the point. I accept cautiously that it could not be said that the issue of intention could never involve the application of objective community standards. It does not, however, appear to me that this is such a case.”


	
	I agree with those observations, particularly those in paragraph [75]. There is a qualitative difference between the application of community standards to questions such as whether an act is obscene, indecent, reasonable or negligent and a factual inquiry as to whether a particular accused formed the necessary intention to constitute a specified criminal offence. Further, if the Parliament was of the view that the issue of intention was one that involved the application of community standards, it would have been very easy to include that issue within the non-exhaustive list of matters identified in sub-s 132(5).
	
	
	Neither counsel anticipates that the issue of intention will loom large in the trial. The real issue in the trial will be the whether Mr Russell was killed and, if so, who killed him. The accused says that the issue of intention is unlikely to arise in any meaningful way. Mr Young says that no submission will be made in address that the jury (or Judge sitting alone) might find the accused guilty of manslaughter on the basis that he did not have an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. The Crown Prosecutor expressed doubts that the issue will arise and it is not a matter upon which the Crown relies in opposing a trial by judge order.
	


Efficiency and the length of the trial


	
	In R v Markou [2011] NSWDC 25, Judge Berman SC noted that judge alone trials tend to be quicker and more efficient. His Honour noted:
	


“7. Even in trials that run without interruption, judge alone trials are more efficient. Advocates naturally assume that the clever points they are making regarding evidence have to be emphasised and repeated in order to ensure that the least perceptive member of the jury understands it. Not only do judges tend to understand points the first time they hear them, they have the ability to say to an advocate. ”I understood that the first time”. I use that simple example of how a judge alone trial tends to be quicker.”


	
	In R v Belghar, McClellan CJ at CL at [110] referred to these observations and similar comments in other cases. He accepted that such efficiencies and the length of the trial may form “part of the mix of issues” to be considered in a particular case but went on at [111]:
	


“111. However, I would not accept that the interests of justice in s 132 can be informed by considerations of the overall efficiencies in the operation of a court which may be available from a judge-alone trial. No doubt they are important issues for the administration of justice and may ultimately lead to further legislative intervention but, as the majority determined in Pambula Hospital v Herriman (1988) 14 NSWLR 387, they are not relevant to the interests of justice in the particular case.”


	
	An example of a case where the length of the trial was a significant part of a consideration of the “interests of justice” was R v Gittany [2013] NSWSC 1503. In that case, McCallum J accepted counsel’s estimates that the trial would have been significantly longer if conducted with a jury. The evidence was that the accused had insufficient funds to privately engage his legal team for the longer jury trial. An adjournment to allow a legal aid application to be pursued would have resulted in the unavailability of an important prosecution witness. In those circumstances, her Honour accepted that the length of the trial was a critical factor in determining whether it was in the interests of justice to make a trial by judge order.
	


The duty of a judge to provide reasons


	
	Another issue discussed in R v Belghar was the advantage of transparency inherent in the requirement that a Judge give reasons for the verdict. This is to be contrasted with the jury which is “as inscrutable as the Sphynx”: Ward v James [1966] 1 QB 273 at 301 (CA), Mackenzie v The Queen [1996] HCA 35; 190 CLR 348 at 365. McClellan CJ at CL said at [112]:
	


“To my mind the opportunity which a reasoned judgment affords to the accused and to the public to understand the steps in the reasoning process of the decision-maker, compared with the inscrutability of the jury's decision, will depending upon all the circumstances, be a factor which is relevant to the decision as to whether to order a judge-alone trial. However, it is but one factor and the weight to be given to it will depend upon the nature of the issues to be determined in the trial. If the trial will involve complex engineering, scientific or medical issues it may be more readily concluded that a verdict accompanied by the reasons of the trial judge will enhance the interests of justice, both in relation to the accused and the maintenance of confidence in the criminal justice system. It would inevitably facilitate an appeal if the trial judge has erred.”

Complex expert evidence


	
	Cases involving complex evidence that could be difficult for a jury to understand may lend themselves to orders for a trial by judge alone: R v Belghar at [112]; R v Dean at [60-62]. In Kingswell v R [1985] HCA 72; 159 CLR 264 Deane J said at 302-303:
	


“There is, for example, obvious force in the argument that a jury of ordinary men and women selected at random from the community lacks the knowledge and experience necessary to sit in responsible judgment upon the type of scientific dispute between specialists that may arise in the course of a criminal trial or upon the detailed technical questions which may be involved in the trial of white collar and computer crime.”


	
	Further, it may often be in the interests of justice for the reasoning process of the tribunal of fact to be exposed in cases involving an assessment of competing and complicated expert evidence: Arthurs v Western Australia at [90].
	


Credibility issues


	
	Lord Devlin was of the firm opinion that the jury was the most appropriate tribunal to determine issues of credibility:
	


""[T]he jury is the best instrument for deciding upon the credibility or reliability of a witness and so for determining the primary facts. Whether a person is telling the truth, when it has to be judged, as so often it has, simply from the demeanour of the witness and his manner of telling it, is a matter about which it is easy for a single mind to be fallible. The impression that a witness makes depends upon reception as well as transmission and may be affected by the idiosyncrasies of the receiving mind; the impression made upon a mind of twelve is more reliable. Moreover, the judge, who naturally by his training regards so much as simple that to the ordinary man may be difficult, may fail to make enough allowance for the behaviour of the stupid. The jury hear the witness as one who is as ignorant as they are of lawyers' ways of thought; that is the great advantage to a man of judgment by his peers.""

—Lord Devlin, Trial by Jury, (rev ed) (1966) at 14, Cited in AK v The State of Western Australia [2008] HCA 8; 232 CLR 438 at [94] and R v Belghar at [24].


	
	In Doney v The Queen [1990] HCA 51; 171 CLR 207 the High Court referred (at 214) to:
	


“...the purpose and the genius of the jury system is that it allows for the ordinary experiences of ordinary people to be brought to bear in the determination of factual matters. It is fundamental to that purpose that the jury be allowed to determine, by inference from its collective experience of ordinary affairs, whether and, in the case of conflict, what evidence is truthful.”


	
	However, it is difficult to discern a clear consensus in the Australian authorities in support of a proposition that where credibility issues are central to a trial, that is a factor that militates strongly in favour of a jury trial.
	
	
	In R v Belghar, McClellan CJ at CL referred to Lord Devlin’s statements but did not adopt them in the context of his analysis of s 132.
	
	
	In Coates v Western Australia [2009] WASCA 142 at [9]-[12] Owen JA said:
	


“9. The assessment of credibility is essentially a subjective matter, although some objective considerations might come into play in forming the platform from which the assessment is made. Section 118(6) is of no direct assistance to the appellant here. That was the view taken by the trial judge when the application was made to abort the trial (ts 3826). In my opinion his Honour was correct in coming to that conclusion.

10. It is true that a free exchange of views and ideas can be very helpful in the decision making process. Everyday experience indicates that the physical and mental process of having to articulate propositions and to listen to the reaction of others can clarify thinking. But, equally, in everyday experience important decisions are made by individuals without the benefit of interaction with others. Judges make decisions for a living and they often arise in complex circumstances and involve the expenditure of considerable intellectual effort. Assessments of credibility fall into this category. While the trial judge may be deprived of the advantage of a free interchange of ideas with peers he or she has an advantage that ordinary members may lack. Trial judges have consistent and continuing experience of fact-finding and of the making of the decisions in a situation that demands an objective and dispassionate mind.

11. I am not suggesting that juries are incapable of making objective and dispassionate decisions. A judge's charge to a jury will almost always include directions to that effect and I have no reason to believe that jury members do other than pay due and faithful regard to the instruction. But the day to day working life of a judge will often involve dealing with evidence in ways that are outside the normal experience of members of the public. For example, a judge will often be required to put to one side inadmissible evidence (of which he or she is cognisant) in assessing credibility or deciding other disputed issues. Another example is having regard to an item of evidence for one purpose and yet disregarding it in relation to another contentious issue within the same case. When matters of that nature arise in a jury trial there is a need for careful direction to guide the jury in relation to them. The experience gained by a trial judge over time in relation to a wide range of fact-finding methods can be a peculiar advantage.

12. In this case the trial judge was acutely aware of the centrality of Mr X's testimony. He expressed some views about the advantage jury members would have in discussing the evidence. If his Honour's comments are taken as an indication that he regarded himself at a material disadvantage in assessing Mr X's credibility then it will be apparent from what I have said that I do not agree. But I am not sure that this is what his Honour meant. It does not follow that just because one group has an advantage that another group (or individual) has a material disadvantage in relation to the same matter.”


	
	Those observations were made after the trial Judge had referred to the passage from Doney v The Queen set out above at [74] and went on:
	


“When 12 people unanimously agree on the credibility of a critical witness there can be the highest degree of confidence that that assessment is correct. However, in a trial without a jury only one person makes that assessment, and in my view it follows that exceptional care must be taken before accepting an accomplice's evidence.”


	
	Buss JA (with whom Martin CJ agreed) said at [118]:
	


“118. In my respectful opinion, the learned trial judge overstated any difficulty for a trial judge (and his Honour is a very experienced trial judge) in determining the credibility of a witness. The assessment of the truthfulness and reliability of witnesses is a basic function of a trial judge and, in performing that task, he or she is not, in my opinion, under any relevant disadvantage compared with a jury. Indeed, a trial judge has considerable advantages over a jury as a result of his or her training and experience.”


	
	In R v Farrow [2014] NSWSC 1781 Rothman J made a trial by judge order in a case where the sole issue was mental illness. There was a conflict of expert opinion. Central to that conflict was the question of whether the accused was “genuine in his statement of symptoms”. Rothman J acknowledged (at [37]) that this was a matter “invariably” considered by juries and not a matter that “peculiarly, or even preferably, should be determined by the trial judge.” In spite of that fact, and the fact that the issues “may require the application of objective community standards”, his Honour was persuaded that it was in the interests of justice for the matter to be determined by judge alone.
	
	
	There may be cases where particular issues of credibility mean that the interests of justice favour a trial by jury. In R v Tasich [2012] NSWDC 96 Knox DCJ expressed the opinion that where there were attacks on the credibility of public officials and members of parliament “it is an important matter for the administration of justice that the truth or otherwise of such purported attacks need to be determined in open court by the community as represented by the jury.”
	
	
	I allow for the possibility that there are cases where such an approach may be correct. However, for the most part, the fact that a trial involves issues of credibility is a neutral matter when it comes to determining whether it is in the interests of justice to make an order for trial by judge alone. As was stressed in R v Belghar and Coates v Western Australia, each mode of trial has its advantages and disadvantages, strengths and weaknesses. While a jury has the advantage of being able to discuss the issues and the requirement for unanimity provides strength to its decision, a judge has the training and experience of making difficult decisions on question of credibility, putting aside matters of emotion, on an almost daily basis.
	


Prejudicial material


	
	Jodie O’Leary suggests that the most common reason for seeking a judge alone trial is a belief in the accused “that his or her trial might otherwise be prejudiced by previous media publicity or by evidence which the jury might find revolting”: Jodie O’Leary, “Twelve angry peers or one angry judge: An analysis of judge lone trials in Australia” (2011) 35(3) Criminal Law Journal 154. O’Leary considered cases across Australia, particular in Western Australia, Queensland and New South Wales.
	
	
	There are a number of cases in New South Wales where applications for trial by judge alone have been based on prejudice arising from material contained in the evidence of the case itself, from the media publicity surrounding the proceedings or from the risk that a jury may interrogate the internet. Overwhelmingly, it has held that the prejudice identified in the application is capable of being overcome by direction to the jury: see, for example, R v Abrahams at [54]-[60], R v Dean at [65], R v King at [60]-[65]; R v McKnight [2014] NSWSC 398 at [31] (Campbell J).
	
	
	In R v King, Bellew J cited some of the more influential statements to the effect that a jury is capable of following directions imploring them to disregard matters of emotion and prejudice:
	


“62. Bearing all of these matters in mind there is, as the Crown pointed out, a long line of authority which unequivocally supports the proposition that it is to be assumed that jurors will follow directions which are given to them by a trial judge. In Gilbert v R (2000) 201 CLR 414 McHugh J explained the proposition in this way (at 425):

‘The criminal trial on indictment proceeds on the assumption that jurors are true to their oath, that, in the quaint words of the ancient oath, they hearken to the evidence and that they obey the trial judge's directions. On that assumption, which I regard as fundamental to the criminal jury trial, the Common Law countries have staked a great deal. If it was rejected or disregarded, no one - accused, trial judge or member of the public - could have any confidence in any verdict of a criminal jury or in the criminal justice system whenever it involves the jury trial. If it was rejected or disregarded, the pursuit of justice through the jury system would be as much a charade as the show trial of any totalitarian state. Put bluntly, unless we act on the assumption that criminal juries act on the evidence and in accordance with the directions of the trial judge, there is no point in having a criminal jury trial...In my respectful opinion, the fundamental assumption of the criminal jury trial requires us to proceed on the basis that the jury acted in this case on the evidence and in accordance with the judge's directions and that they would have done so even if manslaughter had been left as an issue, as it should have been left.’

63. Observations to a similar effect had previously been expressed by Mason CJ and Toohey J in R v Glennon [1992] HCA 16; 173 CLR 592 (at 603):

‘The possibility that a juror might acquire irrelevant and prejudicial information is inherent in a criminal trial. The law acknowledges the existence of that possibility but proceeds on the footing that the jury, acting in conformity with the instructions given to them by the trial judge, will render a true verdict in accordance with the evidence. As Toohey J. observed in Hinch v Attorney General (Vic) [1987] HCA 56; (1987) 164 CLR 15, at p 74, in the past too little weight may have been given to the capacity of jurors to assess critically what they see and hear and their ability to reach their decisions by reference to the evidence before them. In Murphy v R [1989] HCA 28; 167 CLR 94, we stated at p 99:

‘But it is misleading to think that, because a juror hasheard something of the circumstances giving rise to thetrial, the accused has lost the opportunity of anindifferent jury. The matter was put this way by theOntario Court of Appeal in Reg. v. Hubbert (1975) 29 CCC (2d) 279, at p 291: 'In this era of rapid dissemination of news by the various media, it would be naive to think that in the case of a crime involving considerable notoriety, it would be possible to select 12 jurors who had not heard anything about the case. Prior information about a case, and even the holding of a tentative opinion about it, does not make partial a juror sworn to render a true verdict according to the evidence'.

To conclude otherwise is to underrate the integrity of the system of trial by jury and the effect on the jury of the instructions given by the trial judge.’

64. The statements in Glennon were expressly adopted by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Lodhi v R [2007] NSWCCA 360; (2007) 179 A Crim R 470 at [153] per Barr J (Spigelman CJ and Price J agreeing).”


	
	There are many statements to similar effect. It is assumed that a jury will generally act on the instructions that it is given: Gilbert v The Queen [2000] HCA 15; 201 CLR 414 at 425 (McHugh J).
	
	
	Academic writers have questioned this “near heroic belief that jury directions can cure negative impressions formed about an accused” and suggested that “there is no evidence to suggest that this is anything other than judicial wishful thinking”: see Mirko Bagaric, “The community interest in bringing suspects to trial trumps the right to an impartial decision maker – at least in Victoria” (2010) 34(1) Criminal Law Journal 5 at 8. Bagaric refers to a “body of work that suggest that once people form an adverse view they cannot simply discard their preconceptions upon command” (see footnote 4 on p 8) and asserts that “the overwhelming trend of results is that notorious accused are convicted”.
	
	
	In spite of the persuasiveness of Bagaric’s essay, the force of the authorities are such that I must proceed on the basis that jurors are capable of, and do, obey directions, including directions requiring them to disregard prejudicial publicity surrounding a trial and prejudicial evidence adduced in the course of the trial. However, this axiom can be taken only so far. The discretions residing in a trial judge to exclude prejudicial evidence, to suppress evidence during the currency of a trial, to discharge a jury without verdict if inadmissible evidence comes before it and to order separate trials of co-accused and severance of multiple counts are all examples of legal remedies which would not exist if it were universally the case that juries were capable of obeying directions and disregarding prejudicial material. It is a question of degree and turns on a thorough analysis of both the nature and extent of the prejudicial material and the method by which it will be introduced into the trial.
	
	
	This was recognised by Judge Woods QC in R v GSR (3) [2011] NSWDC 17. That case is best identified by reference to the nickname given to the accused by various media outlets. The accused became widely known as the “Butcher of Bega”. He had been tried and convicted in relation to an offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent. The trial attracted an enormous amount of media publicity. He was then called for trial in relation to a number of offences of indecent assault. Woods QC DCJ held that the publicity was so great and so prejudicial that a fair trial before a jury could not be held at that time. Accordingly, his Honour made an order under s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act and the case proceeded by judge alone trial. R v GSR (No 3) is an example of an exception to both the body of case law that the system is predicated on the fact that juries obey the directions that they are given and also the general proposition that juries are capable of disregarding prejudicial material.
	
	
	Similarly, in Arthurs v Western Australia, Martin CJ was persuaded that he should order a trial by judge alone largely as a consequence of pre-trial publicity that his Honour described at [86] as “extensive, continuous and in some respects extraordinary”. The Chief Justice had earlier found at [31] that some of the publicity arguably constituted a contempt of court. In concluding that the interests of justice favoured a trial by judge without a jury his Honour said at [87]-[92]:
	


“87. There are of course many cases dealing with the extent to which prejudice that might be occasioned by pre-trial publicity can be ameliorated by an appropriate warning and direction to the jury, and it is standard practice in Western Australia to direct juries that they should not make any access to the Internet to conduct any of their own inquiries in relation to any aspect of the case before them. However, there is, I think, room for doubt as to the efficacy of these processes, particularly in cases which have achieved the notoriety of this case. So in my opinion there is some weight in the proposition that there is a prospect that the fairness of Mr Arthurs' trial might be prejudiced by the extensive publicity to which I have referred if he is tried by a jury.

88. The second factor which I take into account is the possible effect which the evidence as to the circumstances of the offence might have upon a jury. As I mentioned earlier, it is, I think, neither necessary nor appropriate for me to detail those circumstances other than to observe that the evidence is likely to test the emotional strength and fortitude of any person required to consider it in detail, whether juror or Judge.

89. Despite their training and experience, it would, I think, be unwise to assume that Judges are any less vulnerable to human emotions and frailty than any other member of the community. However, it is in this context that an obligation to provide reasons appears to me to be of particular significance. Through the performance of that obligation, the accused person, the community and where necessary an appeal court can evaluate whether, and if so the extent to which emotion may have influenced the decision, at least to a greater extent than in the case of a jury verdict. That consideration seems to me to lend weighty support in this case to the proposition that trial by Judge without jury is in the interests of justice.

90. A third factor which I take into account is allied to the second in that it draws upon the significance of the obligation to provide reasons in the event of a trial by Judge without jury. While it could not be said that the complexity and length of this trial is such that it would be burdensome on a jury, there are more than 70 prosecution witnesses named on the indictment, although we do not yet know how many of those witnesses are to be called. The latest estimate as to the length of trial I have received is one of ten days.

91. I am, however, told by defence counsel that there are likely to be issues requiring the detailed evaluation of expert evidence, including expert pathological and psychiatric evidence. I accept though that it is difficult to be certain as to precisely the extent of that evidence at this stage.

92. I do not for one moment suggest that those are issues which are beyond the capacity of a jury and although this is not a factor upon which I would place considerable weight, from my review of the prosecution brief there do appear to be aspects of this case in respect of which the delivery of reasoned decisions for judgment would be in the interests of justice.”


	
	O’Leary noted (at p 22) that the cases reviewed for her paper predominantly concerned issues relating to prejudice arising from publicity surrounding the case. She considered that the distinction in Arthurs v Western Australia may have been that much of the prejudicial material was evidence to be led at the trial. Such material often concerns the horrific nature of the offence itself. As Latham J’s judgment in R v Dean shows, it is generally accepted (although it cannot universally be true) that prejudice of that kind can be cured by direction. Dean was charged with 11 counts of murder arising from a fire he set at a nursing home. Latham J said at [65]:
	


“65. Unfortunately, trials for multiple murders are not unknown to the administration of criminal justice. Notorious trials such as that relating to the murder of 7 young tourists by Ivan Milat (R v Milat NSWCCA 26 February 1998) in circumstances far more heinous than the instant case have been conducted before a jury. It is accepted by the common law that juries follow instructions from the trial judge that impress upon them the importance of deciding the matter on the evidence in the trial and putting to one side any emotional responses they may have. Robust and repeated instructions to the jury panel that invite any prospective juror to disqualify himself or herself from the panel if unable to put prejudices aside are capable of markedly reducing the risk of bias.”


	
	The application in the present case is not based on prejudicial publicity or on the horrific nature of the evidence to be adduced in relation to the alleged murder itself. Rather, the application is based on the prejudice that will be occasioned by the introduction of evidence that the accused [REDACTED]. In that sense, the case is rather unusual. The case of Donai v R [2011] NSWCCA 173, to which reference was made in Simmons (No 2) at [152], provided an example where similar evidence (led without objection) caused the trial to miscarry and a jury verdict to be set aside.
	


Application of those principles to the present case

Prejudicial material to be adduced at trial


	
	As the judgment in R v Simmons; R v Moore (No 2) shows, there is a vast amount of material in the brief relating to Mr Simmons which is of a highly prejudicial kind. This was summarised in my earlier judgment in dot point form in paragraph [142] – [149]:
	


“142. The material tendered on the voir dire contains a vast amount of material which, if admitted before a jury, would give rise to enormous prejudice to the accused’s right and capacity to receive a fair trial. That material comes in a variety of forms. First, there is the participation by the accused [REDACTED] in the course of the covert police operation. Secondly, in the course of the conversations with the undercover officers, the accused made many admissions (or boasts) about his past involvement in a variety of criminal offences. Third, the tenor of much of the conversation is offensive and suggestive of a person of bad character.

143. I note that the accused have indicated (“formally” yesterday) that they intend to seek leave under s 132A Criminal Procedure Act to make an application for Judge alone trial under s 132. The Crown is yet to indicate its position on the application and the question of leave is a live one. The application is yet to be dealt with and it is appropriate to deal with the s 137 submission on the basis that the trial will be by jury.

144. As my summary of the scenario evidence shows, the police enticed the accused into the commission of a wide variety of pretend criminal offences. His willingness to involve himself in these crimes does him no credit and is likely to cause a jury to consider him to be a person of bad character with a propensity towards the commission of a vast array of offences. Without being exhaustive, the malfeasance and criminal behaviour in which the accused was prepared to participate included:–

- [REDACTED]

- [REDACTED]

- [REDACTED]

- [REDACTED]

- [REDACTED]

- [REDACTED]

- [REDACTED]

- [REDACTED]

- [REDACTED]

- [REDACTED]

- [REDACTED]

- [REDACTED]

- [REDACTED]”


	
	However in the course of submissions, the Crown Prosecutor indicated that he did not need to rely upon a large number of the earlier conversations recorded by listening device between September 2012 and early January 2013. The critical material was that contained in the conversations of 9 January 2013, and 15 – 16 January 2013.
	
	
	The Crown will not press for or seek to tender that earlier material. Presumably the facts of the police operation and its general nature will be given in oral testimony by the relevant offices but the highly prejudicial listening device recordings will not be played and not all of the details of the [REDACTED] criminal offences in which the accused was encouraged to participate would be placed before the jury.
	
	
	The remaining material, which is to say the recordings on 9, 15 and 16 January 2013, still contain evidence of a highly prejudicial nature. It shows the accused’s willingness to engage in [REDACTED]. It was by introducing that “scenario” that the police were able, after a lengthy and sophisticated undercover investigation, to extract the confession or confessions that they did. That material cannot be extricated from the factual matrix to be played out before the jury.
	
	
	Further, within the conversations themselves there are a number of occasions when the accused refers to other crimes that he may have been involved in as well as other material that shows him in a very bad light. While the Crown does not press for the tender of all of that material, it is inevitable that some of it will come out in the trial. It is likely that the accused would seek to rely on the things he said in support of his defence that he was big-noting himself in front of the people [REDACTED].
	
	
	In Simmons (No 2) I referred in general terms to the nature and extent of the prejudicial material that would remain even taking into account the Crown’s agreement not to adduce all of the earlier recordings and assuming a large amount of editing of the evidence:
	


“154. However, if the admissions (or some of them) are admitted, it will still be necessary for the jury to be aware that that the underlying theme of the covert operation was that the UCOs [REDACTED]. In addition to that, the conversations containing the admissions are riddled with comments that suggest that the accused is callous and uncaring. By way of example, the comment about robbing the victim after he was dead and that he was a ‘bum’. Also, he made disparaging remarks about the possibly deceased UCO 2.

155. This means that, in spite of the concession by the Crown to extract large portions of the material, there will remain a real danger of unfair prejudice.

156. Further, if the admissions go before the jury, the accused will need to make difficult forensic choices in relation to what parts of the evidence he requires to ensure that the jury understands his defence. I expect that the defence will be that the things he said to the police were unreliable, untrue and the result of him big noting himself [REDACTED]. To establish this he will have to cross-examine his way through a minefield of potentially prejudicial material. Again, this creates a danger of unfair prejudice.”


	
	Simmons (No 2) included a direction that the parties liaise in an effort to reach agreement as to the form and content of the remaining parts of the evidence recorded by surveillance device. That was a substantial undertaking but on Wednesday 18 March 2015 the parties advised me of the prejudicial material that they agree needs to be led to enable (i) the Crown to put the evidence of the crucial admissions fairly and comprehensibly before the jury and (ii) the defence to mount its contention that the admissions are unreliable.
	
	
	Ex VD 17 is a list of the material to be edited from the listening device recordings of 9, 15 and 16 January 2013. Ex VD 18 is a summary of the prejudicial material that, by agreement between the parties, will remain. It includes reference to [REDACTED]. It also includes reference to offences previously committed by the accused including drug supply. Perhaps most significantly for present purposes, it includes reference to the “scenario” [REDACTED]: see Simmons (No 2) at [32]-[37]. The accused was active in this enterprise. [REDACTED].
	
	
	Ex VD 16 is a schedule of material from the recordings between September 2012 and early January 2013 that the accused may seek to elicit in order to put into a realistic and true context his case that his admissions were boasts [REDACTED]. The scenarios are set out in Simmons (No 2) and encompass a wide range of criminal and anti-social behaviour.
	


Affidavit evidence


	
	The accused relies on two affidavits of his solicitor. The first affidavit refers to the fact that the Crown will rely on evidence of an earlier assault by the accused on Mr Russell as “motive or relationship evidence”. It also says that many of the civilian witnesses know the accused through their mutual involvement in criminal and drug related activity. It is asserted that the nature of these relationships “involves the danger of inadvertent disclosure of criminal behaviour during their evidence”. The affidavit annexes the accused’s election for a judge alone trial. The election was made after receiving the advice of his solicitor and Senior Counsel. The affidavit also refers to body of evidence to which I have already referred.
	
	
	The second affidavit identifies further areas of prejudice and lists a number of witnesses known to the accused through criminal connections, drug related activity or as a result of meeting the accused in gaol. Reliance on much of this material was abandoned in the course of argument when it became clear that the Crown did not propose to rely on the material or would not adduce any evidence of criminal connection between the accused and the witnesses.
	
	
	I accept that the material in the affidavits provides some basis for concerns that inadmissible and prejudicial evidence may inadvertently be adduced in the trial. However, of itself, this is a matter that can be dealt with by caution on the part of the advocates and, if necessary, clear direction to the jury.
	


The Crown Prosecutor’s position


	
	The Crown Prosecutor is instructed to oppose the application for judge alone trial. However, in so doing he acknowledges “I can fairly say there are merits in the application … it’s not just a wish-list type of application” (T 389). Later he indicated that “given the state of the [DPP] Guidelines, I’m not in a position to consent” but went on “I concede there a significantly good reasons for the application being made by both accused” (T 416).
	
	
	As I have set out above, the Crown went on to make cogent submissions based around a jury’s ability to follow directions that require them to put aside matters of prejudice and emotion.
	


Relevant considerations


	
	I turn then to summarise my reasoning and application of the principles of law to the facts of the present case. In doing so, I will repeat in summary form some of the principles of law that guide me and to which I have already made reference.
	
	
	There is no presumption in favour of a jury trial and there is no onus on the accused to establish that it is in the interests of justice for the trial to be conducted by judge alone.
	
	
	This is not a case where the application of community standards will be a factor. While a question of intention may arise and while some of the authorities suggest that intention might involve the application of such standards, I am not persuaded by those authorities and accept the submission of counsel that this is not a case where intention is the central issue.
	
	
	Questions of credibility of the witnesses will inevitably arise and the Crown has identified a number of witnesses whose credibility will be subject to dispute. However, for the reasons I have articulated, I am of the opinion that this is a neutral consideration.
	
	
	This is not a case involving complex expert opinion evidence or where the Judge’s duty to give reasons is of particular significance. If a jury were to return a verdict of guilty, it would clearly be on the basis that it accepted relevant parts of the accused admissions. The accused would not be benefited or enlightened by a statement of reasons.
	
	
	I do not consider the length of the trial to be a matter of any significance in the present case. I accept that a judge alone trial is likely to be somewhat more efficient but, judging from the length of the voir dire, I doubt that the savings of court time would be particularly large. In any event, with one reservation, I do not consider such matters constitute a relevant consideration in the circumstances of this case. The reservation is that there is a real risk that if the jury is empanelled there will be repeated applications for discharge of the jury as the material comes out. Some of those applications are likely to have some merit. If acceded to, there will be an increase in court time, expense and inconvenience to witnesses. If refused, it may give rise to grounds of appeal.
	
	
	The accused’s election to be tried by judge alone is a matter worthy of some weight. I infer from his election that he is concerned that the nature of the prejudicial material may impact on him receiving a fair trial in front of a jury. The affidavit evidence satisfies me that he has sought and received advice from an Australian legal practitioner as to the effect of a “trial by judge order”: s 132(6).
	
	
	I commence my consideration of the question of the prejudicial material by acknowledging the large body of authority supporting the proposition that juries will obey the directions of the trial judge and are capable of putting to one side material giving rise to prejudice.
	
	
	I also acknowledge the fair and reasonable stance adopted by the Crown Prosecutor. While the Crown did not have instructions to consent to a judge alone trial, he candidly acknowledged the difficulties that both parties would encounter in conducting the trial in the light of the nature and extent of the prejudicial material lurking in the brief.
	
	
	I have not been taken to any case where the prejudice is as extensive as it appears to be in this case. Further, apart from the sheer volume of prejudicial material, the real vice in the present case is the way in which the evidence will be introduced, the fact that it raises both character and tendency in circumstances where the Crown places no reliance on it for those purposes and, perhaps most potently, the fact that the accused’s counsel may need to introduce certain parts of the material in order properly to argue his client’s defence. As I have said, that defence is no doubt that [REDACTED]. That is a most unpalatable defence and one that will be entirely foreign to most members of the jury. I find it difficult to see how the accused can fairly conduct that defence and expect a jury of right minded people from the community to put aside his admitted criminal propensity in determining in a cold, scientific, dispassionate and judicial manner whether the Crown has proved its case of murder beyond a reasonable doubt.
	
	
	I am unable to envisage any direction to the jury that will alleviate the prejudice that will be aroused by the material that it is anticipated will be led in this trial. In Makarov v R (No 3) [2008] NSWCCA 293 a large body of prejudicial evidence was tendered as “context” or “relationship” evidence. The Court (Bell JA, Johnson and McCallum JJ) held that the careful and thorough directions given in that case were “not capable of overcoming the prejudice that arose as a result of the joint trial and the admission of the appellant’s other sexual misconduct”. While the factual and legal matrix is entirely different, the cases share two common threads. The first is the sheer volume of prejudicial material that will be introduced into the trial and the fact that the material is not introduced in direct proof of guilt but for an ancillary purpose. The second is that direction to the jury is unlikely to overcome the prejudice that will result in the admission of such a large body of evidence.
	


Conclusion and Orders


	
	Taking all of those matters into account, I have reached the conclusion that it is in the interests of justice that the accused be tried by judge alone.
	
	
	I make the following orders:
	



	
	Leave granted under s 132A Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW).
	
	
	Pursuant to s 132 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) I order that the accused is to be tried by judge sitting alone without a jury.
	
	
	The un-redacted version of this judgment is to be available to judicial officers, their staff and legal practitioners as a restricted judgment on the Judicial Information Research System (JIRS) in accordance with the protocols established by the Judicial Commission.

2767373,Williamson v Carneys Lawyers [2015] NSWSC 1080,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	Hugh Williamson, the plaintiff, seeks damages against the first and third defendants for alleged negligence and breach of retainer, as well as for breaches of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (now repealed) (in respect of the first defendant, Carneys Lawyers (Carneys)) and the Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW) (in respect of the third defendant, Mr Meakes). The plaintiff also sought relief against Rabobank Australia Limited (Rabobank), the second defendant, but this aspect of the proceedings has been resolved. Accordingly, a reference in these reasons to “the defendants” is a reference to Carneys and Mr Meakes.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s claim is based on the allegation that Mr Meakes failed to advise him to make his own inquiries relating to activities on land in the vicinity of a rural property known as Reevesdale which he purchased in July 2007. The plaintiff contended that, had he known that a quarry development was proposed on the property next to Reevesdale, he would not have purchased it. He claims damages on the basis of the loss of value of Reevesdale (which was eventually sold in May 2013 for $805,000); the loss of value of his terrace in Paddington (which he alleges he would have sold in 2007 at a higher price but for the defendants’ negligence) and various consequential losses.
	
	
	The defendants defended the proceedings on various bases, including: that Mr Meakes did in fact advise the plaintiff to make his own inquiries about the surrounding properties; that the vendor’s real estate agent, Les Hannan, had already told him about the residents’ protest against the proposed quarry development; and that, even if such inquiries had been made, the plaintiff would still have purchased Reevesdale. The defendants also contested the calculation of damages and relied on the principle in Potts v Miller (1940) 64 CLR 282.
	


The Facts


	
	The plaintiff was a solicitor who practised principally in commercial law and litigation, both in partnership and on his own account, since he commenced his articles in the United Kingdom in 1983. He continued to practise after migrating to Australia in 1990. In 1994 the plaintiff engaged Stephen Fitzsimons as his personal accountant. Mr Fitzsimons has acted in that role ever since.
	
	
	In 2001, the plaintiff was instructed by Michael Thomson to bring proceedings for damages for unfair dismissal, against his former employer, Societe Generale (the Thomson matter). The matter continued for several years and occupied a substantial part of the plaintiff’s professional practice as a solicitor.
	
	
	On 10 January 2005 CEAL Ltd (CEAL), trading as Multiquip Quarries, lodged a development application for the construction of a quarry (the quarry development) at Ardmore Park, Bungonia, near Goulburn. Ardmore Park was adjacent to Reevesdale. On 2 August 2005 the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning refused the development application in respect of the quarry development. On 29 March 2006 CEAL appealed against the refusal.
	
	
	On 24 March 2006 judgment was delivered in the Thomson matter. The result was adverse to Mr Thomson, who instructed the plaintiff to file an appeal on his behalf to a full bench of the Industrial Relations Court. As the appeal resulted in a delay in the conclusion of the matter, the plaintiff and Mr Thomson negotiated a new basis for the plaintiff’s professional fees for acting on the matter.
	
	
	To that end, in May 2006, the plaintiff drafted a deed (without obtaining legal advice himself), which he and Mr Thomson executed on 24 May 2006, which provided for the payment of professional fees. In the deed, Mr Thomson acknowledged that he owed the plaintiff $2.475m, including GST, for fees from August 2001 to March 2006; agreed to pay the plaintiff $40,000 on account of costs by 2 July 2006; and agreed to pay a percentage of the net balance (a sliding scale, commencing at 27.5% and increasing to 32.5% for amounts over $2m) of any judgment or settlement sum obtained by Mr Thomson as a result of the proceedings.
	
	
	I understood the plaintiff to admit in his evidence in the present proceedings that he knew that the deed was unenforceable by reason of the prohibition in the Legal Profession Act 2004 (NSW) (now repealed) against lawyers charging fees by reference to a portion of the amount recovered. He said that he believed that he would be entitled to make a quantum meruit claim against Mr Thomson for the legal work he had performed for him and sought to justify his entry into the deed by saying that Mr Thomson insisted that he would only be paid on those terms. I do not accept the plaintiff’s explanation.
	
	
	At some time prior to August 2006, Reevesdale was offered for sale by Elders Real Estate and was passed in at auction. Mr Hannan, who commenced employment at Elders Real Estate in Goulburn in August 2006, inspected the property and subsequently became the real estate agent for the vendor.
	
	
	Mr Hannan’s opinion was that Reevesdale was proving difficult to sell at a price acceptable to the vendor because the price was too high; the buildings on the property were Georgian and required costly upkeep; local residents preferred newer improvements; and its area was only 250 acres which was substantially less than was required to conduct a commercially self-sustaining farming business. Mr Hannan considered that the property might appeal to wealthy person as a weekender, but would be unlikely to appeal to a farmer. These matters led Elders Real Estate to enter into a joint agreement to market Reevesdale with Cassim Real Estate in Woollahra, Sydney.
	
	
	From time to time, in his role as the vendor’s agent, Mr Hannan travelled to Reevesdale along the Mountain Ash Road from Goulburn via Bungonia. He noticed that there were various placards tied to fences and trees near Bungonia on which was handwriting of a sufficient size to be legible from the road. The placards contained various messages, including “STOP THE QUARRY”; ‘NO QUARRY”; and “NO TRUCKS THROUGH BUNGONIA”.
	
	
	In 2007 the plaintiff was having financial difficulties. His principal lender, the National Australia Bank Ltd (the NAB), refused to increase his indebtedness beyond $1m. His sole security property was a terrace in Cascade Street, Paddington, where he lived with his wife and family. The fees he believed he was owed from the Thomson matter were disputed and were not, in any event, payable until the conclusion of the matter. He had an urgent need for cash and no apparent way of remedying the situation unless he could obtain further cash by refinancing his debt.
	
	
	In March 2007 the plaintiff saw an advertisement for Reevesdale in the Sydney Morning Herald. He contacted Michael Cassim, from Cassim Real Estate. Bill Bridges, another agent at Cassim Real Estate, rang Mr Hannan and asked him to call the plaintiff to arrange an inspection of Reevesdale.
	
	
	The plaintiff ascertained that Reevesdale had been passed in at auction for $2.2m in 2006. He believed that if he could acquire Reevesdale for $1.8m, he would have immediate equity of some hundreds of thousands of dollars, against which he could increase his borrowings. Moreover, he believed that he could transfer all of the debt, with which his Paddington terrace was charged, to Reevesdale, and thereby convert all interest payments into tax deductible expenses.
	
	
	The plaintiff accepted in cross-examination that Reevesdale was a “trophy property” in that it was aesthetically pleasing and had an historic Georgian house located on it, where the plaintiff intended to spend time with his family on weekends and on vacation.
	
	
	The plaintiff’s plan was, accordingly, to safeguard his financial future by substantially increasing his borrowings on a property, the income from which would be significantly less than the interest cost of the debt. Although it might be thought that the plaintiff could have sold his Paddington terrace to increase the availability of cash, he was reluctant to take this course, at least in part because it was where he lived with his new wife and young children (at least one of whom attended a school within walking distance) and also because he believed that there was significant development potential associated with the terrace which he wanted to be in a position to realise in due course.
	
	
	On 3 May 2007, the hearing of CEAL’s appeal against the Council’s refusal of the development application in respect of the quarry development began. Jagot J heard the appeal on 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 14, 15 and 16 May 2007. At the conclusion of the hearing her Honour reserved her decision.
	
	
	Also during May 2007 the plaintiff arranged to inspect Reevesdale with Mr Hannan. The plaintiff and his wife drove from her parents’ property in Hay to Goulburn and then took the Mountain Ash Road to Bungonia Village where they parked the Porsche in which they had made the journey and got into Mr Hannan’s car (which was more suitable for the unsealed road that lay ahead) in which they were driven to Reevesdale. En route, the plaintiff saw placards posted on the side of the road which referred to a quarry. He asked Mr Hannan about them. Mr Hannan told him that he did not know much about it but that he would find out and get back to him.
	
	
	As soon as the plaintiff saw Reevesdale he “fell in love with it” and wanted to make it his own. The plaintiff asked Mr Hannan about the property, including its carrying capacity.
	
	
	After the visit, Mr Hannan visited a residence on Mountain Ash Road from which one of the placards was displayed. He was told by the owner that the placards had been erected in protest against a proposed quarry on Oallen Ford Road which would bring about a substantial increase in traffic on local roads, cause structural damage to local heritage buildings and result in nuisance associated with dust and noise. He also told Mr Hannan that there were legal proceedings in the Land and Environment Court over the development application.
	
	
	Mr Hannan rang the plaintiff and relayed the substance of the conversation. When Mr Hannan mentioned the Land and Environment Court, the plaintiff told him that he knew where it was and that he would make some enquiries.
	
	
	For reasons given below where I address the credibility of witnesses and the Jones v Dunkel inference (named after the eponymous case, (1959) 101 CLR 298), I accept Mr Hannan’s evidence (and reject the plaintiff’s denials) that there were placards on the side of the road; that they had a conversation to this effect; and that Mr Hannan reported to him the results of his inquiry about the significance of the placards.
	
	
	In late May 2007, after he had visited Reevesdale, the plaintiff applied to Rabobank for finance. Because the plaintiff’s plan was tax-driven, he was anxious to complete the sale before 30 June 2007. Chris Twyford, a rural manager at Rabobank, sent the plaintiff a letter dated 24 May 2007 to which indicative terms for a loan of $2.75m (being $1.8m for Reevesdale and $950,000 to refinance the Paddington facility) were attached.
	
	
	The plaintiff responded to Mr Twyford by email dated of 28 May 2007 in which he said, in part:
	


“I certainly wish to proceed and your indicative offer was gratefully received and helps with the negotiation.

Assuming I do go ahead (which looks highly likely) I will move my business to Rabo from NAB.

. . .

You will be interested to know that 8 months ago the property, Reevesdale, was passed in with a highest bid of $2.5m. You can confirm that with Les Hannan at Elders in Goulburn. The vendor has since regretted his bullish expectations but has retained price expectations at $1.9m . . . .

As soon as there is a price agreement on Reevesdale and I have a valuation on Paddington I will let you know. Obviously I will need to move very quickly after that.”


	
	On 31 May 2007 the plaintiff filled in a loan application with Rabobank in which he sought a total amount of $3.025m. In an email sent on the same day to Mr Twyford, he described Reevesdale as a “marvellous bargain” at $1.65m. In the email the plaintiff identified two sources of income which he expected to enhance his cash flow over the next two years: first, his claim against Mr Debney, a former partner; and second, the costs associated with the Thomson matter referred to above.
	
	
	The plaintiff reported to Mr Twyford in his email of 31 May 2007 the following with respect to the Thomson matter:
	


“We won the case but the Judge wrote a judgment with a dreadful flaw and gave them in effect what they were seeking by depressing the amount of revenues.

…

The judgment has been appealed. There is no doubt that the appeal will be successful because of the black and white nature of the matter and the fact that the judge was clearly wrong . . .

The appeal is to be heard by the full bench of the Industrial Relations Court of New South Wales on 14 and 15 November 2007. Since there is no appeal from a decision of that Full Bench the litigation will be finished.

I have a right to be paid after that. I will attach to a confidential fax extracts from the deed under which I am to be paid. They are edited to maintain confidentiality.

The appeal result will increase the current judgment amount of $2.5m to c. $6.5m (incl interest) + costs in the region of $1.5m.

That will mean that I receive under clause 5.1 $400,000, under clause 5.2c $325k and under clause 5.2d $1.14m.

Under clause 5.3 I will in addition receive that part of the half of costs which takes us to the ceiling of $2.4m.

In addition I have to date done work under clause 12.1 to the value of $350,000. I cannot collect that either until the end of the appeal.”


	
	In support of his assertion that he had a claim against Mr Thomson for a substantial sum for costs, the plaintiff forwarded, under cover of letter to Rabobank dated 1 June 2007, a copy of the deed dated 24 May 2006 (referred to above) pursuant to which the monies were said to be owing. The letter said:
	


“As mentioned in my email yesterday I attach a copy of the Deed with some deletions for the purposes of maintaining confidentiality.”


	
	In about early June 2007, at about the time the plaintiff had decided to purchase Reevesdale, he encountered Wally Meakes. Mr Meakes was also a solicitor. He had practised continuously since his admission on 12 February 1982. He and the plaintiff had become acquainted through their membership of the Tattersall’s Club in Sydney where their paths crossed from time to time on the club premises and environs.
	
	
	Once the plaintiff had confirmed Mr Meakes to be experienced in rural conveyancing, he asked him to do the conveyancing for his purchase of Reevesdale. On 4 June 2007 Mr Meakes received the sales advice notice from Mr Cassim. The sales advice notice recorded that the price at which Reevesdale was to be transferred was $1.675m. Mr Cassim sent Mr Meakes a copy of the sale contract.
	
	
	Later that day, 4 June 2007, the plaintiff sent an email to Mr Twyford and Mr Fitzsimons which was copied to Mr Meakes, in which he said in part:
	


“I thought I should let you know, the vendor has accepted my offer of $1.65m. He does not want to talk about farm equipment or furniture. He is not happy because as Billy Bridges said at about 11.45am today when conveying the acceptance, I am “stealing” this place.

I am fully confident that by month 6 or 9 at the outside I will see myself clear because of pending litigation results and an entitlement to very significant payment in litigation. Assuming full payment under the deed, I will receive $2.4m plus a further significant sum which has been incurred in relation to the appeal and assisting in the interference/ deceit action.

. . . .

The built in benefit at Reevesdale is that it is being bought cheaply. It is also a highly unusual historic property.

. . .

Although I appreciate that you will calculate my capacity to borrow on the securities differently (eg 85% on Cascade Street x $2.3m = $1.96m + 72.5% on Reevesdale @ $1.65m = $1.2m) I ask that the Reevesdale loan is set at 100% so that it is as tax effective as possible. Obviously that depends on both securities remaining in place.

On the above figures I can borrow $3.6m at those ratios.

. . .

I trust this undertaking will enable speedy consideration and approval as it would be a very great shame to miss out on this historic (and productive property) and time is now very much of the essence.

I have told the selling agent that I will sign a contract very shortly, assuming Rabo approval, but I will need to have that approval first.

Chris, could you get back to me as soon as possible as everything is in suspense until you do so and we are working on tight timetables.

You will also see that I have ccd this email to Wally Meakes, a property law specialist solicitor - with agricultural conveyancing expertise in addition.

If I run out of time before I depart for the UK (21 June) I will leave a power of attorney with Steve [Fitzsimons].

. . .”


	
	On 7 June 2007 the plaintiff sent an email to the real estate agent which was copied to Rabobank, his accountant and Mr Meakes in which he said in part:
	


“. . .

I hope this will be very quick – it needs to be – as this transaction is, of course, tax driven – apart from anything else.

. . .

Obviously Wally [Meakes] will need to move very quickly and the sooner Rabo gives the go ahead, the sooner we can all go into overdrive.

I am determined that this transaction goes ahead. I appreciate the work you have done in that regard. On this side of the fence, we intend that it will not falter.

. . .”


	
	Mr Meakes opened a file on 12 June 2007. When he received a copy of the draft contract, he reviewed it, together with the planning certificate dated 7 October 2005, and the information memorandum relating to the property. As he was going through these documents he made a file note of the matters which he wished to raise with the plaintiff including the following:
	


“We are awaiting the formal Contract from the Vendor’s solicitors in Goulburn.”


	
	He also noted in his file note:
	


17.   Schedule “E” sets out Notices to Purchasers of rural lands in the area and needs to be looked at carefully.


	
	I infer that this note was a reference to the following in Schedule E:
	


“3.   Intending purchasers are advised that legitimate rural and agricultural uses of land may include:

[list of activities including “extractive industries, mines and ancillary works”]

. . .

4.   Intending purchasers of rural land who consider they may have difficulty in living with the above practices being carried out on adjacent land should seriously consider their position with respect to purchasing in a rural area. Many rural and agricultural practices, by necessity, are carried out very early in the morning or late into the evening.”


	
	At about this time Mr Meakes delegated various matters relating to the Reevesdale transaction to Nina Spinelli, a paralegal who was working under his supervision.
	
	
	On 12 June 2007 Mr Meakes met with the plaintiff and went through the contract with him. Although the plaintiff was principally a commercial litigator and not a conveyancer, he appreciated, in 2007, the significance of exchange and completion. He also knew, that, generally, although not invariably, exchange preceded completion by a number of weeks to permit searches and inquiries to be made. He was also aware that, typically, a contract for sale of land included a certificate under s 149 of the Environment Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW) which set out information from government sources as to the zoning of the subject property and the particular uses to which it could be put.
	
	
	I accept Mr Meakes’ version of what occurred in the course of that conference on 12 June 2007. The plaintiff told Mr Meakes that he needed to settle by the end of June and that he had spoken with his accountant about prepaying interest with a view to making the transaction “tax effective”. He boasted that he was buying Reevesdale at “an extremely good price”. He acknowledged that the income from the property would not be sufficient to service the loan but announced, “that’s the point”. Mr Meakes asked him whether he had made inquiries about the local area and whether he had spoken with the neighbours, the Council and those in the local area to find out what was happening. Mr Meakes advised the plaintiff that such inquiries ought be made because they could affect the plaintiff’s enjoyment of Reevesdale. The plaintiff assured him that he had done his “due diligence” already.
	
	
	When the plaintiff told Mr Meakes that he would be going to the United Kingdom in late June, Mr Meakes asked him if he had sorted out the power of attorney with his accountant. The plaintiff told Mr Meakes that he wanted to appoint him as his attorney. Mr Meakes expressed reservations about that course but told him that he could take a power of attorney for emergency situations.
	
	
	Mr Meakes then sat beside the plaintiff and went through the draft contract with him. He raised the time period between exchange and completion with the plaintiff and suggested that the only practical way of ensuring completion by 30 June 2007 was to have exchange coincide with completion. The plaintiff agreed to this proposal.
	
	
	Mr Meakes drew the plaintiff’s attention to the fact that Reevesdale was subject to a mortgage granted by the vendor to Elders Rural Bank Ltd which would need to be discharged on settlement.
	
	
	Mr Meakes also took the plaintiff through the planning certificate and noted that Schedule E, cl 3 set out the legitimate uses of the land, which included extractive industries and mining. I am satisfied that he also drew the plaintiff’s attention to the note to intending purchasers of rural land in Schedule 3 which is set out above.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the plaintiff was untroubled by what he had learned from Mr Hannan about the possibility of a quarry being developed in the area near Reevesdale and indifferent to the warnings Mr Meakes gave him about the possibility of the permitted uses on neighbouring land. His desire to buy Reevesdale was quixotic: he was enchanted with the idea of living in a Georgian house on a rural property and attracted to the advantage of being able to claim all his interest, and much of his expenditure, as a tax deduction.
	
	
	Moreover the plaintiff enjoyed the sense that he had got the better of the vendor and had bought a property that he believed was worth $2.5m for only $1.675m. Indeed, when asked in cross-examination whether it was a “lifestyle property”, he responded that he would “categorise it as an undervalue acquisition”. Thus, he believed that he had, merely by purchasing a loss-making property that no one else seemed to want, made a profit of hundreds of thousands of dollars and thereby gained much needed equity which would permit him to increase his borrowings. His view was evident from the following exchange in cross-examination:
	


Q.  You understood that to be a property which was a lovely property to live in and to be in, and something you'd be proud to own and show off, but which was not ever going to pay its own way?

A.  Well in the sense of income, no, but in the sense of capital it already did the job.  It would ‑ it managed to cancel my worries about the immediate future.


	
	Whether the plaintiff’s infatuation with Reevesdale led him to refrain from reading the contract; whether he read it carefully or whether he merely skimmed it because it was largely in a standard form cannot be determined because the plaintiff’s evidence on the topic was not consistent (see below). I am satisfied that Mr Meakes sufficiently explained its salient features, and in particular the risks posed by the uses to which neighbouring properties could be put, and the need to make his own inquiries.
	
	
	Mr Meakes arranged for David Gal, a solicitor employed by Carneys, to prepare a general power of attorney, which the plaintiff executed, appointing Mr Meakes as his attorney.
	
	
	At some time after his conference on 12 June 2007, Mr Meakes received an updated planning certificate dated 17 January 2007 and reviewed it. It was not materially different from the one he had gone through with the plaintiff on 12 June 2007.
	
	
	On 14 June 2007 Mr Meakes received a counterpart contract for sale of Reevesdale from the vendor’s solicitors under cover of letter dated 13 June 2007. As at 19 June 2007 Mr Meakes understood that the plaintiff wanted to complete the purchase on 28 June 2007. He wrote a letter to that effect to the NAB, as outgoing mortgagee of the Paddington terrace.
	
	
	On 19 June 2007, Jagot J dismissed the developer’s appeal against the refusal of the development application in respect of the quarry development: CEAL Ltd v Minister for Planning [2007] NSWLEC 302. There is no evidence that either the plaintiff or Mr Meakes was aware at that time that the decision had been handed down or the result of the appeal.
	
	
	On about 21 June 2007 the plaintiff travelled to the United Kingdom with his wife, Lucinda to introduce her to his family and friends. He did not return until 14 July 2007. At times he was out of email and telephone contact while he was away. His solicitor, accountant and banker attempted, unsuccessfully on occasions, to communicate with him. His whereabouts while away included the “wilds of Lincolnshire”. He was also a spectator at Wimbledon.
	
	
	On 26 June 2007 Mr Fitzsimons rang Mr Meakes to suggest an alternative to a guarantee from the plaintiff’s company (which was required by Rabobank as a condition of the loan) and proposed that Mr Meakes could execute the guarantee on behalf of the company as the attorney for its sole director. Mr Meakes voiced his discomfort with the proposal and told Mr Fitzsimons that he would need to get instructions from the plaintiff. Mr Meakes attempted, without success, to contact the plaintiff by phone. He sent him an email at 8.43pm in which he expressed his concern that the matter could not settle by the end of the week (being Friday 29 June 2007) and listed the various reasons. There were difficulties with email reception to the plaintiff’s email address. On more than one occasion, Mr Meakes received a delivery status notification to say that there had been a delay in delivery.
	
	
	On 27 June 2007, Mr Twyford emailed the plaintiff and noted that he had not received a response to his email of 26 June 2007. The plaintiff, who was attending Wimbledon as a spectator at that time, did not respond.
	
	
	Eventually, the plaintiff sent an email on 28 June 2007 in which he instructed Mr Meakes to execute a guarantee on behalf of the plaintiff’s company to meet Rabobank’s requirements. He gave his father’s email address as an alternative means of communicating with him, as well as the phone number of a friend with whom he planned to stay. He also said:
	


“I’m having kittens here so can someone let me know where we are at!!!”


	
	On 28 June 2007 the plaintiff rang Ms Spinelli from the United Kingdom. They spoke about the execution of various finance documents. The plaintiff told Ms Spinelli that Mr Fitzsimons could sign the documents as a duly authorised officer. He instructed Ms Spinelli to speak with Mr Fitzsimons and return the letter of offer to Rabobank. At the end of the conversation he said:
	


“I want to settle today or tomorrow.”


	
	After this conversation Ms Spinelli spoke to Mr Fitzsimons, Mr Twyford and the vendor’s solicitors. She then sent an email to the plaintiff in part in the following terms:
	


“After speaking with Steve we decided that he should take steps to have himself appointed as an alternate director of Williams Solicitors so he can sign the Guarantee and the Letter of Offer as the Bank confirmed this morning that it could not accept the Letter of Offer as it was not signed by all parties to the transaction.

I also spoke with the Bank’s solicitors to try and have other requirements waived. Even though they were willing to accept signed documents tomorrow morning and waive some of their usual requirements, the problem is that there is no one here to sign the mortgage documents on your behalf today or tomorrow and they cannot settle without original signed mortgage documents. Accordingly, settlement cannot proceed today or tomorrow for this reason. I have confirmed this with Steve this morning.

I now need your instructions as to a new settlement date. I have had a call from the Vendor’s solicitors wanting to know the current position. If you could contact me by return email or phone me with instructions, I need to get back to the Vendor’s solicitor as quickly as possible.”

[Emphasis in the original.]


	
	On 28 June 2007 the NAB confirmed the payout figure of $995,635.12 if settlement occurred on that day and $995,846.93 if it took place on the following day. Rabobank confirmed that it could not settle until the letter of offer could be signed by all parties to the transaction.
	
	
	Early on Monday morning, 2 July 2007, the plaintiff telephoned Mr Meakes who was on his way to work. Mr Meakes expressed his concern about the difficulties in communicating with the plaintiff, who assured him that he had found another way to obtain the tax break he was seeking but that he still wanted to purchase Reevesdale. Mr Meakes explained to the plaintiff the difficulties associated with his executing the guarantee on behalf of the company, as he did not have a power of attorney from the company. The plaintiff told Mr Meakes that he would try to be more available in future.
	
	
	By letter dated 11 July 2007, the solicitors for Rabobank wrote to Mr Meakes confirming the loan amount of $3.025m for the following purposes:
	



	
		
			
			Purpose
			
			
			Amount
			
		
		
			
			Purchase of Reevesdale
			
			
			$1.65
			
		
		
			
			Refinance NAB loans
			
			
			$1m
			
		
		
			
			Fund working capital
			
			
			$375,000
			
		
	



	
	The plaintiff returned to Australia from the United Kingdom on Saturday 14 July 2007. On Monday 16 July 2007 he attended the offices of Carneys. Mr Meakes took him through the transaction documents. Mr Meakes also raised with the plaintiff the circumstance that Reevesdale was subject to an exploration licence by a gold company. The plaintiff responded:
	


“Lots of rural land in New South Wales is affected by exploration licences, and nothing happens. I’m very comfortable with proceeding to settlement. I think this is a great deal and I’m keen to get it done.”


	
	The plaintiff told Mr Meakes that he knew that Reevesdale had been on the market for a long time at a higher price; that he was worried about the delay; and that he did not want to miss out on getting the property. At the conclusion of the conference, the plaintiff, in the presence of Ms Spinelli, executed the transaction documents.
	
	
	On 19 July 2007 the vendor’s solicitors faxed a letter to Mr Meakes and said:
	


“We regret to advise that our client is in the circumstances not prepared to delay settlement any further.

We formally advise you that this matter will now not proceed.”


	
	On 20 July 2007 the plaintiff rang Ms Spinelli and told her that Mr Bridges had called him and told him that there were other purchasers who were interested in Reevesdale and who had offered $100,000 more. At that stage it was the plaintiff’s expectation that settlement would occur on 23 July 2007. Later that day the plaintiff rang Ms Spinelli again and told her that he would not increase his offer and that Mr Hannan was looking to see if something else was available. He told her, among other things:
	


“I need to find another property. There is one with more land near Lake Bathurst with 1,000 acres and it’s a nice farmstead. There’s also one by the lake with 650 acres but it doesn’t have historic buildings.”

“I want to go ahead with this one though.”


	
	Notwithstanding these communications, Mr Meakes telephoned the vendor’s solicitors to inform them that the transaction could be settled on Monday 23 July 2007. Contracts for the transfer of Reevesdale to the plaintiff were eventually exchanged and settled on Tuesday 24 July 2007. The purchase price was $1.675m. The Rabobank loan was secured by mortgages over the plaintiff’s terrace in Paddington and over Reevesdale. Cheques drawn on settlement included the sum of $20,137.50 to Elders Real Estate (the vendor’s co-agent) and $1,624,637.66 to Elders Rural Bank Ltd (the vendor’s mortgagee).
	
	
	In October 2007 the plaintiff came to know some of the local residents in Bungonia who told him what he had already learned from Mr Hannan in May 2007: that there had been litigation concerning the application approval for the quarry development. The plaintiff was informed by local residents that the proponents of the development still wanted to pursue the development.
	
	
	On 24 January 2008 the plaintiff wrote to Mr Twyford and purported to summarise his financial position in support of his application for a deferral of the date for repayment of $725,000 from 30 April 2008 to 30 June 2008 and an increase in borrowings from $3.025 to $3.5m. He informed Mr Twyford that the appeal in the Thomson matter would be heard on 10 March 2008 and that he would expect judgment by May 2008. He also foreshadowed an application for a 15 - 20 bedroom boutique hotel and conference centre in the coach house at Reevesdale. He summarised his position in the following sentence:
	


“You will see from the above that the current “squeeze” on my position is not one which ought to last long.”


	
	He sought to explain his relatively low work-in-progress (in his practice as a solicitor) as follows:
	


“As you know I have just got married and that took up a good deal of time so Work in Progress is not as good as it might be.”


	
	He also referred to an oral agreement whereby his neighbour in Paddington had agreed to buy his terrace for three times its market value, on the basis that it would be included in a larger development to be undertaken by his neighbour. The plaintiff’s evidence was that he understood the effect of the Statute of Frauds but considered that he could rely on the equitable doctrine of part performance as he had “done things on the property on the basis of what he [the neighbor] said”.
	
	
	The plaintiff reiterated to Mr Twyford the significance of the deed with Mr Thomson as follows:
	


“The litigation asset is encapsulated in a deed dated May 2006 between my client and myself. Basically the deed provides for payment upon the end of the litigation. The last avenue of appeal is where the matter now is. This litigation has been a drain on cashflow as it has gone from August 2001 to date and has represented perhaps 85% of my work over the period. Senior Counsel’s opinion is that we will win at the level we anticipate. That will result in an immediate entitlement to $2.4m first instance costs plus appeal costs of another $300k approximately. As stated the delay in having the appeal heard has thrown out initial calculations.”


	
	By email to Mr Twyford dated 29 February 2008, the plaintiff again sought to persuade Rabobank of his creditworthiness. He referred to the following projects:
	


I should add that since mid October I have been concentrating as well as legal work, on the job of establishing Payplan Australia P/L. I have 25% of that company. I have concluded a shareholders agreement and with the support of 5 banks it will be a success. Possibly a huge one. The large English parent (1300 employees) is bankrolling it. It is commencing ops in 1 month.

I have also commenced Abbility [sic] Australia P/L of which I have 33%. This is selling wheelchairs etc on ebay. The UK guy who has started it with me is the biggest UK seller (Arbitraging between China and the UK). It starts this Thurs.

I am also in the process of talking to 4 different insurance companies about setting up an insurance brokerage and claims agency…More of that anon.


	
	The plaintiff admitted in cross-examination that he had never received a cent from Payplan although its principal took him out for dinner “several times”. He also admitted that Ability Australia had not made any money, although he volunteered:
	


“At the time there was nothing to suppose that we wouldn't make money.”


	
	Nor had the plaintiff made any money from the proposed insurance brokerage and claims agency.
	
	
	In his tax return for the year ended 30 June 2008, the plaintiff recorded that he had suffered a taxable loss on Reevesdale of $109,000. The plaintiff accepted that he expended substantial amounts on Reevesdale between the time of its purchase and 30 June 2008, since interest costs alone did not account for the size of the figure.
	
	
	At some stage in 2008 or 2009 the plaintiff brought proceedings in this Court for specific performance of the alleged agreement with his neighbour to sell the Paddington terrace for three times its market value (referred to above). He did not obtain the relief sought.
	
	
	On 15 January 2009 Deacons, solicitors, wrote, on behalf of Mr Thomson, to Stephen Titus of Carneys informing him that any costs agreement that infringed either s 325 of the Legal Profession Act 2004 or the corresponding provision in the Legal Profession Act 1987 was not maintainable and that the deed between the plaintiff and Mr Thomson executed in May 2006 was “invalid and of no effect”.
	
	
	On 16 January 2009 the plaintiff wrote to Mr Meakes in part in the following terms:
	


“I write in connection with my purchase and the information supplied by the Goulburn Mulwaree Council or alternatively by the vendor.

Obviously I was unaware that there was proposed to be a quarry right on the boundary of Reevesdale.

. . .

What these circumstances have led to is the need for me to sell Paddington – rather than Reevesdale. It being the worst time for a property sale for many years. I will be forced to take a big loss on Paddington. That loss is approximately $1M. If I were to try to sell Reevesdale the loss is likely to be even worse.

In order to take action against the Council I need to obtain all of the relevant documents from my file. Please can you, therefore, send to me the following:

Contract for sale in the form exchanged including all of the documents appended or referred to.

All enquiries to the vendor and all responses.

All enquiries to the Goulburn Mulwaree Council and all responses.

Any other document dealing with material issues.

. . . “


	
	On 21 January 2009 the plaintiff reported on his financial situation to Mr Twyford. He informed him that he and his wife had moved out of the Paddington terrace to put it on the market and were living in rented accommodation nearby. He said of Reevesdale:
	


“Since we bought in July 2007 there has been a further application for a quarry next door. The Council did not disclose to us that the property was in a “buffer zone”. I am not sure yet whether Carneys Lawyers made the relevant enquiry. I have asked for the papers to be supplied to me. The Government is to make a decision on the quarry issue by May 2009. . . If Wally [Meakes] did not make appropriate enquiries then he has been negligent.”


	
	The plaintiff attached a copy of his letter to Mr Meakes to his letter to Mr Twyford as well as the facsimile from Deacons regarding the invalidity of the deed. The plaintiff also reported that his proposed business, Payplan Australia Pty Ltd, was going very well. I note that, although the plaintiff was prepared to inform Mr Twyford of the possibility that Mr Meakes had been negligent, he was not prepared to disclose that possibility to Mr Meakes himself and, indeed, did not do so prior to the commencement of these proceedings.
	
	
	On 18 July 2009 the plaintiff sold his Paddington terrace for $1.4m.
	
	
	On 25 August 2009 the plaintiff wrote to Richard Hincks, of Rabobank, seeking further accommodation. He purported to retain his belief, notwithstanding his knowledge of the proposed quarry development, that Reevesdale was worth significantly more than he paid for it and said:
	


“Let’s say that the farm is valued down to $2.1m (which will be temporary but in line with current conditions).”


	
	The plaintiff accepted in cross-examination that the following extract from a Rabobank internal memorandum dated 29 October 2009 accurately described his preference both then and in October 2010:
	


“His [the plaintiff’s] preference is to retain the rural property if possible and he has sold other assets during the recent real estate market downturn to rationalise his financial position.”


	
	The plaintiff suffered a brain abscess (as a result of undiagnosed diabetes) which manifested itself during the Oxfam trail walk in August 2010 and led to his collapse at the end of October 2010. He has not practised as a solicitor since.
	
	
	At some time prior to June 2011 the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning approved the development of a quarry on the land next to Reevesdale. No development has yet commenced. Notwithstanding this approval, the plaintiff’s desire to keep Reevesdale continued at least up to and including 2012 when he was obliged to sell it for financial reasons. Eventually, in May 2013, Reevesdale was sold for $805,000. The net sale proceeds were $708,451.
	
	
	On 27 May 2015 the plaintiff sent an email to Mr Couston, the solicitor for the defendants in these proceedings. After setting out why he thought he would win the case, the plaintiff wrote:
	


“Bill Bridges rang me very late in the piece to suggest that I had not offered enough. I immediately arranged to see a Lake Bathurst property with Les Hannan. I was getting quite keen on the Lake Bathurst property. But lo and behold Reevesdale came back on the table. No mention of a DA [development application] or a recently refused DA (with the process to be repeated by a determined DA applicant).”

Expert evidence on liability


	
	The plaintiff relied on the evidence of Ronald Heinrich who has been in practice as a solicitor, principally involved in conveyancing, since 9 December 1971. The defendants relied on the evidence of Edward Boyce, also an expert conveyancing solicitor, who was admitted to practice in New South Wales in February 1974. Their evidence was broadly to the same effect. They agreed that, as at 2007:
	



	
	Competent solicitors in New South Wales would have advised their clients to undertake inquiries of the Council to ascertain, relevantly, whether there were any proposed developments in the area which might adversely affect the client’s enjoyment of the property proposed to be purchased.
	
	
	Competent solicitors in New South Wales would not have conducted such inquiries themselves.
	



	
	Mr Heinrich explained that the purpose of recommending that a proposed purchaser make enquiries of the local Council was that Councils keep records of current or determined development applications in their planning departments and may also have a note or record of decisions of the Land and Environment Court that are germane to those applications. Accordingly a prospective purchaser could ascertain potential uses and development of surrounding land.
	
	
	The expert opinions were consistent with the following extract from a pro forma letter issued by the Law Society as at 15 November 2006 entitled ‘LETTER TO PURCHASER EXPLAINING CONTRACT FOR PURCHASE OF NON-STRATA RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY” which contained the following paragraph:
	


On the Planning certificate you will see that a number of uses are permitted on your property and on the adjoining properties provided Council’s approval is given pursuant to a development application. In other words, it is possible for lands with the zonings similar to yours to have erected upon them buildings other than //58a//. We recommend that prior to exchange of Contracts you call at the Council to ascertain whether there are any proposed developments in the area that might not be suitable to your particular enjoyment of the property.

[Emphasis in original.]


	
	Mr Heinrich also gave evidence of his own practice not only to advise a city buyer of a rural property to speak to the Council (as set out above) but also to speak to the neighbours.
	
	
	Mr Heinrich said that he was not aware of any accepted practice amongst rural conveyancers in New South Wales in 2007 of checking that their clients had in fact undertaken the inquiries that had been advised. He was not, however, asked as to his own practice in this regard. Mr Boyce said that if inquiries had been recommended and a solicitor was subsequently given instructions to exchange contracts, the solicitor would be entitled to proceed on the basis that the client had either satisfied himself or herself as to such inquiries, or elected not to make them. A solicitor would not be obliged to check that a client purchaser had made the enquiries the solicitor had recommended.
	


Valuation evidence


	
	Peter Reardon, a valuer, was engaged by Rabobank, on behalf of the plaintiff, to value Reevesdale as at 25 February 2008. He valued the property at $2m (comprising $900,000 for the land and $1.1m for the improvements). He also valued the property as instructed by Rabobank, for the plaintiff, as at 25 August 2009 at $1.8m (comprising $753,900 for the land and $1.05m for the improvements). He valued the property again as at 7 February 2012 and considered its market value to be $1.75m and its value on a forced sale to be $1.55m. Mr Reardon also said, in his report dated 7 February 2012:
	


“The property [Reevesdale] eventually sold in July, 2007 to the current owner [the plaintiff] for $1,675,000, which we consider to be very good buying and below current market value having consideration to a number of other sales of historical properties in the district at this time.”


	
	Mr Reardon was not required for cross-examination. His evidence was not challenged.
	


Evidence with respect to damages


	
	The plaintiff relied on the report of Mr Fitzsimons. The defendants relied on the expert evidence of Tamara Lindsay. Mr Sullivan QC, who appeared on behalf of the defendants, obtained, in his cross-examination of Mr Fitzsimons, the witness’ concessions to all of the matters raised by Ms Lindsay in her report. Accordingly, the evidence is (subject to legal submissions as to the recoverability of the damages) that the plaintiff has suffered losses, as calculated by Ms Lindsay, as follows:
	



	
		
			
			Relevant item
			
			
			Amount
			
		
		
			
			Loss on sale of Reevesdale
			
			
			$1.052m
			
		
		
			
			Loan establishment fees
			
			
			$17,729
			
		
		
			
			Operating losses of the primary production business
			
			
			$101,382
			
		
		
			
			A portion of the interest on the loan
			
			
			$1.008m
			
		
		
			
			TOTAL
			
			
			$2.179m
			
		
	


Credibility of witnesses

The plaintiff’s credibility


	
	I formed a very adverse view of the plaintiff’s credit, who was an unimpressive witness. I do not accept his evidence except where corroborated, against interest or consistent with uncontroverted or admitted facts. My reasons for this view are set out below.
	


The plaintiff’s mode of responding to questions


	
	The plaintiff appeared to be at pains to divine the forensic significance of each question asked of him before he formulated his response, which at times was not responsive to the question. The transcript is redolent with examples, of which the following exchange is one:
	


Q.  Why didn't you read the contract in full?

A.  Had Wally said to me that it was necessary for me to go and get advice from the council I would have done so.

Q.  Mr Williamson, you know that that is not an answer to my question don't you?

A.  Yes, well, it is in a way.

Q.  It is not in any way Mr Williamson, my question was in the context of the advice you give your own clients why did you not read the contract in full yourself?  That was my question.  Nothing else?

A.  Well, time.  Time.


	
	In making this assessment of the plaintiff, I have taken into account that his capacity to answer questions is likely to have been compromised in some way by the brain abscess and its consequences. However, although the plaintiff’s fluency may well have been marred, his capacity to find an answer that suited his interests at the time demonstrated that, whatever his disability, his mental processes were intact at least to that extent. Furthermore I note that the plaintiff did not rely on any medical evidence to the effect that his evidence was affected by his injury or that any of the matters referred to in this part of the reasons (dealing with the plaintiff’s credibility) ought not be regarded as adversely affecting his credit.
	


The plaintiff’s lack of recollection generally


	
	The plaintiff did not particularly recall the conference with Mr Meakes on 12 June 2007 although he accepted that it occurred. Nor did he have a good recollection of executing the documents. Although he denied being told that he ought make his own inquiries, he accepted, or did not deny, many of the propositions put to him in cross-examination by Mr Sullivan about what had occurred in the conference. He gave the strong impression that he had other things on his mind when he met with Mr Meakes and that he regarded the legal documents associated with the purchase of Reevesdale to be a necessary, but inconvenient, formality.
	


Whether the plaintiff read the contract for the purchase of Reevesdale


	
	The plaintiff was loath to admit that he had read the contract for the purchase of Reevesdale. Mr Sullivan put to him, in various ways, that he had done so. He responded variously, including as follows:
	



	
	He did not read the contract himself because he retained Mr Meakes to do it for him.
	
	
	He read some of the standard form parts of the contract but not the special conditions.
	
	
	He only read those parts of the s 149 certificate that were specifically explained to him by Mr Meakes.
	
	
	He did not read the contract because he did not have time, notwithstanding that he had time to go to the United Kingdom with his wife for a holiday of over three weeks.
	
	
	He did not take the contract with him to the United Kingdom because he did not think it was wise to interfere with the process of introducing Lucinda to his family and friends by “taking a total lot of books with me”.
	



	
	As referred to above, I am satisfied that the plaintiff, either through reading the contract himself, or being taken through it by Mr Meakes, was aware of all material conditions. The versions he gave, which are set out above, are largely irreconcilable. That he was prepared to offer such a range of versions reflected adversely on his credit.
	


The deed with respect to remuneration for the Thomson litigation


	
	The defendants also challenged the plaintiff’s credibility on the basis of the deed entered into to provide for his remuneration with respect to the Thomson litigation. The plaintiff’s preparedness, as an officer of this Court, to enter into an agreement that he appreciated was prohibited by the Legal Profession Act, did him no credit. The apparent egregiousness of his conduct was compounded by his disclosure of the deed, on a confidential basis, to Rabobank with a view to his persuading it to rely on the deed for the purposes of advancing money to him, in circumstances where he appreciated that the deed was unenforceable. His conduct in this respect was not only unscrupulous but also dishonest.
	
	
	I regard the plaintiff’s evidence that, although the deed was unenforceable, he had a claim in quantum meruit for the same, or a similar, figure as the product of forensic opportunism.
	


The proposition that, but for the purchase of Reevesdale, the plaintiff would have had to sell his Paddington terrace


	
	The defendants also sought to impugn the plaintiff’s credit on the basis of his insistence that, had he not purchased Reevesdale, he would have had to sell his terrace in Paddington. The plaintiff was adamant that the added “fat” associated with the Reevesdale purchase was what gave him additional borrowing capacity, which he needed, since he was at the limit of the facilities advanced by the NAB and did not have the income to service any increased borrowings. Although this version has some superficial plausibility, there are at least two obstacles to its acceptance.
	
	
	First, any “solution” provided by the additional borrowings from Rabobank was, at best, short-term. The loan agreement with Rabobank required the plaintiff to repay $600,000 by 30 April 2008. The loan monies were insufficient to allow for that repayment (since deductions had to be made from $3.025m of $1m (to repay the NAB) and $1.725m (for the cost of the purchase of Reevesdale including incidentals), leaving $300,000. The plaintiff admitted that, without the Rabobank funds, he was unable to meet his debts as and when they fell due. It is therefore difficult to see how the loan improved his financial position. At best, it provided no more than an ephemeral amelioration of his cash flow.
	
	
	Secondly, the Thomson deed was unenforceable and, in any event, Mr Thomson was not obliged to pay the plaintiff for his legal services until the litigation had concluded. Accordingly, there was no real prospect of any income from that quarter in the foreseeable future.
	
	
	Thirdly, the plaintiff insisted, in a different context, that he was most reluctant to sell Paddington for personal and financial reasons. He maintained that he did not want to disrupt the education of one of his children, who attended the local school. Further, he also asserted that he had an enforceable agreement to sell his terrace to his neighbour for three times its market value. He accepted, on the one hand, that he was bound by that agreement not to sell the terrace to a third party; while on the other, he maintained that he would have acted, in breach of the agreement, to sell the terrace had he not bought Reevesdale.
	


The plaintiff’s preparedness to lie about whether he was looking at other properties before he bought Reevesdale


	
	The plaintiff was cross-examined about telling Ms Spinelli that he was looking at other properties when the vendor of Reevesdale informed Mr Meakes that settlement would not proceed. He said in evidence that he had no intention of buying another property if he could not have Reevesdale but that he was “suspending the truth” for two days because he believed that Mr Bridges was not telling him the truth about the vendor’s not wanting to sell to him. He sought to justify what he admitted amounted to a lie (that he was looking at other properties) on the basis that he thought that Mr Meakes might say something to the vendor’s solicitor or to the agents. He agreed that he was prepared to lie to his own solicitor.
	
	
	He was also cross-examined about the email to Mr Couston sent on 27 May 2015 referred to above in which he said that he was getting “quite keen on the Lake Bathurst property”. He was unable to give any satisfactory explanation as to how he could reconcile his recent statement with his case that, had he not purchased Reevesdale, he would not have purchased another rural property and he would have had to sell his Paddington terrace. I reject his evidence that the words “lo and behold” in the email imported such an ironic tone into the whole of the paragraph that no part of it could possibly be taken either literally or seriously.
	


The plaintiff’s evidence about when he found out about the proposed quarry development and his response


	
	The plaintiff gave evidence that he found out about the prospect that there would be a quarry near Reevesdale when he became acquainted with local residents in October 2007, who told him that there had been litigation. He agreed that he was “annoyed” when he found out but said that he complained to no one but his wife (who was not called to give evidence) because he “didn’t think there was anything done wrongly”. I regard this evidence as irreconcilable with the plaintiff’s case.
	
	
	The plaintiff presented as acutely conscious of his legal rights and ready to blame others for bad outcomes. Had he really believed, in October 2007, that Mr Meakes had in any way failed to fulfill his duties to him as a solicitor, I have no doubt that he would not only have written to Mr Meakes but also used the putative claim for damages in correspondence with Mr Twyford, who was the recipient of forecasts of numerous money-making schemes or pots of gold to which the plaintiff asserted he would be able to resort to solve his impecuniosity. Although the plaintiff insinuated to Mr Twyford in January 2009 that there was a possibility that Mr Meakes had been negligent, he did not pursue the allegation, or even disclose it to Mr Meakes, until he filed the statement of claim in these proceedings.
	
	
	When the plaintiff was cross-examined about the proposed development of the coach house at Reevesdale to which he referred in his letter to Mr Twyford dated 24 January 2008 set out above, the following exchange occurred:
	


Q.  You will agree will you not that when describing to the bank the Reevesdale property you are talking of it in very glowing terms and in very encouraging terms about its outlook?

A.  At that stage I felt a bit of a glow.  It's difficult because I had the application and I knew that the application was, you know, foretelling the awful day would come when the rocks and sand all went past the front door.  But I thought that if we got the, you know, made Bungonia into a tourist attraction that we could ward off the possibility of a planning consent.


	
	The plaintiff’s answer manifested, in my view, not only his cavalier approach to the truth but also his forensic flexibility. He realised that plans made in 2008 to develop Reevesdale as a tourist facility were inconsistent with his case that he found out in October 2007 that a quarry development was proposed on the adjacent land and that, if he had found out earlier, he would not have purchased Reevesdale at all. Accordingly, he sought to use the development to advance a case that he was trying to make the best of a bad lot by resisting the quarry development by creating a tourist destination. Moreover the disparity between the letter and the objective facts revealed his grandiloquence. He was, at the time of the letter, on the brink of a substantial default to Rabobank and had no funds to comply with the facility, much less develop Reevesdale.
	
	
	He also gave evidence that it did not occur to him until 2012 that it was Mr Meakes’ responsibility to advise him to make enquiries of the Council. Mr Sullivan reminded the plaintiff of his letter to Mr Twyford dated 21 January 2009 (in which he made an allegation of negligence against Mr Meakes). He responded by saying that he did not even know if Mr Meakes had a duty to give that advice in 2009. The following exchange ensued:
	


Q.  Is this the situation, that you as an honourable solicitor were prepared to write to your banker accusing your own solicitor of negligence when you didn't even know whether that solicitor had a duty of care in that regard, is that a serious answer Mr Williamson?

A.  I thought that he did, but then I thought that he didn't.

The plaintiff’s preparedness to engage in conspiracy theories


	
	The plaintiff submitted that I should reject Mr Hannan’s evidence because Elders Real Estate (for whom Mr Hannan worked) was associated with Elders Rural Bank Limited (the mortgagee of the vendors of Reevesdale) and therefore had a motive to conceal from Mr Meakes the development application for the quarry. The plaintiff admitted, when challenged, that there was no evidence to suggest that there was any connection between the real estate agent and the vendor’s mortgagee. I regard the plaintiff’s submission of a conspiracy theory based on a connection between Elders Real Estate and Elders Rural Bank Limited as one borne of desperation and designed to impugn Mr Hannan’s evidence, which the plaintiff appreciated destroyed his case.
	


Jones v Dunkel inference


	
	The plaintiff’s wife was with the plaintiff when he had the discussion with Mr Hannan referred to above about the placards on Mountain Ash Road on the way to Reevesdale. She and the plaintiff remain on good terms despite their separation. He continues to contribute to her financial support and that of their children. The plaintiff did not call her as a witness in his case. I infer that her evidence would not have assisted his case and more readily draw the inference that Mr Hannan’s evidence is to be accepted in preference to the plaintiff’s where they are in conflict. I do not accept the plaintiff’s evidence that he complained to his wife about Mr Meakes’ conduct in October 2007 when he spoke to local residents who told him of the quarry development.
	


Mr Hannan’s evidence


	
	In March 2015 Mr Hannan was diagnosed with bowel cancer. He consulted an oncologist on 25 March 2015. In early April 2015 he informed Mr Couston, the solicitor for the defendants with carriage of the proceedings. On 21 April 2015 he affirmed an affidavit setting out his recollection, including of conversations he had had with the plaintiff and the local resident about the quarry protest signs and the occasion on which he had inspected Reevesdale with the plaintiff.
	
	
	In May 2015 it was proposed that, in light of Mr Hannan’s declining health, his evidence be taken in Goulburn as it would be difficult for him to attend court. Directions were made on 9 June 2015 to permit Mr Hannan to give evidence by audio-visual link from a remote location. Laura Acton, a solicitor assisting Mr Couston, visited Mr Hannan at St Vincent’s Hospital in Sydney on 18 June 2015 at which time he signed a further statement in which he made a few corrections to the contents of his affidavit.
	
	
	On 25 June 2015 Ms Acton visited Mr Hannan in hospital and arranged for him to affirm a second affidavit which incorporated the statement he had signed on 18 June 2015. During this period it became increasingly clear that Mr Hannan would not be able to give evidence. On 3 July 2015 he died.
	
	
	By reason of these circumstances, Mr Hannan’s evidence could not be tested in cross-examination. This must be taken into account in assessing its weight.
	
	
	However, I accept Mr Sullivan’s submission that the circumstances in which Mr Hannan’s affidavits were executed tell in favour of his reliability. Mr Hannan had no interest, whether financial or otherwise, in the proceedings or their outcome. That he was prepared to spend any of his residual precious time or energy on the evidence in this case when his prognosis was so dire suggests that his version is true.
	
	
	Moreover, Mr Hannan’s evidence has a certain verisimilitude in light of what has emerged about the plaintiff. It is entirely consistent with the view I have formed of the plaintiff that he would say, when Mr Hannan mentioned the Land and Environment Court, that he knew where it was. The plaintiff’s fondness for Reevesdale was not affected when, on his admission, he learned of the application in October 2007. It is difficult to see, in those circumstances, why he would have been deterred by what Mr Hannan passed on by way of local knowledge when he followed up the plaintiff’s enquiry about the significance of the protest signs.
	


Mr Meakes’ credibility


	
	Mr Meakes has an obvious interest in the outcome of the proceedings. The relevant events, as far as he was concerned, took place in June and July 2007. The first time he had any indication that his conduct was to be called into question by the plaintiff was in 2012, when the statement of claim was served. Mr Meakes did not make a file note of his meeting with the plaintiff on 12 June 2007, although he did make a file note of the matters that concerned him when he went through the draft contract and the out-of-date s 149 certificate in preparation for that meeting.
	
	
	Each of these matters tends to reduce the weight that can be attached to Mr Meakes’ evidence. However, when the plaintiff put to Mr Meakes in cross-examination that he could not really remember the detail of the matter, Mr Meakes’ response was such as to persuade me that he had a good recollection of the transaction notwithstanding the passage of time. The transcript does not capture the tenor of Mr Meakes’ evidence. However I set it out because it shows that the plaintiff and this transaction made a significant impression on Mr Meakes.
	


“Q.  How did you remember?

A.  Well I remember Mr Williamson because in this matter I had a desire to make sure that I knew ‑ that you knew everything about this transaction because this was a matter where you were going overseas, where you expected me to settle the matter where you gave me instructions to settle it within a week.  And I remember going through the contract with you, spending a lot of time with you.  In that first conference on 14 June we spent an hour going through the contract, I was able to ‑ I had the benefit of the file note that I made in relation to the perusal of the contract when I first got the documents, the information memorandum and the contract and I prepared a file note in relation to those matters and I had that‑‑

. . . that file note that I made in June 2007 alerted me to the issues in schedule E and there's reference to that in the file note that I made and that's why I had a concern.  I had you coming into my office, I knew that you were going to go overseas.  The matter was very urgent and I had a desire to make sure that you knew everything about the contract and that's why I spent an hour with you going through that contract.

. . .

A.  I don't have a file note of that meeting.  I have the file note that I prepared in readiness for that meeting.

Q.  On page 86/65 you say, ""schedule E sets out notices to purchasers of rural lands in the area and needs to be looked at carefully""?

A.  That's correct.

. . .

Q.  And this was the basis on which you say that you told me to make a search of the local council?

A.  That is one of the things that I base my advice on, but the other element is that when I met with you, and after we spoke about me not providing you with taxation advice or financial advice, I advised you that you should make inquiries with the local council, with the neighbours, in the local area‑‑

Q.  Come on, come on.  You didn't because had you done so I would have said, ""I will make inquiries with the neighbours‑‑

. . .

Q.  I put it to you Mr Meakes that nothing of the sort happened?

A.  I completely disagree with that.

Q.  Where is it set out?

A.  I've already referred to it.  It is set out in numerous areas of my affidavit Mr Williamson.  It's on page 6, also when I'm talking to you about clause 34 in the contract about refractive industries there's a further reference in numerous parts of my affidavit saying that we will carry out searches ‑ ""our searches are related to the property.  Inquiries in relation to neighbouring lands and other areas adjoining our property must be made by yourself"".

Q.  Let's suppose that if you did say these things did you check that I'd done them?

A.  No.  Because you told me that you'd carried out your due diligence.”


	
	I accept Mr Meakes’ evidence. He came across as a diligent solicitor who was concerned to protect his client but also concerned neither to allow the apparent urgency of the transaction; nor his prior acquaintance with the plaintiff; nor their common club membership (which the plaintiff described as a “brotherhood”); nor the plaintiff’s qualifications and experience as a solicitor to compromise proper and prudent practice. Mr Meakes’ unwillingness to use the power of attorney in what he considered to be an inappropriate way (when the plaintiff asked him to execute the guarantee on behalf of the plaintiff’s company) is further evidence of this.
	


Liability

The causes of action alleged


	
	The plaintiff alleged the following causes of action against the defendants:
	



	
	Breach of either an express or implied contract arising from Mr Meakes’ alleged failure to advise him to inquire of the Council and of the neighbours about developments on surrounding properties; or his alleged failure to check that he had carried out such inquiries or alternatively, Mr Meakes’ alleged failure to conduct those searches himself;
	
	
	A co-existent breach of duty of care on the same basis as (1);
	
	
	An action for damages for contravention of the Trade Practices Act against Carneys and of the Fair Trading Act against Mr Meakes by reason of the following representations which are said to arise by silence:
	



	
	That Mr Meakes would carry out all necessary searches and inquiries to ascertain whether there were proposed developments on adjoining properties that might affect the plaintiff’s enjoyment of Reevesdale;
	
	
	That the plaintiff need not undertake any such inquiries himself.
	


The terms of the contract of retainer and the extent of the duty of care


	
	The contract of retainer was not relevantly express. Accordingly, the plaintiff must establish that there was an implied term to the effect alleged. Before any such term can be implied it is necessary that it pass the three-fold test adopted in Codelfa Constructions Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of NSW (1982) 149 CLR 337 at 347 that it be necessary to give business efficacy to the contract; that it be so obvious as to go without saying; and that it not be inconsistent with any express term of the contract.
	
	
	Mr Sullivan accepted that there was an implied term of the contract of retainer that required the defendants to advise the plaintiff to make inquiries of the local council to ascertain whether there were any proposed developments in the area surrounding Reevesdale that might affect the plaintiff’s enjoyment of the property. The defendants also accepted that the co-extensive duty of care they owed to the plaintiff required them to give him such advice. I note that it was not suggested by the plaintiff that the defendants’ retainer imposed any higher duty in contract than in tort.
	


Whether Mr Meakes advised the plaintiff to conduct the relevant inquiries regarding surrounding properties


	
	There is a contest of credit between the plaintiff, who denied that Mr Meakes advised him to conduct inquiries of the Council and the neighbours as to developments or proposed developments on surrounding properties, and Mr Meakes, whose evidence was that he had given that advice.
	
	
	The plaintiff has failed to discharge the onus of proving that Mr Meakes did not give him such advice. Indeed, I accept Mr Meakes’ evidence that he did in fact give him such advice. The file note created by Mr Meakes when he received the draft contract and the out-of-date s 149 certificate prior to meeting with the plaintiff on 12 June 2007 indicated that he turned his mind to the very question of developments on surrounding properties in a rural setting. Moreover, I accept Mr Meakes’ recollection of his meetings with the plaintiff, as set out above, during which he raised such matters.
	
	
	I am satisfied that Mr Meakes, having advised the plaintiff to carry out those inquires, did not represent either that he would carry them out himself or that the plaintiff did not need to carry them out.
	


Whether the duty of care or the retainer required Mr Meakes to conduct the enquiries himself or to check that the plaintiff had carried out the inquiries


	
	I accept the defendants’ submissions that the duty of care they owed to the plaintiff neither required Mr Meakes to carry out such enquiries himself, nor to check with the plaintiff that he had conducted such enquires himself. Nor can a term imposing such an obligation be implied in the contract of retainer. The evidence of Mr Heinrich and Mr Boyce did not support the imposition of either of these obligations. For a solicitor to be required to undertake inquiries as to developments on properties surrounding the subject property without specific instructions from the client to do so would amount, in my view, to an unjustified extension of a solicitor’s retainer. Questions of commercial and lifestyle risk are not generally within such a retainer, which is principally concerned with ensuring that good title passes from vendor to purchaser and that the purchaser is aware of any matter that may affect that title.
	
	
	Moreover, the suggestion that a solicitor should check with a client to make sure that he or she has followed the solicitor’s advice (to conduct inquiries of the Council) presupposes a level of paternalism which is inconsistent with the usual relationship between a solicitor and a client, at least in circumstances where a client is not under a relevant disability.
	
	
	Accordingly, although it is accepted that Mr Meakes neither conducted the relevant inquiries himself, nor checked with the plaintiff that he had conducted the relevant inquiries, he was neither in breach of his contract of retainer nor his duty of care by omitting to do those things.
	


Conclusion as to breach


	
	By reason of the foregoing, the plaintiff has not established that Mr Meakes breached his contract of retainer with the plaintiff or that he was in breach of the duty of care he owed to the plaintiff. Nor has he established that any of the representations alleged against Carneys or Mr Meakes arising from the Trade Practices Act or the Fair Trading Act were made, either expressly or by silence. I note for completeness that the defendants accepted, for the purposes of these proceedings, that any such representations as were made were made in trade and commerce, as required by the legislation. I understood the basis for the concession that it did not expose the defendants to any greater liability than that to which they would be exposed in contract or tort.
	
	
	It follows from these findings that the plaintiff has not made out any claim to relief and that there should be judgment for the defendants. However, as I am obliged, as trial judge, to make all relevant factual findings, I propose to address the question of causation.
	


Causation


	
	Although there are some cases where the question of causation might be resolved differently whether the claim is brought in contract, tort, or under the Trade Practices Act or the Fair Trading Act, the present is not such a case (subject to the principles of remoteness, which are addressed below). In this case, Mr Meakes was obliged by the contract of retainer and the duty of care he owed to the plaintiff to advise him to make his own inquiries, at least of the Council if not the neighbours. The representations alleged are either that the inquiries did not need to be made or that Mr Meakes would make the inquiries himself, on behalf of the plaintiff.
	
	
	For the reasons given above, I accept Mr Hannan’s evidence that the plaintiff noticed the placards and was told that they related to a protest against the quarry development and that Mr Meakes advised him to make his own inquiries. That the plaintiff was prepared to go ahead and buy Reevesdale in the knowledge that there was a quarry proposed in the vicinity is a powerful indication that he was unconcerned about what would have been revealed had he inquired of the Council or the neighbours, as recommended by Mr Meakes.
	
	
	Moreover, although I do not necessarily believe that the plaintiff was too busy to read the contract between the time he received it (on or about 12 June 2007) and the time he executed it (on 24 July 2007), his priorities seemed to revolve around Lucinda and his trip to the United Kingdom, rather than looking after his own financial interests or acting on advice of persons such as Mr Meakes.
	
	
	Furthermore, the matter the plaintiff relied on for the purposes of these proceedings as being what would have changed his mind about buying Reevesdale, is the very matter of which he was made aware by Mr Hannan, following his inquiry regarding the significance of the placards.
	
	
	I am satisfied that the plaintiff did not make any inquiries of the Council or the neighbours, notwithstanding that he was aware of the quarry development from speaking with Mr Hannan and notwithstanding that he had been advised to do so by Mr Meakes. In these circumstances, whether or not Mr Meakes had advised him to make those inquiries, the plaintiff would still have purchased Reevesdale.
	
	
	The narrative set out above indicates the plaintiff’s reluctance to sell Paddington on both personal and financial grounds. I do not accept that, had the plaintiff not purchased Reevesdale, he would have sold his Paddington terrace in mid-July 2007 (which he contended was a better market). Even if the NAB was not prepared to extend its facilities any further, it is likely that the plaintiff would have been able to use the Paddington terrace to increase his borrowings with another lender. I regard the plaintiff’s argument that he had to buy Reevesdale to keep Paddington as captious, for the reasons given above.
	
	
	Accordingly, the plaintiff has failed to establish factual causation in negligence (as required by s 5D(1)(a) of the Civil Liability Act 2005 (NSW); see also Wallace v Kam [2013] HCA 19; 250 CLR 375 at [14] – [16]), contract or under the Trade Practices Act or Fair Trading Act.
	


Damages


	
	The measure of damages in contract is the amount of money required to put the plaintiff in the position he would have been in had the contract been performed; in tort, the measure is the money to put the plaintiff in the position he would have been in had the tort not been committed: Gates v City Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd [1986] HCA 3; 160 CLR 1. A similar test is used to assess damages under the Trade Practices Act or the Fair Trading Act: Kizbeau v WG and B Pty Ltd (1995) 184 CLR 281 at 290, including footnote (11); Henville v Walker [2001] HCA 52; 206 CLR 459 at [30] – [31] per Gleeson CJ.
	
	
	In order to assess damages, I am obliged to assume (contrary to my findings above) that Mr Meakes did not advise the plaintiff to make inquiries of the Council and that, had he done so, the plaintiff would have gone to the Council. Had this occurred, the plaintiff would have found out that the quarry development had not been approved and that an appeal against its refusal had been dismissed: CEAL Ltd v Minister for Planning. In my view it is inconceivable that, in these circumstances, knowing that the developer’s appeal had been dismissed, the plaintiff would not have purchased Reevesdale.
	
	
	However, accepting the counterfactual for the purposes of these reasons, and accepting that the plaintiff would not have purchased Reevesdale had he made inquiries of the Council, he has suffered no loss. The reason for this is that the unchallenged evidence of Mr Reardon was that Reevesdale was worth $2m as at 25 February 2008 (being seven months after the plaintiff purchased it for $1.675m). Furthermore Mr Reardon considered that Reevesdale had been “very good buying” and “below current market value” when the plaintiff purchased it for $1.675m.
	
	
	Mr Reardon’s evidence comprises the only evidence of the value of Reevesdale at the time the plaintiff purchased it. The plaintiff has, accordingly, failed to establish that Reevesdale was worth less than he paid for it. The reduction in the value of Reevesdale from the time of its purchase by the plaintiff to the time of its eventual sale in 2013 was due, according to the unchallenged view of Mr Reardon, to the general reduction in the area, rather than to anything specifically related to the proposed quarry development, which has not, in any event, commenced.
	
	
	In these circumstances, the starting point is the rule of practice derived from Potts v Miller that the measure of damages (for deceit, and by analogy, tort and contract) is usually the difference between the real value of the property at the time of purchase and what the plaintiff paid for it. The “real” value is the appropriate integer, rather than the market value, because hindsight can also be taken into account: Kizbeau v WG and B Pty Ltd at 291. Consequential losses (such as the expenses associated with the acquisition) may also be recoverable.
	
	
	The plaintiff did not provide any basis for displacing the rule in Potts v Miller. He did not suggest that he could not have sold Reevesdale earlier than he in fact sold it. To the contrary, the evidence showed that he was very reluctant to part with Reevesdale and would have retained it had he been able to. That he sold Paddington years before he sold Reevesdale is further evidence of this. In these circumstances, the plaintiff has failed to prove that he has suffered any loss as a result of the defendants’ conduct.
	
	
	The loss from the sale of the Paddington terrace is not recoverable in light of my finding on causation. However, even had factual causation been established, the loss would have been too remote to be recoverable in contract (Hadley v Baxendale (1854) Exch 341 at 354; 156 ER 145 at 151); tort (s 5D of the Civil Liability Act); or under the Trade Practices Act or the Fair Trading Act (Henville v Walker, at [136]).
	
	
	It also follows from these findings that none of the consequential losses claimed is recoverable.
	
	
	In these circumstances, it is not necessary to address Mr Meakes’ partial defence by reason of the Law Society of NSW Scheme under the Professional Standards Act 1994 (NSW).
	


Orders


	
	I make the following orders:
	



	
	Judgment for the first and third defendants.
	
	
	Unless a written application is made to my associate within seven days for a different order, order the plaintiff to pay the first and third defendants’ costs of the proceedings.

2768729,R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 21) [2016] NSWSC 24,"Judgment


	
	JOHNSON J: At the trial of the Accused, A2, KM and Shabbir Mohammedbhai Vaziri, the Crown called two children, C1 and C2, to give evidence in the Crown case.
	
	
	The nature of the charges brought against the Accused persons, and the role of C1 and C2 as witnesses in the trial, may be discerned sufficiently from my judgment of 8 September 2015: R v A2; R v KM; R v Vaziri (No. 4) [2015] NSWSC 1306. In that judgment, I determined that C2 was competent to give sworn evidence at the trial, and I overruled an objection made by C1 and C2 under s.18 Evidence Act 1995 to giving evidence in the trial where their mother, A2, was an Accused person.
	


Pretrial Ruling Concerning Suggested Leading Questions and s.37 Evidence Act 1995


	
	In advance of the trial, objection was taken on behalf of the Accused persons to parts of the recorded interviews of each child which were said to contain leading questions. The recorded interview of each child was to be played to the jury as part of the evidence-in-chief of the witness, pursuant to ss.306U and 306V Criminal Procedure Act 1986.
	
	
	To the extent that any question used in the recorded interviews was held to be a leading question, the Crown sought leave under s.37 Evidence Act 1995 to permit leading questions to be used in the examination-in-chief of the witness.
	
	
	Written submissions were provided on behalf of the Accused persons and the Crown on these issues (Pretrial MFIs 40 and 41).
	
	
	At the conclusion of submissions on this aspect on 10 September 2015, I announced my ruling in the following terms (PT732):
	


“On the defence objection to certain questions and answers of C1 and C2 during their recorded interviews of 29 August 2012, I am not persuaded that each of the questions objected to are leading questions for the purpose of the Evidence Act 1995. To the extent that any particular question is capable of being characterised as a leading question, having considered factors under s 192 of the Evidence Act 1995, I grant leave to the Crown under s 37(1)(a) of the Evidence Act 1995 to ask that question with respect to each of C1 and C2.

Accordingly, I overrule the objections to the challenged parts of the recorded interviews of 29 August 2012 of C1 and C2. I will publish my reasons at a later time for this ruling.”

Trial Rulings Concerning s.42 Evidence Act 1995


	
	C1 was called as the first witness in the trial. She gave evidence by way of closed-circuit television with her evidence-in-chief being constituted substantially by her recorded interview.
	
	
	The Crown made application under s.42 Evidence Act 1995 seeking to restrict the use of leading questions in cross-examination of each of C1 and C2 (MFI4).
	
	
	Submissions were made by counsel on the s.42 application. At the conclusion of argument, I stated that I would give more detailed reasons for the ruling at a later time. However, for the assistance of counsel and to allow the trial to proceed directly before the jury, I said (T112-113):
	


“I will give more detailed reasons for this ruling at a later time. However, for the assistance of counsel at this time I indicate that with respect to the cross examination by Mr Bouveng on behalf of the accused [KM] that I am satisfied that the facts concerned would be better ascertained if leading questions were not used with respect to the subject matters referred to in paragraph 3 of the Crown's written submissions which relate to what is really the sole issue in dispute in this trial. Those are what happened to [C1] before, during and after the alleged FGM procedure, [C1’s] understanding of khatna, how [C1] felt during, before and after the procedure and any conversation that [C1] may have had with any third parties, including relatives, about the alleged FGM procedure. I exclude from that the investigating officials who interviewed her on 29 August 2012.

I note in this respect that if Mr Bouveng commences his cross examination with the use of non leading questions that will, I trust, allow the Court to understand what the position of the witness is in response to the facts in issue on the critical issue. I note that this ruling does not stop Mr Bouveng from drawing the witness' attention to a particular question or answer in the interview. That is not a leading question but an introductory question which would then lead to the next question which, for the first part at least, should not be a leading question.

I note that this issue may be revisited in the light of the answers given by [C1] to Mr Bouveng in cross examination in response to non leading questions. In particular, if [C1] maintains the account given in the recorded interview, MFI 2, it would be appropriate for Mr Bouveng to have an opportunity to put his client's instructions to [C1] at what would be the last phase of his cross examination. However, whether that position is to be reached will depend upon what the witness says in response to non leading questions. If the position is reached where counsel seek to raise with me that scenario where Mr Bouveng should be permitted to ask leading questions to put instructions, then it should be indicated that there is a further question of law, I will ask the jury to leave and I will deal with this promptly.

I note that Mr Sutherland SC has indicated that whether he seeks to cross examine the witness at all will be dependant [sic] upon the cross examination of Mr Bouveng, so I do not at this stage say anything with respect to the possible cross examination by Mr Sutherland SC for the other accused.

I hope that what I have said makes sufficiently clear what the position is in the first phase, at least.”


	
	Following the evidence of C1, in which cross-examination on behalf of the Accused persons did not seek leave under the second-phase approach referred to in my judgment, the Crown called C2 to give evidence. Further submissions were made by counsel concerning the Crown application under s.42 Evidence Act 1995 with respect to C2.
	
	
	Following those submissions, I gave short reasons for granting the Crown s.42 application, and foreshadowed that more detailed reasons would be provided at a later time. The short reasons concerning C2 were as follows (T168-169):
	


“At the conclusion of submissions yesterday on the Crown's application under section 42 of the Evidence Act 1995 that leading questions not be allowed on four topics with respect to the witnesses [C1] and [C2], I expressed at pages 111 to 113 of the transcript a ruling with an indication that I would provide more elaborate reasons for this ruling at a later time. I propose to adopt the same approach as that taken yesterday and as expressed at that point in transcript with respect to the witness [C2] who is now giving evidence. It is not necessary to repeat all that was said in those pages of the transcript, but it can be taken that that will be the approach which I take.

I note that in relation to the evidence yesterday of [C1] the point was not reached where Mr Bouveng sought to ask leading questions and thus the second phase, if I could use that term, did not arise. If the second phase was going to arise in the case of [C2], then it would be appropriate that counsel indicate that there is a legal issue, I will invite the jury to withdraw, I hope for a very short period, just to confirm the parameters of what was to happen next. 

Whether that arises or not depends obviously upon the course of cross examination which will be undertaken up to that point. I express those short reasons for a ruling.”


	
	Cross-examination of C2 was brief, with leave under the second phase not being sought (T177-185).
	
	
	This judgment contains my detailed reasons for the rulings made on 10, 16 and 17 September 2015.
	


Relevant Statutory Provisions


	
	Section 37 Evidence Act 1995 concerns the use of leading questions in examination-in-chief. The section provides:
	


“37    Leading questions

(1)    A leading question must not be put to a witness in examination in chief or in re-examination unless:

(a)    the court gives leave, or

(b)    the question relates to a matter introductory to the witness’s evidence, or

(c)    no objection is made to the question and (leaving aside the party conducting the examination in chief or re-examination) each other party to the proceeding is represented by an Australian legal practitioner, legal counsel or prosecutor, or

(d)    the question relates to a matter that is not in dispute, or

(e)    if the witness has specialised knowledge based on the witness’s training, study or experience—the question is asked for the purpose of obtaining the witness’s opinion about a hypothetical statement of facts, being facts in respect of which evidence has been, or is intended to be, given.

(2)    Unless the court otherwise directs, subsection (1) does not apply in civil proceedings to a question that relates to an investigation, inspection or report that the witness made in the course of carrying out public or official duties.

(3)    Subsection (1) does not prevent a court from exercising power under rules of court to allow a written statement or report to be tendered or treated as evidence in chief of its maker.”


	
	Section 42 is concerned with the restriction on the use of leading questions in cross-examination. Section 42 provides:
	


“42    Leading questions

(1)    A party may put a leading question to a witness in cross-examination unless the court disallows the question or directs the witness not to answer it.

(2)    Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to disallow the question or give such a direction, it is to take into account the extent to which:

(a)    evidence that has been given by the witness in examination in chief is unfavourable to the party who called the witness, and

(b)    the witness has an interest consistent with an interest of the cross-examiner, and

(c)    the witness is sympathetic to the party conducting the cross-examination, either generally or about a particular matter, and

(d)    the witness’s age, or any mental, intellectual or physical disability to which the witness is subject, may affect the witness’s answers.

(3)    The court is to disallow the question, or direct the witness not to answer it, if the court is satisfied that the facts concerned would be better ascertained if leading questions were not used.

(4)    This section does not limit the court’s power to control leading questions.”


	
	The term “leading question” is defined in the Dictionary to the Act in the following way:
	


“leading question means a question asked of a witness that:

(a)    directly or indirectly suggests a particular answer to the question, or

(b)    assumes the existence of a fact the existence of which is in dispute in the proceeding and as to the existence of which the witness has not given evidence before the question is asked.”


	
	The term “examination in chief” lies within clause 2 of Part 2 of the Dictionary to the Act:
	


“(1)    A reference in this Act to examination in chief of a witness is a reference to the questioning of a witness by the party who called the witness to give evidence, not being questioning that is re-examination.

(2)    A reference in this Act to cross-examination of a witness is a reference to the questioning of a witness by a party other than the party who called the witness to give evidence.

(3)    A reference in this Act to re-examination of a witness is a reference to the questioning of a witness by the party who called the witness to give evidence, being questioning (other than further examination in chief with the leave of the court) conducted after the cross-examination of the witness by another party.

(4)    If a party has recalled a witness who has already given evidence, a reference in this Act to re-examination of a witness does not include a reference to the questioning of the witness by that party before the witness is questioned by another party.”


	
	To the extent that s.37(1)(a) involves a grant of leave by the Court, s.192 is pertinent. That provision states:
	


“192    Leave, permission or direction may be given on terms

(1)    If, because of this Act, a court may give any leave, permission or direction, the leave, permission or direction may be given on such terms as the court thinks fit.

(2)    Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to give the leave, permission or direction, it is to take into account:

(a)    the extent to which to do so would be likely to add unduly to, or to shorten, the length of the hearing, and

(b)    the extent to which to do so would be unfair to a party or to a witness, and

(c)    the importance of the evidence in relation to which the leave, permission or direction is sought, and

(d)    the nature of the proceeding, and

(e)    the power (if any) of the court to adjourn the hearing or to make another order or to give a direction in relation to the evidence.”

The Objection to Leading Questions in the Recorded Interviews of C1 and C2 and the Crown’s Application for Leave Under s.37 With Respect to Any Leading Questions


	
	Counsel for the Accused persons objected to the following parts of the recorded interview with C1, upon the basis that leading questions were asked in examination-in-chief (Exhibit PT11):
	


“Q389 [Investigating official] Well, I heard that it means, um, that it’s something that some young girls have, and that it’s like a type of cutting to the private part.

A [C1]. Yeah, it is.

Q390 It is. How do you know that?

A. Because it’s happened to me.

Q391 Because it’s happened to you. When did it happen to you?

A. When I was the age of seven.

…

Q603 Yeah, ah, just one question. Are you able to explain exactly what happens ---

A. Nuh-uh.

Q604 --- in your words.

A. No. Well, they give um, a little cut there. No, not very much, because I’m not used to talking about it either, because, um, my mum tells me not to go around telling everyone that much. That’s all.

Q605 OK. When, when you say, um, they, they give a little cut there, where do, what do you mean by there?

A. In your private part.”


	
	Objection was taken upon the same basis to part of the recorded interview with C2 (Exhibit PT12):
	


“Q194 [Investigating official]  We heard that, that that word [khatna] means something that some young girls have, O.K., where they have a cut to their private parts. Tell me what you know about that?

A [C2]. I don’t know.

Q195 You don’t know or you don’t want to tell me?

A. I don’t know what that is.

Q196 Pardon?

A. I don’t know what that is.

Q197 You don’t know what that is. We heard that you had a cut on your private parts. Is that true?

A. Yes.

Q198 Yeah. When was that?

A. I don’t know.

Q199 You don’t know when it was. Where were you when that happened?

A. Home.

Q200 At home. And who else was at home?

A. I don’t know.”


	
	It was submitted that Q389 (in the case of C1) and Q194 and Q197 (in the case of C2), in particular, were leading questions, with a flow-on effect into subsequent questions so as to render them leading questions as well.
	
	
	It was submitted for the Accused persons that the Crown should not be granted leave under s.37(1)(a) to adduce this evidence by way of leading questions. By reference to s.192 of the Act, it was submitted that:
	



	
	the granting of leave to the Crown to “ask” these questions in the recorded interviews of C1 and C2, instead of the questions and answers being deleted from the interviews and being asked in a permissible method by the Crown, will only shorten the length of the hearing by a small extent: s.192(2)(a);
	
	
	a grant of leave as sought by the Crown would be unfair to both the witnesses and to each of the Accused persons where the questions suggested that the gravamen of the offence in s.45 Crimes Act 1900 had occurred to C1 and C2: s.192(2)(b) - reference was made to the ages of C1 (eight years old) and C2 (six years old with a mild intellectual disability) at the time of each interview, with reference also being made to the reports of psychologists, Dr Susan Pulman, Dr Gary Banks and Ms Alison O’Neill (Exhibit PT13), being supportive of the use of non-leading questions in the interviewing of children: s.192(2)(b);
	
	
	the questions asked related to the ultimate (and only) facts in issue in the trial, namely what was the nature of the procedure performed on C1 and C2 by KM - it was submitted that the evidence can easily be adduced in a permissible fashion by the use of non-leading questions by the Crown: s.192(2)(c).
	



	
	The Crown submitted that the questions objected to, when viewed in context, were not leading questions (Pretrial MFI41). Should the Court hold that any of the questions were leading questions, the Crown submitted that leave should be granted under s.37(1)(a) for that evidence to form part of the examination-in-chief of each of C1 and C2.
	
	
	The Crown referred to parts of the interviews of C1 and C2, before and after the questions which drew the objection. It was submitted that the impugned questions must be seen in context in each case, with that process supporting a grant of leave under s.37(1)(a) with respect to each of C1 and C2.
	
	
	For the purposes of s.192(2), the Crown submitted that the evidence was important and that the subject matter of the questions concerning intimate parts of each child was relevant. It was emphasised that the proceedings were against the mother of C1 and C2, with whom they both lived.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that it would not be unfair to a party or either witness to grant leave under s.37(1)(a).
	


Reasons for s.37 Ruling


	
	It may be taken that s.37 Evidence Act 1995 applies to questions asked in a recorded interview which is to be tendered as part of a child’s evidence-in-chief by way of ss.306U and 306V Criminal Procedure Act 1986. Although some rules of evidence are relaxed by s.306V(1), s.306V(4) makes clear that the Court may rule as inadmissible the whole or any part of the contents of a recording adduced as evidence under these provisions. It is notable, however, that such objections do not relate to a question asked in Court by counsel. Those circumstances attract an objection, followed by submissions and a ruling. In that context, of course, an application for leave under s.37 may be considered in the dynamic context of the trial itself while the witness is giving oral evidence.
	
	
	Here, the questions under challenge were asked in the course of an investigatory interview undertaken with each of C1 and C2 more than three years before. Because of the provisions contained in ss.306U and 306V Criminal Procedure Act 1986, the questions and answers in the recorded interviews may become part of the evidence-in-chief of the relevant vulnerable person.
	
	
	This does not mean that the prohibition contained in the Evidence Act 1995, upon the use of leading questions in examination-in-chief, does not apply. Clearly, the provision has application as the contents of the interview become part of the evidence-in-chief of the witness. Other bases of objection might also arise in a particular case. In this case, the only objection taken to the questions referred to at [19] and [20] above was made upon the basis of the use of leading questions.
	
	
	I am satisfied that Q/A389 (in the case of C1) and Q/A194 and 197 (in the case of C2) constitute leading questions within the definition of that term in the Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	I am not so satisfied with respect to the balance of the questions which are objected to upon the same basis. The other questions under challenge do not, in my view, fall within the terms of the statutory definition.
	
	
	In the case of C1 (Q/A390-391; Q/A603-605), the questions are not leading and it could not be fairly concluded that they are somehow tainted by a type of flow-on effect. Both the words used in questions and answers, and the appearance of C1 in the video-recorded interview, support such a characterisation.
	
	
	A similar conclusion should be reached concerning C2, although she was more tentative in her appearance in the recorded interview.
	
	
	The question then arises as to whether the Crown should have leave under s.37(1)(a) of the Act to (in effect, retrospectively) adduce such evidence by means of a leading question. It has been observed that a ruling concerning the use of leading questions involves the exercise of discretion in the particular case by the trial Judge: Heydon, “Cross on Evidence”, 10th Australian edition, paragraphs [17,155]-[17,160].
	
	
	In exercising discretion under s.37(1)(a), in the context of a s.306U recorded interview, it is important to bear in mind the nature of the interview being undertaken, the age of the person being interviewed and to consider the particular question or questions under objection against the background of the interview in its entirety. It should be kept in mind that the interview is part of an investigatory process, although its potential use under ss.306U and 306V is also important.
	
	
	Likewise, it is most important that the interview was video recorded, so that the jury was in a position to see and hear the conversation, and to form a view as to the significance (if any) of any leading question.
	
	
	Having assessed the entirety of the recorded interview with C1, I was satisfied that leave ought be granted to the Crown to adduce evidence in the one leading question which I have identified. At the time of the interview, C1 was about nine years old. The question under challenge lay in the midst of a lengthy recorded conversation with the investigating officials.
	
	
	Fairly read, the recorded conversation involved a developing willingness of C1 to open up to the questioners in a number of respects. The interview took place against the background that C1 had been told by her mother not to discuss the topic of what had happened on the occasion of the alleged circumcision. The interview discloses an increasing willingness of C1 to talk to the investigators, mentioning at one stage that she (C1) felt “safe” (Q/A223). Although the interview progressed some way without C1 readily being prepared to discuss the event under consideration, she did so in a convincing and plausible fashion after the questions under objection. Nearly all the factual matters referred to by her were not disputed.
	
	
	It was also relevant to the exercise of discretion, for the purpose of ss.37 and 192, that further evidence to be adduced by the Crown involved conversations with others which referred to the fact that C1 had mentioned that she had been “cut”.
	
	
	In my view, the particular vice which has been identified with the use of leading questions does not arise in any realistic way in this case. Further, to excise a small part of a lengthy interview, and to proceed with the Crown having to ask a non-leading question on one topic out of a long interview, would involve an unrealistic process which would not serve the purpose of adducing relevant and meaningful evidence, in particular from a child by that time aged some 12 years. As observed earlier, the jury was in a position to form its own view concerning the significance (if any) of the leading question, given that a contemporaneous video recording was relied upon by the Crown.
	
	
	I was satisfied that it would not be unfair to any party or the witness to grant leave: s.192(2)(b). The evidence was important to the Crown case: s.192(2)(c). The refusal of leave would likely have extended the hearing: s.192(2)(a).
	
	
	For these reasons, I determined that the use of the leading question (identified above at [30]) ought be permitted by way of a grant of leave under s.37(1)(a) Evidence Act 1995 with respect to C1.
	
	
	In considering the leave issue with respect to C2, I had regard, as well, to the fact that she volunteered later in the interview that she felt “hurting … in my bottom” (Q/A232-233). The jury could assess this, as well, in considering the earlier reference to being “cut”.
	
	
	I was satisfied, having regard to ss.37 and 192, that leave ought be granted to the Crown to adduce this evidence from C2. My reasoning for this conclusion was similar to that expressed with respect to C1. This was an objection to certain questions in the course of an investigatory interview with a child, then aged six years. The jury could see and hear the interview, and form their own view concerning the role of the leading questions in the course of a long interview.
	
	
	In reaching these conclusions concerning C1 and C2, I had regard to the evidence of psychologists to which the Court was taken. I considered the opinions of the psychologists having taken into account the entirety of the interview with each child independently.
	


Crown Objection Under s.42 Evidence 1995 to the Use of Leading Questions in Certain Areas in the Cross-Examination of C1 and C2


	
	The Crown submitted that there ought be a limit upon the use of leading questions in the cross-examination of C1 and C2 with respect to four identified topics:
	



	
	what happened to each of them before, during and after the alleged female genital mutilation (“FGM”) procedure;
	
	
	the understanding of each child of the term “khatna”;
	
	
	the description of each child as to what she felt during, before and after the procedure; and
	
	
	any conversation that each child may have had with third parties (especially family members) about the FGM procedure.
	



	
	The Crown submitted that there was some evidence that A1, the father of C1 and C2, had sought to influence the children (and, in particular, C1) on the afternoon of the interviews with the children on 29 August 2012. In this respect, the Court was taken to a conversation in a motor vehicle between A1 and C1 on that afternoon which was recorded by way of surveillance device. The Crown relied, as well, upon a recorded conversation between the mother, A2, and C1 and C2 where she discussed what had been asked of each of them in the interview earlier that day, and chided them for discussing what had happened (Exhibit AD, page 8).
	
	
	The Crown relied, as well, upon s.42(2)(d), noting the age of each child and some evidence of mild intellectual disability on the part of C2.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the Court should be satisfied that the facts concerned would be better ascertained if leading questions were not used on these topics during cross-examination of C1 and C2 by counsel for the Accused persons.
	
	
	Counsel for the Accused persons opposed the making of any order s.42 restricting their capacity to use leading questions in cross-examination. It was submitted that a proper basis had not been demonstrated for such an order.
	


Reasons for s.42 Ruling


	
	In determining this question, I had regard, in particular, to the age of C1 and C2 and the material before the Court concerning the mild intellectual disability of C2: s.42(2)(d).
	
	
	In circumstances where the evidence-in-chief of each of C1 and C2 was to be constituted primarily by their recorded interviews made some three years before, I considered that this was a case where the use of s.42 was appropriate. In this respect, it was relevant that C1 and C2 were living with their parents, A1 and A2, so that additional care was warranted in the ascertainment of facts by means of questions asked in Court on behalf of the Accused persons.
	
	
	It was significant that A2, the mother, had spoken to each of C1 and C2 on the afternoon of 29 August 2012 and said the following concerning the interviews (Exhibit AD, page 5):
	


“You told them everything. I told you not to say, any one. I told you not to say. Now we are in trouble because of this. I told you this is a big secret. This is what she came to find out. Now we are in trouble because of that. We told you my child this is a big secret, never tell anyone.”


	
	There was evidence, as well, that A2, her husband, A1, and KM had advanced or embraced a false story at different times, in the form of the “Africa checking story”.
	
	
	Evidence of this type supported a conclusion that “the facts concerned would be better ascertained if leading questions were not used” (at least in the first instance) in cross-examination.
	
	
	There was a live question as to whether C1 and C2 would fall within s.42(2)(b) and (c), with the use of non-leading questions allowing the Court to consider these aspects further.
	
	
	As was pointed out by Mr Bouveng, counsel for KM, it remained important that he have the ability, depending upon the answers given to him by each of C1 and C2 in answer to non-leading questions, to challenge each witness by use of leading questions so that he could contradict their accounts in a manner that allowed him to put his client’s version before the witness, in accordance with the principle in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67.
	
	
	As indicated in the extracts containing my rulings at [9] and [11] above, I considered that a two-phase approach was appropriate given the subject matter of the questions and the particular factors existing in this case, where each child witness had been living since August 2012 with their parents, one of whom was on trial for the alleged offences said to have been committed against the girls.
	
	
	I was satisfied, for the purpose of s.42(3), that the facts concerned would be better ascertained if leading questions were not used in the cross-examination of each of C1 and C2 initially. Proceeding in this way allowed counsel for the Accused persons to ask questions which elicited a response to relevant matters, with the capacity to revisit the s.42 ruling by way of a second phase of questioning (using leading questions) if the Court considered that appropriate.
	
	
	In the event, neither Mr Bouveng nor Mr Sutherland SC asked questions moving beyond the first phase allowed in my ruling. Neither considered it necessary, in the circumstances of the evidence of each of C1 and C2, to seek to cross-examine by way of leading questions so as to confront each witness with a suggested contrary account.
	
	
	I record my view that the practical outcome of the ruling made by me under s.42, with respect to C1 and C2, meant that facts were better ascertained by counsel for the Accused persons using non-leading questions. The fact that defence counsel did not feel it necessary to revisit the s.42 ruling, by way of a second-phase argument, confirmed my conclusion that the approach permitted counsel to question each witness in a manner that was consistent with a fair opportunity to adduce evidence from each child.
	


Conclusion


	
	It was for the reasons here expressed with respect to the ss.37 and 42 issues, that I made the rulings on those topics set out earlier in this judgment.

		08 February 2016",2016-02-04 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2769877,Vu v R [2016] NSWCCA 136,"Judgment


	
	THE COURT: The appellant, Mr Vu, was convicted by a jury of one count of supplying a prohibited drug (heroin) in an amount not less than the commercial quantity (352.2g), contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW).
	
	
	He was sentenced by Lakatos DCJ in the District Court to a term of imprisonment for 7 years, comprising a non-parole period of 4 years and 9 months commencing on 15 March 2013 and expiring on 14 December 2017 and a balance of term of 2 years and 3 months expiring on 14 March 2010. The maximum penalty for the offence of which the appellant was convicted was 20 years imprisonment, a fine of $350,000 or both. A standard non-parole period of 10 years applied.
	
	
	The Crown case, in summary, was that on 9 February 2012, the appellant and his co-accused (his former wife) had heroin in their possession for the purposes of supply, the heroin being found by police in a packet of tortilla chips in the footwell of the front passenger seat of a car then being driven by the appellant. The Crown case was that the appellant was given the chip bag shortly beforehand by Mr Tan Phong Le at a convenience store in Newtown. The appellant had come from Melbourne to Sydney to acquire the drug. The police had intercepted telephone communications between Mr Le and the appellant prior to the meeting at which the appellant was given the chip bag containing heroin. The quantity of heroin contained in the chip bag was subsequently certified as being 352.2g, with a purity of 47%. It had a street value of between $90,000 and $150,000.
	
	
	The appellant pleaded not guilty.
	
	
	On the second day of the trial, the jury forwarded the trial judge a note in which the jury expressed the desire to handle a bag with weight equivalent to 352g of heroin and a normal chip bag, as a comparison. Objection was raised by Counsel for the appellant to the demonstration, on the basis that the probative value of the demonstration was low and that it would result in unfair prejudice to the accused. The trial judge allowed the demonstration, determining that the evidence was probative, carried no attendant unfair prejudice and had little prospect of misleading or confusing if conducted in open court in front of all the parties.
	
	
	By notice of appeal filed 8 February 2016, the appellant appealed his conviction on the following grounds:
	


(1)   The trial Judge erred in permitting the demonstration, which demonstration resulted in a miscarriage of justice.

(2)   The Summing Up on knowledge of the quantity of drugs alleged to have been supplied.

(3)   The directions on circumstantial reasoning and inferences reversed the onus of proof and obscured the standard of proof.


	
	Written submissions were filed on behalf of both the appellant and the Crown on each of the grounds of appeal. Relevantly, the Crown accepted that knowledge of the involvement of a commercial quantity of a particular drug was an essential element of the offence in question (Fung v R [2007] NSWCCA 250; (2007) 174 A Crim R 169 at [42]) and that the trial judge erred in failing appropriately to direct the jury as to this element. Nevertheless the Crown (in its written submissions) suggested that this may be an appropriate case for the application of the proviso pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).
	
	
	At the outset of the hearing of the appeal, Senior Counsel for the appellant (Mr Game SC) advised the Court that the parties would be asking the Court to deal first with ground 2 (i.e., that in respect of which the Crown conceded error) and to quash the appellant’s conviction in respect of the contravention of s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. He invited the Court to substitute a verdict of guilty on the statutory alternative charge (which he accepted was open on the jury’s verdict) of supplying a prohibited drug in an amount not less than the indictable quantity under s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. Mr Game indicated that, in that event, the appellant would not press grounds 1 and 3 of his appeal and would ask the Court to re-sentence him rather than remitting the matter to the District Court for sentencing on the s 25(1) conviction.
	
	
	The Crown agreed with that approach and indicated that it would not be pressing the proviso point in relation to the error the subject of ground 2 of the grounds of appeal. Insofar as leave was required to raise ground 2 (because it had not been the subject of a complaint at trial as to the trial judge’s directions to the jury), the Crown did not raise any objection to such leave being granted.
	
	
	For the appellant, an affidavit sworn 6 July 2016 by his solicitor was read, without objection, going to the re-sentencing issue. Mr Game also helpfully provided the Court with notes on re-sentence.
	


Determination


	
	The Court, having had the opportunity prior to the hearing of the appeal to read and consider the submissions of both parties in relation, inter alia, to ground 2, was satisfied that there was error established in that the trial judge failed to direct the jury that they needed to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant knew that he was in possession of a commercial quantity of the drug in question. Ground 2 was therefore made good (and was quite properly so conceded to be by the Crown). For completeness, the Court proceeded on the basis that leave to raise ground 2 as a ground of appeal was not opposed.
	
	
	As to the re-sentencing, Mr Game indicated to the Court that the Court could proceed on the basis that there was no contest as to the matters referred to by the sentencing judge in his remarks on sentence (though submitting that on re-sentencing the Court would not treat the planned and organised nature of the criminal activity as an aggravating feature).
	
	
	For the appellant, it was submitted that the Court should proceed to re-sentence him on the basis that the quantity of the drug involved was substantial but not exceeding 250g (the threshold for the s 25(1) offence). The Crown’s position was that the Court should accept that the quantity was close to but not exceeding 250g. The Crown submitted that this was at the upper end of the indictable offence pursuant to s 25(1).
	
	
	The Court adjourned following the hearing of the submissions for both the appellant and the Crown and then proceeded on 6 July 2016 to re-sentence the appellant as follows, indicating that reasons would be provided in due course:
	



	
	Grant leave to appeal.
	
	
	Allow the appeal.
	
	
	Quash the conviction of the appellant for the offence of supplying a prohibited drug (heroin) in an amount not less than the commercial quantity contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW).
	
	
	Pursuant to the power under s 7(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), convict the appellant of one count of supplying an indictable quantity of a prohibited drug (heroin) contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW).
	
	
	Sentence the appellant to a non-parole period of 3 years and 5 months commencing 15 March 2013 and expiring 14 August 2016 and a balance of term of 1 year and 1 month expiring 14 September 2017.
	
	
	Note that grounds 1 and 3 of the appellant’s grounds of appeal are not pressed.
	


Reasons


	
	At the hearing of the appeal Mr Game asked the Court to note that the appellant was content for the Court to provide brief remarks only on sentence. The following are the Court’s reasons (in brief compass) for making the above orders.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the s 25(1) offence is 15 years. There is no applicable standard non-parole period. Having regard to the evidence at the trial as to the quantity of heroin in the chip bag, the appellant should be re-sentenced on the basis submitted by the Crown, namely that he supplied close to but not exceeding 250g of heroin. That is, on any view, a substantial quantity. The street value of that amount of heroin at the relevant time may be assumed (by extrapolating from the value of the larger quantity of drugs as found by the trial judge) to have been somewhere in the range between $64,000 and $105,000.
	
	
	There was no issue taken by the appellant with the finding by the trial judge as to the probability that he proposed to take the drugs to Melbourne and deal with them in some manner; nor as to the conclusion (based on the purity of the drug) that it was the intention of the appellant or his associates further to cut the heroin prior to its on-supply; nor as to the appellant’s role being more than that of a mere courier and being part of a planned and organised criminal activity. There was no evidence of money changing hands or that this was other than an isolated incident, but the trial judge concluded (and again the appellant does not cavil with this conclusion) that since the appellant was not a drug user he was involved to further the supply enterprise.
	
	
	As to the appellant’s subjective circumstances, the evidence before the trial judge was that the appellant did not have any significant criminal history and was largely a person of good character. The trial judge considered that there was not sufficient material to make a reliable forecast as to the likelihood of re-offending or prospects of rehabilitation. However, before this Court, there is evidence (in the form of his solicitor’s affidavit) that while in custody the appellant has participated productively in work and has completed a course in construction work, from which it may be concluded that there are favourable prospects of rehabilitation. The evidence also supports the conclusion that the appellant has the support of his family, who regularly travel some distance to visit him in prison. He is now 45 years of age and, when released from custody, will reside with his partner and two younger children in Melbourne. His solicitor has deposed that the appellant intends to complete further studies and, in due course, seek employment as an electrician.
	
	
	The finding of special circumstances in the appellant’s case is warranted, for the reasons given by the trial judge. Further, it should be noted that, by proposing and submitting to this manner of resolution of his appeal, the appellant is facilitating the course of justice.
	
	
	Balancing the above matters, the Court concluded that the sentence to be imposed on the appellant for the s 25(1) offence should be as stated above.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The sole question arising for determination on this appeal is whether the deceased motorcyclist, whose estate is represented by the first respondents, was guilty of contributory negligence on the facts found by the trial judge and accepted by counsel for the appellant. A lorry-cum-trailer driven by the second respondent along Anson Road in the direction of Robinson Road entered its junction with Maxwell Road when the traffic lights were in its favour. The appellant was driving a motor car. The deceased and the appellant drove their respective vehicles along Maxwell Road from the direction of Shenton Way. The deceased jerked to a stop about three feet away from the off-side of the lorry, inside the junction but the appellant`s car which was travelling on the off-side of the deceased`s motorcycle and to its rear entered the junction without stopping and collided with the towbar of the lorry. This resulted in the car spinning to its right as it was dragged forward by the lorry and thereby colliding with the deceased`s motorcycle.
The motorcyclist died as a consequence of the appellant`s undoubted negligence as found by the trial judge which is not disputed before us. The sole contention of counsel for the appellant is that, notwithstanding the negligence of the appellant in driving into the junction when it was unsafe to do so and thereby colliding with the lorry-cum-trailer and the deceased motorcyclist whose death he caused by negligence, the deceased also caused or contributed to his own injury and was part author of his own misfortune.
On the principle emerging from 
 Radburn v Kemp 
[1971] 1 WLR 1502
 it is clear that the deceased motorcyclist and the appellant who was driving his car on a parallel course to that taken by the deceased into the junction were both negligent in entering that junction at a time when the lorry was already well inside that junction and right across their paths. 
 Radburn`s 
 case establishes that even if at that stage the lights in Maxwell Road had changed to green in favour of the deceased and the appellant when they entered the junction it would nevertheless have been negligent on their part to proceed into the junction in the prevailing circumstances. As Edmund Davies LJ in 
 Radburn`s 
 case described the position of persons like the deceased and the appellant: 
 
the defendant driver had no business, despite the lights being in its favour, to enter the junction at all unless he was satisfied that it was safe for him to do so, and, once he had entered it, no right to proceed further across the junction without taking the utmost care to save harmless people who rightly were already on the junction before he entered it.
 
 
 
They would both undoubtedly have been negligent had the lights been then against them as they more probably were. The deceased motorcyclist, however, jerked to a stop about three feet short of the lorry whereas the appellant who had been pursuing a parallel course to that taken by the deceased but on the deceased`s right and slightly to his rear proceeded into the junction and failed to avoid the lorry-cum-trailer with whose towbar an impact took place resulting in his spinning round to his right and being dragged along in circumstances which caused his car to collide with the deceased motorcyclist who was then in a stationary position sandwiched between the appellant`s car and the trailer at almost the same time as or immediately after he, the appellant, came into collision with the lorry-cum-trailer.
The important question which arises for determination, as urged upon us by counsel for the appellant, is whether by placing himself in that position three feet short of the off-side of the lorry-cum-trailer as it was crossing the paths taken by both the deceased and the appellant, the deceased was guilty of contributory negligence. It is not in dispute that the lorry driver was not guilty of any negligence at all as found by the trial judge.
Contributory negligence when set up as a defence does not depend on any duty owed by the injured party to the party sued and all that is necessary to establish such a defence is for the appellant to prove that the deceased did not in his own interest take reasonable care of himself and contributed, by his want of care, to his own injury (see 
 Nance v British Columbia Electric Railway Co 
[1951] 2 All ER 448 per Viscount Simon at 450).
After referring to the full analysis of the legal concepts involved by the English Court of Appeal in 
 Davies v Swan Motor Co (Swansea) 
[1949] 2 KB 291
. Viscount Simon continued: 
 
This, however, is not to say that in all cases the plaintiff who is guilty of contributory negligence owes to the defendant no duty to act carefully. Indeed, it would appear to their Lordships that in cases relating to running-down accidents like the present such a duty exists. The proposition can be put even more broadly. Generally speaking, when two parties are so moving in relation to one another as to involve risk of collision, each owes to the other a duty to move with due care, and this is true whether they are both in control of vehicles, or both proceeding on foot, or whether one is on foot and the other controlling a moving vehicle.
 
 
 
A plea that the deceased was guilty of contributory negligence is wide enough to cover the contention that he was careless of his own safety, even though he may not have owed a duty to the appellant to be careful.
Viscount Simon referred to the fact that it is, perhaps, unfortunate that the phrase, `contributory negligence` uses the word `negligence` in a sense somewhat different from that which the latter word would bear when negligence is the cause of action and observed that in the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945 of the United Kingdom Parliament (which is similar to our corresponding Act in Singapore), the contrast between the two meanings is recognized. That Act provides for a sharing of responsibility for damage where a person suffers damage as a result partly of his own fault and partly of the fault of any other person or persons, and `fault` is defined as being: 
 
... negligence, breach of statutory duty or other act or omission which gives rise to a liability in tort or would, apart from this Act, give rise to the defence of contributory negligence.
 
 
 
Such a plea, ie a plea of contributory negligence, should be treated as setting up want of care by the plaintiff for his own safety, whether in the circumstances of the accident the plaintiff owed a duty to the defendant or not.
In the circumstances of 
 Nance`s 
case the Privy Council restored the decision of the original trial judge to the effect that the street car driven by a motorman of the respondent company was solely negligent for ramming into and killing the deceased, who was then crossing the road on slippery ice at sometime between 11.00pm and midnight, the evidence being that the street car had stopped some 75 feet away to pick up passengers and then restarted without warning and knocked down and killed the deceased as he was crossing the road.
We cite 
 Nance`s 
case not because of its particular facts or the findings thereon but for the principles enunciated which arise for consideration when contributory negligence is set up as a defence which it is for the defendant to prove.
Not long afterwards in 1953 another case involving British Columbia Electric Railway Co Ltd arose, ie the case of 
 Sigurdson v British Columbia Electric Railway Co Ltd 
 
[1953] AC 291
 where one Sigurdson who wanted to drive from one side of the street to the other, after beginning to turn, stopped on a street car track in the centre of the road. The driver of the street car had an unobstructed view, but did not see Sigurdson until he was 75 feet away, so that there was a collision. The jury found the driver of the street car was negligent in not keeping a proper lookout and that Sigurdson was not negligent. This decision, after being reversed on appeal, was upheld by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.
Inter alia, the trial judge directed the jury to consider whether Sigurdson was also guilty of some negligence which contributed to the accident as alleged by the company, ie `that he was the author of his own injury knowing that the street car was coming along there and driving in front of it contrary to the by-law and other regulations; in crossing the street aside altogether from the question of the regulations and taking chances of crossing there under the circumstances`. In the result the jury found that Sigurdson was not guilty of negligence which contributed to the accident. The Privy Council, per Lord Tucker, held that: 
 
the jury were entitled to come to the conclusion, taking a broad view of the case as a whole, that the negligence of the motorman was in the circumstances the sole cause of the accident irrespective of the precise moment at which he became aware of the danger.
 
 
 
In his comment on this case in the 
 Cambridge Law Journal 
for 1954 at p 45, Professor CJ Hamson, says: 
 
... not only is the `principal` in 
 Davies v Mann
good law but a recital of that celebrated donkey`s misfortune is still effective actually to fix upon one wrongdoer sole responsibility for an accident to the occurrence of which the other party`s misbehaviour was relevant.
 
 
 
It is satisfactory to note that in 
 Sigurdson`s 
case we have been spared any observations upon the question whether the plaintiff`s negligence was continuing or not. In spite of some apparent authority to the contrary - which was recently given further currency in the opinions of the House in the 
 Boy Andrew Case 
[1948] AC 140
 - it should be self-evident that, at any rate in the normal collision case, the plaintiff`s negligence, if relevant at all to the occurrence of the accident, necessarily continues up to the moment of the accident. Sigurdson necessarily continued to be at fault whilst he continued to lie wrongfully astraddle the track, just as much as the owner of the donkey continued to be in breach of his duty so long as it remained hobbled in the highway. The interest of 
 Sigurdson`s 
 case, as much as of 
 Davies v Mann, 
lies precisely in the fact that despite the continuance of the plaintiff`s negligence up to the moment of impact the defendant is held solely responsible for the collision.
We need not be overly concerned with the facts of 
 Sigurdson`s 
case because the battle there was entirely between two parties to an accident, only one of whom was found to be solely to blame because his act was held to be the effective cause of the injury caused to the other in that accident.
In the present appeal, we are dealing with facts which, not only show that a collision took place between the appellant`s car and the lorry-cum-trailer for which responsibility lay solely at the door of the appellant, but also show that, as a result of that collision, injury was caused almost immediately afterwards by the appellant to the deceased who was then stationary to his left inside that junction. The deceased may have been negligent in entering the junction when it was palpably unsafe to do so and most probably against the traffic lights but so was the appellant whose own version that he stopped in Maxwell Road until his lights turned green, that the lorry had not yet reached its own stop-line and that he then did not see the deceased, was rejected by the trial judge. On the facts accepted at the trial the appellant shot past the deceased into the lorry on a more or less parallel course and it certainly seems most unlikely that any duty of care was owed to the appellant by the deceased particularly as there is no evidence that he was aware of the presence of the appellant behind him - in fact, the appellant denied seeing him or his motorcycle there at all.
The sole question on contributory negligence which remains for consideration therefore is whether the deceased failed in his own interest to take reasonable care of himself and thereby contributed to his own injury even if he did not cause or contribute in any way to the collision between the lorry and the appellant`s car.
Cases like 
 Nance, Sigurdson 
and 
 Radburn 
are cases of direct collisions between two parties. The defendant in each case was held solely negligent and the plaintiff not guilty of any contributory negligence.
In 
 Nance`s 
case, the plaintiff was a pedestrian. In 
 Sigurdson`s 
case, the plaintiff was driving a car. The defendants in both cases were owners of street cars driven by their motormen. In 
 Radburn`s 
 case, the plaintiff was a pedal-cyclist and the defendant drove a motor car.
No third party was injured in the collisions which took place in each case.
These cases only decided the issue of contributory negligence arising for consideration on the particular set of facts established in each case.
We are not, in this appeal, concerned with a collision between two vehicles or two parties only. So far as the collision between the lorry-cum-trailer and the appellant`s car is concerned sole negligence for that collision lay with the appellant. As a result of that collision the appellant`s car spun to its right and collided with the motorcyclist who died as a consequence of the appellant`s negligence. The question is whether fault as defined under s 2 of our Contributory Negligence and Personal Injuries Act (Cap 31, 1970 Ed) lay partly with the motorcyclist so as to render the damages payable to his dependants in respect of that negligence liable to be apportioned in such a way as to reflect the deceased`s share (if any) of the responsibility for the injury to himself under that Act.
We have also considered the cases of 
 Davies v Swan Motor Co (Swansea) 
and 
 Jones v Livox Quarries 
[1952] 2 QB 608
.
In each of these two cases the question whether a third person who was injured as a result of a collision between two vehicles was guilty of contributory negligence was considered by the English Court of Appeal.
In the case of 
 Davies 
both the driver of a dust lorry and an overtaking omnibus driver were held negligent for a collision between their respective vehicles in the proportions of one to two. The question was whether the dustman who, contrary to instructions and regulations, was standing on the steps attached to the off-side of the lorry contributed to the injury to himself by so doing when the collision between the vehicles occurred. Bucknill LJ at p 312 said, `it seems to me that it is impossible to say that the dangerous position of the deceased man on the lorry had ceased to be a factor contributing to the damage that he suffered` and answered the question `Did the negligence of the deceased (dustman) right up to the moment of collision ... contribute to his injuries?` in the affirmative and reduced the damages to the plaintiff by one-fifth. Evershed LJ agreed after saying that the question was most difficult of solution. Denning LJ who gave the third judgment at p 326 said: 
 
... the first question is: What were the faults which caused the damage? The collision between the two vehicles was caused by the negligence of the two drivers: the omnibus driver because he attempted to overtake in a narrow lane on a bend, without warning and before receiving a signal; the dust lorry driver because he turned suddenly across the road without making proper use of his mirror and without giving sufficient warning of his intention to do so. But although those negligent acts were the cause of the collision, what was the cause of the damage to the deceased man? He was as the judge found, in a position which he must have known was a very dangerous position, in defiance of the dictates of common sense. If he had not been in that position, he would not have been injured. His position was certainly one of the causes of the damage just as in 
 The Margaret
the improper position of the anchor was one of the causes of the damage to the barge.
 
 
 
It should be observed that 
 The Margaret 
(1881) 6 AC 76 was a case of a direct collision between a barge which was being negligently navigated and a (stationary) schooner which was moored to a mooring buoy in the river Thames. The schooner`s anchor was hanging over its bow with the stock above water contrary to bye-laws for the navigation of the river Thames. The position of the anchor caused it to make a hole in the barge and its cargo was damaged. The damage was divided equally between the parties because both were to blame.
That was a case which, as Viscount Birkenhead said in 
 The SS Volute 
[1922] 1 AC 129
 belongs to the class of cases where: 
 
two acts (of negligence) come so closely together, and the second act of negligence 
 is so much mixed up with the state of things brought about by the first act
, that the party secondly negligent, might invoke the prior negligence as being part of the cause of the collision so as to make it a case of contribution.
 
 
 
Was the act of negligence of the deceased in entering the junction and stopping as he did to avoid the lorry a prior act of negligence which entitles the party secondly negligent (the appellant) to say that his act of negligence was so much mixed up with the state of things brought about by that prior negligence that he is entitled to invoke it as being part of the cause of his collision with the deceased so as to make it a case of contribution so far as injury to the deceased is concerned?
In the case of 
 Jones 
, the plaintiff, who rode upon the towbar at the back of a traxcavator, knowing that such conduct was dangerous and was forbidden by his employers, was held to be guilty of contributory negligence in so doing when he was crushed between the traxcavator and a dumper which negligently ran into him from the back as he stood on the towbar.
The danger of applying to the facts in the appeal before us pronouncements by the learned Lord Justices in that case is the danger that when considered out of the context of the particular facts of that case such pronouncements may seem to lend support to a finding that the deceased was guilty of contributory negligence. Singleton LJ, for example, held that Jones `put himself in a dangerous position which, in fact, exposed him to 
 the particular danger which came upon him. 
He ought not to have been there ... If he unreasonably or improperly, exposed himself 
 to this particular risk, 
I do not think that he ought to be allowed to say that it was not a cause operating to produce the damage.` Singleton LJ`s `first impression was that the fact that the plaintiff was upon the traxcavator had nothing to do with the accident. I think the real cause was the negligence of the driver of the dumper` but a little later said: 
 
Still, when one has to consider the question of contributory negligence, I do not see that it can be said that the judge was wrong in finding that the plaintiff, who deliberately put himself into a position which exposed him to this danger, was to some extent responsible for that which happened; in other words, I do not think it would be right for this court on these findings to say that the judge was wrong in law;
 
 
 
When one considers that in the 
 Davies 
and 
 Jones 
cases there was an injured person who had been forbidden to stand on the steps of the lorry in the former case and on the towbar at the back of the traxcavator in the latter case, one gets a somewhat different picture from that which emerges from the facts before us.
The similarity between the position of the deceased in this appeal and the positions of 
 Davies 
and 
 Jones 
lies in the fact that like the defendant in 
 Radburn`s 
case he had placed himself in a dangerous position inside the junction when it was unsafe to do so (and therefore negligent). He was not, however, caught in the kind of collision which took place first between two vehicles as 
 Davies 
and 
 Jones 
were. In the cases of 
 Davies 
and 
 Jones 
neither Davies nor Jones caused or contributed to the actual collisions between vehicles which took place in those cases because of their presence there. In the case of the deceased motorcyclist, similarly his presence at the scene did not cause or contribute to the collision between the lorry and the appellant`s car. The conduct of each of the three was accordingly such that it was not a cause operating to produce each of these collisions, however dangerous their positions might have been.
The question is whether the deceased, whilst stationary about three feet short of the lorry ought reasonably to have foreseen that some motorist to his right and to his rear would act as he himself had earlier done in driving into the junction when it was unsafe to do so, collide with the lorry, spin round to his right and cause him, the deceased, to suffer harm?
As Denning LJ said in the 
 Jones 
 case at p 615: 
 
A person is guilty of contributory negligence if he ought reasonably to have foreseen that if he did not act as a reasonable, prudent man, he might be hurt himself; and in his reckonings he must take into account the possibility of others being careless.
 
 
 
Does this mean, if one accepts this proposition, that the question we should ask ourselves is whether the deceased motorcyclist in entering the junction negligently ought to have foreseen that he might be hurt not only by a vehicle he could see moving lawfully inside the junction like the lorry and to take into account the possibility of carelessness on the part of such a vehicle or should we ask ourselves whether he ought to have foreseen harm to himself from vehicles generally, whether he could see them or not, which might lawfully or unlawfully enter that junction from any quarter?
It would appear that the proposition is worded in sufficiently wide terms to include the possibility of vehicles charging into the traxcavator from behind it such as the dumper in question of whose presence there is no evidence that 
 Jones 
 was ever previously aware.
If so, should we go further and ask ourselves whether the deceased ought to have foreseen possible harm to himself from the appellant`s car which overtook him on his right (even though he may not have seen it or been aware of its existence earlier) because it might hit the lorry across their paths and spin round and knock him under that lorry?
This is a difficult question to answer but it requires to be answered `somewhat broadly and upon common sense principles as a jury would probably deal with it` (see per Viscount Birkenhead in 
 The SS Volute 
[1922] 1 AC 76 at p 144).
If, to quote Denning LJ`s illustration on causation, Jones had been hit in the eye by a negligent sportsman then that would be a part of the history and would not make the plaintiffs negligence in any way a cause of that injury. The learned judge was unable to say this on the facts of the case before him, holding that the negligence of 
 Jones 
 here `was so much mixed up with his injury that it cannot be dismissed as mere history. His dangerous position on the vehicle was one of the causes of his damage just as it was in 
 Davies v Swan Motor Co (Swansea) 
`
 . 
In 
 Stapley v Gypsum Mines 
[1953] AC 681 Lord Reid said: 
 
To determine what caused an accident from the point of view of legal liability is a most difficult task. If there is any valid logical or scientific theory of causation it is quite irrelevant in this connection. In a court of law this question must be decided at a properly instructed and reasonable jury would decide it. The question must be determined by applying common sense to the facts of each particular case. One may find that as a matter of history several people have been at fault and that if any one of them had acted properly the accident would not have happened, but that does not mean that the accident must be regarded as having been caused by the faults of all of them. One must discriminate between those faults which must be discarded as being too remote and those which must not. Sometimes it is proper to discard at all but one and to regard that one as the sole cause, but in other cases it is proper to regard two or more as having jointly caused the accident. I doubt whether any test can be applied generally.
 
 
 
In the same case Lord Asquith at p 687 said: 
 
I am persuaded that it is still part of the law of this country that two causes may both be necessary pre-conditions of a particular result - damage to X - yet the one may, if the facts justify that conclusion, be treated as the real, substantial, direct or effective cause, and the other dismissed as at best a 
 causa sine qua non
 and ignored for purposes of legal liability. This is a doctrine affirmed by your Lordships` House, and not, in my view, displaced by the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945.
 
 
 
It may be pertinent also to consider the following passage from Lord Atkins judgment in 
 Caswell v Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries 
[1940] AC 164 at p 164: 
 
But the injury may be the result of two causes operating at the same time, a breach of duty by the defendant and the omission on the part of the plaintiff to use the ordinary care for the protection of himself or his property that is used by the ordinary reasonable man in those circumstances. In that case the plaintiff cannot recover because the injury is partly caused by what is imputed to him as his own default. On the other hand if the plaintiff were negligent but his negligence was not a cause operating to produce the damage there would be no defence. I find it impossible to divorce any theory of contributory negligence from the concept of causation. It is negligence which `contributes to cause` the injury, a phrase which I take from the opinion of Lord Penzance in 
 Radley v London and North Western Ry Co
. And whether you ask whose negligence was responsible for the injury, or from whose negligence did the injury result, or adopt any other phrase you please, you must in the ultimate analysis be asking who `caused` the injury; and you must not be deterred because the word `cause` has in philosophy given rise to embarrassments which in this connection should not affect the judge.
 
 
 
In our view, the act of the deceased in entering the junction and stopping as he did was not the kind of prior act of negligence which entitles the appellant who was the party secondly negligent to say that his act was `so much mixed up with the state of things brought about by the first act` that he is entitled to invoke it as part of the cause of his colliding with the lorry so as to make it a case of contribution on the part of the deceased with whom he subsequently collided. The facts in 
 The 
 
 SS Volute 
case showed clear negligence on the part of both vessels in relation to each other. In the present appeal, there was no act of negligence on the part of the deceased which caused the appellant to be secondly negligent.
The cases of 
 Davies 
and 
 Jones 
relate to passengers who exposed themselves to particular risks which they could have reasonably foreseen when they took up their positions on their respective vehicles after being forbidden to do so and thereby contributed to their own injuries.
With regard to Denning LJ`s proposition earlier cited from the 
 Jones 
 case we are of the view that the question we should ask ourselves and which we do is whether the deceased ought reasonably to have foreseen that he might be hurt not only by vehicles such as the lorry in particular which he could see lawfully moving inside the junction but also by vehicles unlawfully entering the junction like the appellant? We would answer this question in the negative.
As to the further question whether he ought reasonably have foreseen harm to himself from the appellant we are satisfied that the answer is again in the negative.
There is no evidence that the deceased was negligent in relation to the appellant so as to make that negligence a prior act which contributed to cause the injury he sustained. The second act of negligence on the part of the appellant was independent of the first act and was not brought about by it. The negligence of the deceased was in relation to vehicles like the lorry which had lawfully entered the junction, in the first place, which the appellant obviously had not.
Having jerked to a stop, there was practically no risk to which the deceased exposed himself as there was no other traffic lawfully moving in that junction besides the lorry. So far as the evidence shows and, as the trial judge found, all other traffic was at a standstill except for the appellant who entered the junction unlawfully after the deceased on a parallel course but to his right and to his rear. The deceased could not have reasonably anticipated the action of the appellant in overtaking him and hitting the towbar of the lorry. Nor could he have foreseen that the appellant`s car would spin round and knock him under the trailer. Further, this was not a consequence in the chain of causation which he ought to have foreseen.
We appreciate that the position in which the deceased placed himself in that junction after entering it unlawfully may seem to be a potent factor showing want of care on his part towards lawful users of that junction. The appellant was not such a person. But it does not prove, as the appellant is obliged to do in this appeal, that the deceased did not in his own interest take reasonable care of himself.
After anxious consideration of the difficult questions arising out of the facts in this appeal we have arrived at the conclusion that the real, substantial and effective cause of the death of the deceased was the appellant`s sole negligence in hitting the lorry with his car which spun to its right and killed him, a fact which the deceased could not reasonably have foreseen. In any event, the trial judge came to the conclusion that the appellant was solely to blame and that the deceased was not guilty of contributory negligence. Adopting the language of the Privy Council in 
 Sigurdson`s 
 case the trial judge was entitled to come to that conclusion, taking a broad view of the case as a whole.
We would accordingly dismiss the appeal with costs.

2nd Charge: are charged that you, on or about 9 December 1993 at 9 Battery Road, #09-08/10, Straits Trading Building, Singapore, being an agent, to wit, a director of Vigers Singapore Pte Ltd and in such capacity being entrusted with property, to wit, funds belonging to Vigers Singapore Pte Ltd, committed criminal breach of trust by dishonestly misappropriating $1,000 in respect of the said property, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 409 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
He was sentenced to three weeks` imprisonment on the first charge and to three months` imprisonment on the second charge. Both terms were ordered to run concurrently. The appellant appealed against both his conviction and sentence. I heard his appeal on both charges, on 15 April 1997. After listening to arguments by counsel for the appellant, I dismissed the appeal. I now give my reasons.
 The agreed statement of facts
The prosecution and the defence agreed on a statement of facts at the trial below, as set out hereafter. On 15 June 1993, the appellant was appointed as the managing director (MD) of Vigers Singapore. Sloan Management Services (Sloan) was registered as a business on 26 May 1991 and was at all times a sole proprietorship in the appellant`s wife`s name. Sloan was in fact, managed by the appellant.
The appellant`s brother, one Georges Tan Choo Hock (Georges), was in 1993 the managing partner of Resource Pool Business Services (RPBS), which provided consultancy business services.
Georges sent an RPBS invoice dated 2 July 1993 to Vigers Singapore for $500, for `company secretarial services rendered for the period from April 1993 to June 1993`. On or about 7 July 1993, the appellant issued a cheque dated the same day for $500 drawn on Vigers Singapore`s account to RPBS.
Georges sent a second RPBS invoice dated 2 December 1993 to Vigers Singapore for $1,000 for `company secretarial services rendered for the period from 1 June 1993 to 31 December 1993`. On or about 9 December 1993, the appellant issued a cheque dated 9 December 1993 for $1,000 drawn on Vigers Singapore`s account, again to RPBS.
Subsequently, Sloan issued an invoice to RPBS dated 5 December 1993 for $1,350 for `consultancy services rendered for the three quarters ended 31 December 1993`. On 6 January 1994, Georges issued a cheque for $1,350 drawn on the account of RPBS to Sloan
 The background
In 1992, one Lee Zee Ming (Lee) and the appellant approached Tan Kim Lee (Tan), the former MD of Vigers Singapore to purchase all of his 62% shareholding in the company. The price offered for Tan`s shares was $170,000. After negotiations, Lee and the appellant entered into a sale and purchase agreement dated 25 February 1993, with Tan, Vigers Asia (Holdings) Ltd of Hong Kong and Vigers Singapore, for the sale of shares, to be transferred on 15 April 1993.
 The arrangement
Subsequently, the appellant and Lee had a few meetings with Tan. According to the appellant and Tan, both the appellant and Lee had complained that the secretarial fees charged by Lim and Associates, a secretarial firm, were excessive. Lee, however, maintained that he did not look at the January or February 1993 management accounts of the company and therefore, he did not know that Vigers Singapore was paying Lim and Associates $4,000 for nine months` secretarial work and therefore denied ever complaining about the fees.
According to the appellant, Lee had wanted an arrangement for cheaper secretarial fees. The appellant had experience in company secretarial work. The appellant maintained that he told Lee that he would do the company secretarial work at around half the cost. However, at that time, the appellant was in employment elsewhere, as company secretary at Chemical Industries. As such, according to the appellant, he could not be the company secretary, since he could not be an employee of two different companies. It appeared however, that the appellant was involved in Sloan at the same time as he was secretary of Chemical Industries. The appellant explained this by saying that `Sloan was a $2 paid up company and was dormant`. In any event, the appellant maintained that he told Lee that he would get his brother`s firm RPSB to provide a named company secretary and then RPSB could bill Vigers Singapore. Lee however denied all of this.
The appellant`s brother, Georges, testified that in March 1993 the appellant approached him and proposed that RPBS be appointed the company secretary of Vigers Singapore; that `RPBS would not perform all the secretarial services`; that RPBS provide the registered address of Vigers Singapore and that RPBS provide a named company secretary. According to Georges, he would normally have given the secretarial services to the affiliate company of RPBS. However, at the appellant`s request, RPBS agreed to sub-contract the company secretarial services to Sloan. RPBS was to retain $200 as consideration for providing the office address and naming the company secretary.
Therefore, in fact, the appellant was being paid for his secretarial services through RPBS as a sub-contractor. The appellant maintained that the $500 paid for secretarial services for April and June 1993 was for the period when the appellant was not a shareholder of the company and was not receiving remuneration at all as employee or officer of Vigers Singapore. There was no agreement between the appellant and Lee that he was going to do the secretarial work for free.
As for the $1,000 for secretarial services from June to December 1993, the appellant maintained that he was not responsible `for the actual corporate secretarial work like preparing the resolutions, lodging of ROC forms and the updating of company records`. As he had done such work without being responsible for them, the appellant therefore felt that he just `received a percentage of what RPBS got`.
The appellant agreed however that, after he became Vigers Singapore`s director, no resolution was passed to approve the arrangement whereby he would do Vigers Singapore`s secretarial work which RPBS had contracted to Sloan and he would bill RPBS through Sloan.
According to Lee, the appellant and himself had a verbal agreement after signing the agreement of 25 February 1993 as to their defined areas of responsibilities and the demarcation of their roles and duties. Lee knew that the appellant was a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Secretaries and a Certified Public Accountant and he had been the group company secretary of two large publicly listed companies. Therefore, it was verbally agreed that, by the time they became directors of Vigers Singapore, the appellant would be given the responsibilities for company secretarial work, accounts matters, administration and estate agency.
Lee agreed that there was no discussion that the appellant would do secretarial work for free in April and June 1993. However, by 25 February 1993, it was already decided that the appellant would be shareholder and director of Vigers Singapore and therefore he had a vested interest in the company. There was no discussion that the appellant would be separately paid for his secretarial work. Lee maintained that the appellant`s high pay already included payment for secretarial work.
 The directors` resolution
There was a directors` resolution dated 1 April 1993. In this resolution, one Chin Yan Kee (Chin) was appointed as the new company secretary and the address of the registered office was changed from the address of Lim and Associates to that of RPBS, the appellant`s brother`s firm. Lee denied that this resolution was the result of discussions he and the appellant had with Tan in March 1993. Although Lee signed the resolution, he maintained that the appellant had given him a stack of documents and he had signed it without looking at its contents, because the appellant was then doing the secretarial work of Vigers Singapore and he trusted the appellant. It was undisputed that Lee did not know Chin. Therefore, Lee testified that he would not have approved Chin`s nomination, if he had been aware of it, since his post involved dealing with confidential matters of the company.
 `Concealment` of the secretarial fees
Francis Lee (Francis) kept and maintained Vigers Singapore`s accounting records and prepared its financial statements and management accounts. Francis did not discuss with or report to Lee on the accounts; he reported directly to the appellant. Lee always left the accounting matters to the appellant.
Francis had testified that in March 1994 he had seen the appellant with the draft management accounts, which included the profit and loss accounts for the period from 1 July 1993 to 28 February 1994. The appellant had instructed Francis to reclassify the sum for secretarial expenses under general expenses. He had also instructed Francis to separate the entertainment and refreshment accounts.
According to Francis, `General expenses actually is a dummy account usually including expenses paid out in small amounts or are not incurred frequently`. A person looking at the item would not know what the expenses included under general expenses were, unless he referred to the records or asked Francis about the details. Francis gave evidence that he would not normally classify secretarial fees under general expenses but that he had done so upon the appellant`s specific instructions. He however, did not consider the instruction as improper. The appellant testified that he did the reclassification because he wanted to make the profit and loss account less detailed
The invoices from RPBS to Vigers Singapore had accurately described the billing as being for `company secretarial work`. However, when the appellant billed RPBS, the invoice from Sloan described the work as `consultancy services`. There had also been an AGM of Vigers Singapore. Georges was meant to attend the meeting but arrived only after the meeting. Yet his name appeared as the recording secretary on the attendance sheet for the AGM.
Prosecution alleged that the reclassification ordered by the appellant as well as the different description on the invoice from Sloan were to conceal the fact that secretarial fees were being paid by Vigers Singapore and to dissociate Sloan and himself from the payments made to RPBS from Vigers Singapore. Further, the allegation pertaining to the AGM attendance sheet was that the appellant did it to give the impression that Georges was doing work for Vigers Singapore, thereby justifying the payment to RPBS.
 Refusal to sign the accounts
Frederick Lee (Frederick), Lee`s brother, joined Vigers Singapore on 23 February 1994. From July 1994, the relationship between the appellant, and Lee and Frederick was strained. There had been many disagreements between them concerning the management of the company. Another reason was the appellant`s questioning of Lee`s intention to increase Frederick`s salary. As a result of this `strain` in their relationship, it was decided that either the appellant should buy over all their shares or he sells his shares in Vigers Singapore to them. On 1 August 1994, the appellant decided to sell his shares to Lee and Frederick.
On 15 August 1994, the appellant tendered his resignation and he backdated this notice to 1 August 1994, the date when he sold all his shares and stated that the resignation was to take effect from 31 August 1994. A day after the appellant`s resignation, Lee called the appellant and suggested that Francis be asked to finalise the accounts and to call the auditors to audit the accounts. He requested the appellant to sign the audited accounts together with him as directors, since Frederick was new and would not know about the accounts for that period. The appellant refused to sign the accounts and this made Lee suspicious. Frederick initiated an internal audit and `discovered a lot of irregularities in the accounts `. According to Lee, through this internal audit, they discovered that the appellant made use of company funds to pay himself, using RPBS as a vehicle to receive payment.
 The trial judge`s findings
The trial judge found as a fact that there was no agreement by the directors of Vigers Singapore, particularly Lee and the director representing Vigers Asia, to contract out the company`s secretarial work to RPBS or to the appellant. He found that there was no documentary evidence of any agreement to pay the appellant for the secretarial work. He also felt that, even though Lee`s signature was on the director`s resolution, Lee had signed it `blindly` since he trusted the appellant with the secretarial matters especially as at the material time, he was `overwhelmed with work`.
The trial judge also found that undoubtedly, the appellant had done the secretarial work for Vigers Singapore but he admitted that this had benefited him as its shareholder and director. It was already agreed that he was responsible for company secretarial work before he joined Vigers Singapore as a full time director. His high remuneration was also for the secretarial work which he already did for Vigers Singapore prior to joining the company as a full-time director. He found that there was no document to evidence the defence case that the appellant should bill Vigers Singapore through RPBS.
The trial judge next found that, if the appellant did not want to be named as the secretary, but there was an agreement by the other directors that he would be paid for his secretarial work, he could have been paid through his firm Sloan by Vigers Singapore. There was no necessity to have RPBS in the scheme merely for the payment of the fees for his secretarial work. He thought that the use of RPBS `smacked of a deliberate device to conceal the wrongful payments of the appellant to himself`. He felt that there was no sense in using Vigers Singapore`s registered address merely to receive correspondence and to pass them to Vigers Singapore`s office, without any work being done by RPBS on the correspondence received. Therefore he felt that the introduction of RPBS`s address as Vigers Singapore`s registered address appeared to be another device to deceive Vigers Singapore. He believed Lee signed the documents without scrutiny because he was busy and he had trusted the appellant.
The trial judge felt that the reclassification exercise which the appellant instructed Francis on had the effect of concealing the payments from the attention of Lee, Frederick and also Vigers Asia. He felt that another questionable act of the appellant was to mis-state in his invoice from Sloan to RPBS, that the work which he had provided to them was `consultancy services` when RPBS had accurately described the same work as `company secretarial work` in their bills to Vigers Singapore. He found that no reasonable explanation was given and it could be reasonably inferred that the appellant did not want the billing by and payment to Sloan to be traced to the payments to RPBS from Vigers Singapore. He also inferred that, by allowing the AGM minutes to reflect that Georges was in attendance and was the recording secretary, the appellant wanted to create the impression that RPBS did carry out secretarial work for which payment was due.
The trial judge found the appellant to be evasive on several occasions and he felt that the various material inconsistencies in his own evidence and the contradictions between his evidence and the evidence of Tan, made the defence version highly suspect. On the other hand, he found Lee to be a truthful witness and ruled that his credit was not impeached.
 The motion to admit fresh evidence
In this appeal, counsel for the appellant filed a motion to admit fresh evidence before me. The fresh evidence was copies of two letters. The first, `TTC-1` was a copy of a letter from Lee writing for himself and on behalf of the appellant to Mr Gareth Williams dated 19 March 1993. Mr Williams was then a director of Vigers Asia Holdings. The second, `TTC-2` was a copy of a letter from Michael Mann to Vigers Singapore, dated 26 March 1993. Michael Mann was then also a director of Vigers Asia Holdings. The letter was a reply to the first letter, on behalf of Mr Williams.
In his first affidavit in support of the motion, the appellant (the applicant in the motion) submitted that the first letter showed that Lee knew about the company secretarial fees of $4,000 for nine months, at the material time and that he regarded it as `high by local standards`. It was alleged that the letter showed that Lee was a party to the suggestion that the secretarial fees be reduced to half the cost. As for the second letter, it was submitted that it showed that the directors of Vigers Asia had no objections. Therefore, the letters effectively were to attack Lee`s credibility.
 The applicable principles
The principles governing an application to adduce fresh evidence on appeal are set out in 
 Juma`at bin Samad v PP 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 338
 and 
 Carl Elias v PP 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 501
, adopting 
 Ladd v Marshall 
[1954] 3 All ER 745. Briefly, first, it must be shown that the evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial; secondly, the evidence must be such that, if given at the trial, it would probably have an important influence on the result of the case, although it need not be decisive; and thirdly, the evidence must be apparently credible although it need not be incontrovertible.
 The present motion
Applying the principles above to the present case, the correspondence here occurred in March 1993. Therefore, it definitely was in existence at the time of the trial. In the appellant`s affidavit, he did not give a good explanation as to why the letters could not have been made available during the trial below. The burden is on the appellant to show that the evidence was not available at the time of the trial. I was not satisfied that the burden here had been discharged.
Having said that, in 
 Juma`at bin Samad 
, I stated the following: 
 
It is true that there are situations where the court would allow additional evidence to be called even though it could not be strictly said that the evidence was not available at the time of trial, if it can be shown that a miscarriage of justice has resulted. The core principle of s 257 CPC after all, is that additional evidence may be taken if it is necessary in the interests of justice. That said, it must be emphasised in no uncertain terms that such a situation will arise only in the most extraordinary circumstances.
 
 
 
I was not convinced that this was one of those limited instances where it was in the interests of justice to admit the evidence.
There was also doubt as to the credibility of the two letters, considering that the trial judge had found that Lee had signed the director`s resolution `blindly` as he trusted the appellant with the secretarial matters. In Lee`s affidavit in reply, in this motion, Lee had explained that he had similarly signed this letter without looking at the contents as he trusted the appellant. I saw no reason to disagree with the trial judge`s finding on this point. Therefore, the natural inference was that the appellant could have similarly signed `blindly` here.
On the whole, I was of the view that the application to allow the fresh evidence should not be allowed, and accordingly dismissed the motion.
 The appeal
Under s 409 of the Penal Code (Cap 224), the appellant had to be (a) entrusted with the property, and he had to have (b) dishonestly misappropriated the property. In this case, (a) was clearly satisfied. It was undisputed evidence that from 1 July 1993, the appellant was signing cheques on behalf of Vigers Singapore without consulting Lee. The appeal here was centered on the vital issue of whether (b) was satisfied.
 Misappropriation
To `misappropriate` means to set apart or assign to the wrong person or wrong use, and this must be done dishonestly. Setting aside property by one person for the use of another other than himself and the true owner can also constitute misappropriation; see 
 Tan Sri Tan Hian Tsin v PP 
 
[1979] 1 MLJ 73
 where criminal breach of trust was committed by the MD of the company which paid money into the bank account of another company of which he and his wife were the sole shareholders. Therefore, in this case, setting aside property for the appellant as well as his brother`s firm could both constitute misappropriation.
Therefore, the first issue I had to consider was whether the $1,500 was assigned to the wrong person or for the wrong use. This would turn on whether the appellant was rightfully entitled to the money. This in turn would depend on whether all the directors of Vigers Singapore knew and approved of the arrangement, whereby the appellant would be paid, through RPBS, for secretarial services rendered and RPBS would be paid for nominating the company secretary, as well as providing its address to serve as Vigers Singapore`s registered address. If they did, then it would appear that he had earned the money and was paid with Vigers Singapore`s authority.
 Did the directors know about the arrangement?
At the material time, the directors were Lee, Tan and a representative from Vigers Asia. The evidence before me showed that there was a conflict of testimony between Lee on the one side, and on the other, the appellant and Tan. The trial judge accepted Lee`s evidence on this point. Even though Tan`s evidence corroborated the appellant`s evidence on this point, the trial judge felt that Tan was a biased witness as he appeared to have gone out of his way to assist in the appellant`s defence. Also, Tan had left Vigers Singapore under `unhappy circumstances` and there was also a pending suit by Vigers Singapore and Lee against Tan on matters involving the company. Therefore the trial judge felt that he was a biased witness who had an `axe to grind against Vigers Singapore and Lee`.
The trial judge also found that Tan`s evidence actually contradicted the appellant`s evidence that the discussion about the high secretarial fees took place in early March 1993, sometime after 25 February 1993, when the agreement was signed. This was since Tan said that he told William Garett, the alternate director for Michael Mann (the Hong Kong director of Vigers Asia), about the arrangement concerning RPBS before 25 February 1993. It would seem odd that Tan could have told William Garett about the arrangement then, in Singapore, when the discussion only took place in March 1993, especially since, by March 1993, William Garett had already departed for Hong Kong. The trial judge noted that the material contradiction made the defence version `highly suspect`.
I fully agreed with the trial judge`s findings. Counsel for the appellant contended that the trial judge failed to consider that Tan`s evidence corroborated the appellant`s, in that Lee knew about the arrangement with RPBS. In my opinion, the trial judge could not possibly have considered Tan`s evidence as corroboration, when, after assessing Tan`s evidence, he found that he lacked credibility. The trial judge also found that Tan prevaricated on various other matters. Based on this, it was no surprise that he chose to treat Tan`s evidence with caution, and did not rely on it.
In this case, there was also no documentary evidence of the arrangement, as there was no resolution on this matter. In an earlier incident, the appellant had drafted a resolution and obtained approval for an increase in his salary. This, in my view, showed that the appellant was generally a cautious man when it came to his remuneration. Therefore, I would think it odd that a man with his qualifications and vast experience, failed to officially document the arrangement, especially when it involved him receiving a monetary benefit from the company.
The only evidence that could possibly indicate that Lee and Michael Mann, the Hong Kong director of Vigers Asia, knew about the arrangement was the fact that they both signed the resolution to appoint Chin as the new secretary and also to change the registered address of the company to RPBS`s address. Lee`s explanation was that he was `overwhelmed with work` then and he just signed it, as he trusted the appellant. As for Michael Mann, there was no evidence as to why he signed it. From the evidence before me, it appeared that the Hong Kong office left the day to day running of the company to the directors in Singapore. Therefore, it could be reasonably inferred that Michael Mann would not have had many queries pertaining to a new appointment and a change of the registered address.
The next question then for me to consider was whether Lee really did sign the resolution `blindly`. Counsel for the appellant submitted that it was unlikely that Lee who was high in the hierarchy would just sign without scrutiny since Lee was a very cautious man. It was undisputed that Lee did not know who Chin was. The evidence was that Lee had not asked the appellant any questions concerning the resolution. I would think that, Lee would surely have asked about Chin and the change of address, if he was aware of the contents. This was since Lee had testified that he would surely have queried Chin`s appointment as his position involved dealing with the company`s confidential matters. As for the address, Lee had said that he felt that there was no need for it, since Vigers Singapore was a `viable working company`, which could use its own address.
If it were true that Lee was a very cautious man, as counsel for the appellant stressed, he would surely have queried the appellant on these matters, before signing the resolution. Also, it could be inferred that Lee generally left all the accounting and secretarial matters to the appellant, from the fact that the appellant could sign cheques without consulting Lee.
In addition, it was undisputed that Lee had known the appellant since the 1960s. They studied together in school and university, were colleagues at the Inland Revenue Department and then together they acquired their respective shareholdings in Vigers to work for a common objective. In my opinion, it was not inconceivable that, with such a background, Lee had placed so much trust in the appellant, that he had signed the resolution `blindly`. Therefore, in my view, the trial judge was right in finding that the directors had not agreed to contract out the company`s secretarial work to RPBS, as they had no knowledge of the `alleged` arrangement.
 Dishonesty
As the directors had not approved the arrangement, the appellant was not rightfully entitled to the money. However, a further issue I had to consider was whether the appellant had a dishonest intention in making the payments. This had to be determined with reference to s 24 of the Penal Code. Dishonesty may be established by showing that the appellant had done acts `with the intention of causing wrongful gain to one person, or wrongful loss to another person`. The concepts of `wrongful gain` or `wrongful loss` have to be examined with s 23 of the Penal Code in mind. Essentially, this is whether there was gain (or loss) by unlawful means, of property, to which the person gaining (losing) it is not legally entitled, or is legally entitled, as the case may be.
Further, in 
 Ang Teck Hwa v PP 
 [1988] 1 Mlj 279 at p 284, the court stated: 
 
to show dishonesty, it must be shown that the appellants 
 intended
 to cause such wrongful gain/loss. To intend a wrongful gain/loss requires that one knows the gain/loss is wrongful. Thus if the appellant made use of the $5,819.80 for his own purposes knowing that he was not entitled to do so, then he would be doing so with the intention of causing wrongful gain to himself and wrongful loss to SLF. Conversely if the appellant can show that he did so honestly believing that he was legally entitled to do, then he could not be said to have acted dishonestly.
 
 
 
I had to consider whether the appellant here showed that he made the payments on behalf of Vigers Singapore to RPBS, honestly believing he was legally entitled to do so, and also whether in receiving the payments, he honestly thought that he was legally entitled to payment for his services through RPBS, as a `sub-contractor`. If he did so, then there would have been no dishonesty on his part.
I felt that this had to be determined with reference to his actions and the surrounding circumstances. In this case, there were five prime areas which required consideration, as follows: 
(a) the `concealment` of the payment of the secretarial fees; 
(b) the disguise of the payments to Sloan; 
(c) the false entry in the AGM attendance sheet; 
(d) the need for RPBS`s services; and 
(e) the appellant`s right to be paid
 The `concealment` of the payment of the secretarial fees
It was undisputed that the appellant had instructed Francis to reclassify the secretarial fees under general expenses. The appellant had testified that he had done this because he did not want the profit and loss account to be so detailed. His explanation was that showing small items or small values would make the accounts confusing. It was also undisputed, however, that the appellant had also asked Francis to split up the item `refreshment` from `entertainment` although the amount under `refreshment` then was very much smaller than the amount under `secretarial fees`
I was of the opinion that his explanation was unbelievable, since he contradicted his reason for reclassifying the secretarial fees by his other instruction to Francis. By splitting `refreshment` from `entertainment`, which were `small items` and `small values`, he was making the profit and loss account more detailed. This totally contradicted his explanation for reclassifying the secretarial fees. The irresistible inference, which was the same inference the trial judge drew, was that the purpose of the reclassification exercise was to conceal the payments, as any person looking at the profit and loss account would not know that Vigers Singapore had to pay and was paying secretarial fees.
Counsel for the appellant argued that the respondent had not tendered any evidence that the payment of $500 in July 1993 was `concealed` in any manner. His argument was that, if the appellant intended to conceal the payments, why did he only reclassify the $1,000? Counsel further submitted that the appellant had no reason to `conceal` the payments in the profit and loss account, since it was undisputed that Lee left all the accounting matters to the appellant, and the appellant knew that Lee was only interested in the bottom line figure.
I rejected counsel`s argument, as being superficial. Looking at the facts purely on the surface, it would appear that counsel`s argument does start one wondering. However, on a close analysis of the facts, there is a valid explanation for the appellant`s actions. It must not be forgotten that there was actually a third person in the picture, namely, Frederick, Lee`s brother. It was interesting to note that the reclassification of the $1,000 was carried out at the time when Lee`s brother, Frederick was to join Vigers Singapore. As the trial judge said: 
 
It could not be mere coincidence that the [appellant`s] instruction to [Francis] to reclassify the secretarial fees transpired at the time when [Frederick] became a full-time director of Vigers Singapore in February 1994. [Lee], known to the [appellant] for 30 years as a former school mate and colleague, had not bothered to inquire about the invoices, payment vouchers and accounts relating to the secretarial fees, but [Frederick] was an unknown quantity to the [appellant] when he joined Vigers Singapore in February 1994.
 
 
 
I noted that the payment of the $500 was for secretarial services rendered for the period from April 1993 to June 1993, whereas the payment of $1,000 was for the period from 1 June 1993 to 31 December 1993. The profit and loss accounts which were modified were for the period from 1 July 1993 to 28 February 1994. This would mean that the payment of the $500 would have been reflected in the profit and loss account for the previous financial period. Frederick was not on the scene then, as he only joined Vigers on 23 February 1994. The payment of the $1,000 however had to be reflected in the relevant profit and loss account. The appellant instructed Francis to do the reclassification in March 1994. By then, Frederick was already a full-time director and it can be inferred that the appellant was unsure whether Frederick would similarly leave all the accounting matters to him.
 The disguise of the payments to Sloan
It was also undisputed that, even though the invoices from RPBS had accurately described the billing as being for `company secretarial work`, when the appellant had billed RPBS, the invoice from Sloan described the same work as `consultancy services`. The respondent`s contention was that the appellant was trying to hide the fact that he or Sloan was to receive payment for the secretarial work assigned to RPBS. The appellant had reiterated, by saying that if he wanted to hide anything, he could just have asked his brother to pay him in cash.
I did not think that the appellant could have done that, since his brother, Georges had testified that he would have deemed the arrangement improper if there was merely cash payment without any documentation. Counsel for the appellant submitted that even if the invoice from Sloan had described the work as `consultancy services`, the invoices billed to RPBS were properly reflected and transparent, as they were titled `secretarial services`. Therefore, his argument was that, if Lee looked at them, he would still know that the company was incurring secretarial fees, notwithstanding the fact that the item was not reflected in the profit and loss account.
I did not accept this argument. I did not think it unlikely that the appellant was a fairly capable man, who had thought about the plan very carefully. As mentioned earlier, I felt that the appellant tried to conceal the payments in the profit and loss statement to make it appear that no secretarial fees were being incurred. However, from the evidence, it can be seen that the appellant created some safeguards for himself. This was in the event that someone went through the invoices and discovered that payments were made to RPBS. Should this happen, the appellant did certain things, which I shall proceed to consider below, to give the impression that RPBS really did the secretarial work, and was therefore justified in receiving payment.
In my view, the appellant was trying to dissociate himself and Sloan from the payments which he had made on behalf of Vigers Singapore to RPBS. He did this by heading the invoice from Sloan to RPBS as `consultancy services`, so that it would not be obvious that the payment from RPBS to Sloan and, therefore, himself was the same payment from Vigers Singapore to RPBS. In my opinion, the fact that the invoices were properly reflected did not carry much weight.
 The false entry on the AGM attendance sheet
It was undisputed that Georges`s signature was on the AGM attendance sheet, as the recording secretary, even though he came only after the meeting was over. The trial judge inferred, that by allowing the minutes to reflect that his brother was in attendance and that he was the recording secretary, the appellant had wanted to create the impression that RPBS did carry out secretarial work, for which payment was due.
I was unsure as to the correctness of the trial judge`s finding on this point. I noted that Lee actually knew Georges. Since Lee was present at the meeting, surely he would have known that Georges was not present. In any event, I felt that the appellant did this to safeguard himself, in the event that someone else like Frederick looked at the minutes. If Frederick had looked at the invoices from RPBS to Vigers Singapore and realised that Vigers Singapore was paying RPBS for secretarial services, he would surely have queries as to what work RPBS did for Vigers Singapore. By looking at the AGM attendance sheet, he would think that RPBS really did secretarial work for Vigers and therefore payment to RPBS would seem justified. This was consistent with his plan.
 The need for RPBS`s services
I could not see a need for RPBS to nominate the company secretary, and be paid for it. The appellant had testified that he did not want to be named as Vigers Singapore`s secretary as he did not want his employers Chemical Industries to know about it. However, it was undisputed that, at the same time he was secretary at Chemical Industries, he was also secretary at Sloan. Even though the appellant had explained this by saying that Sloan was a $2 paid-up company and was dormant, the trial judge was not convinced, as he found that the appellant had prevaricated on his answers as to whether Sloan was really a dormant company. Hence, the trial judge felt that the appellant`s reason for not wanting to be named as Vigers Singapore`s secretary, `would not therefore hold water`. He further said that the fact that Sloan had only $2 paid-up capital should be irrelevant. In the circumstances, I saw no reason to fault the trial judge`s finding.
In any event, this arrangement continued even after he left Chemical Industries. I felt that the reason he gave, that he did not want to abandon his brother, despite the fact that he could act as secretary, was totally devoid of merit.
I could also see no need to use RPBS as the registered address, as Vigers Singapore could have used its own address, since in Lee`s words it was a `viable working company`. I agreed with the trial judge that there was no sense in using RPBS as Vigers Singapore`s registered address, merely to receive correspondence and to pass them to Vigers Singapore`s office, without any work being done by RPBS, on the correspondence received.
This again, was consistent with the appellant`s plan. Allowing RPBS to name the nominee secretary and provide a registered address was merely to justify payment to RPBS, should there be queries as to the work that RPBS did. In any event, if there was an agreement by the other directors that he would be paid for the secretarial work, he could have been paid through Sloan by Vigers Singapore directly. I could not see why there was a need to have RPBS in the scheme, merely for the payment of the fees for his secretarial work. In these circumstances, clearly the trial judge was entitled to find that the use of RPBS was a deliberate device to conceal the wrongful payments of the appellant to himself, from Vigers Singapore`s funds.
 The appellant`s right to be paid
Finally, I had to consider whether the appellant really believed that he should be paid, since, if he did, he would not have been dishonest. It was undisputed that the appellant did the secretarial work. However, as mentioned, there was a demarcation of duties, with the appellant being responsible for the company secretarial work. It was undisputed that there was no agreement that the appellant should do the work for free.
The $500 was allegedly paid for secretarial services for April and June 1993. At that time, the appellant had not joined the company yet. The appellant became a non-executive director on 15 April 1993 and managing director on 15 June 1993. The appellant only became a full-time managing director of Vigers Singapore on 1 July 1993. The appellant had initiated a resolution to increase his remuneration as director to $8,000 on 1 July 1993
A person who does work normally expects to be paid for it. Therefore, counsel for the appellant had submitted that since, at that time, the appellant was not yet in the employment of Vigers Singapore, he had a right to be paid for the services rendered. In this case, however, I felt that it was perfectly reasonable for the appellant to have done the work without expecting to be paid, as he was already a shareholder of Vigers Singapore and was going to be a director. Therefore, he had a vested interest in the company. Faced with the evidence, the trial judge drew a reasonable inference that the appellant was doing the work, which due to the verbal agreement on the demarcation of duties, was under his domain anyway, as this benefited him. There was after all no agreement that he was going to be paid. With the appellant`s vast experience, he would surely know that, as he was a non-executive director at the material time, if he was going to receive remuneration, there would need to be a company resolution to that effect.
If the appellant had genuinely thought he was entitled to be paid, why did he do everything surreptitiously? If he had felt that he was entitled to be paid for the work done, he should have made all the other directors aware of the payment to him. After all, any ordinary person is likely to make full disclosure of such matters, to avoid being swamped with allegations in the future. Even if a person thinks that he is entitled to something, it does not entitle him to take it, without obtaining the owner`s permission. Similarly, in this case, the appellant was not entitled to the $500, without the permission of Vigers Singapore, namely, the board of directors of Vigers.
As for the $1,000, the appellant seemed to make a distinction as to what sort of work came under corporate secretarial work. He appeared to say that although he had the overall charge of corporate secretarial work, he did not have to do the actual corporate secretarial work, like preparing resolutions and updating records. Since he did such work, he felt that he deserved to be paid for it. I thought that this argument was very weak and I saw no merit in it. The $1,000 was allegedly for secretarial work done from July to December 1993. During this time, the appellant was already managing director at Vigers Singapore. He was already receiving remuneration of $8,000. I entirely agreed with the trial judge`s finding that his high salary included the company secretarial work, which he was meant to do according to the demarcation of responsibilities anyway. There was no evidence that he was to be paid separately for the work he did and I saw no reason why he should have been.
From the evidence above, it was a natural inference that the appellant knew that the gain to himself and RPBS with the loss to Vigers Singapore was wrongful. The appellant was well acquainted and experienced with company matters and knew the regulations observed by companies. In my opinion, the appellant could only have acted the way he did, because he knew that his actions were wrongful and he was trying to conceal them. The appellant therefore, intended to cause the wrongful gain and loss and therefore, dishonesty was certainly present in this case. In fact, the appellant`s actions also amounted to putting the interest of himself and his brother over that of the company, and his actions constituted a breach of fiduciary duties. This alone was insufficient to be the basis of a conviction under s 409 of the Penal Code: see 
 Cheam Tat Pang v PP 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 541
. However, in this case, it was evident that the appellant`s actions went beyond a mere breach of fiduciary duty.
 Conclusion
On the whole, I was satisfied that the charge under s 409 of the Penal Code had been proved against the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt. I did not find any merit in the contentions raised on appeal. As for the sentence imposed, I did not find it manifestly excessive and I was not convinced by counsel`s submissions for a reduction of the sentence. For these reasons, I dismissed the appeal without finding it necessary to hear the deputy public prosecutor.

Introduction
1       Suit No 311 of 2015 (“Suit 311/2015”) centres on the untimely passing of full-time national serviceman Lee Rui Feng Dominique Lee Sarron (“Mr Lee”) shortly after a military training exercise on 17 April 2012 (“the Exercise”).
2       The plaintiff is the estate of Mr Lee. On 1 April 2015, the plaintiff commenced an action against Najib Hanuk bin Muhammad Jalal, the first defendant (“D1”), Chia Thye Siong, the second defendant (“D2”), and the Attorney-General, the third defendant (“the AG”). D1 and D2 are full-time Singapore Armed Forces (“SAF”) officers who were involved in the Exercise. The AG was joined as a party to the proceedings by virtue of s 19(3) of the Government Proceedings Act (Cap 121, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the GPA”).
3       By Summons Nos 2424, 2672 and 2820 of 2015 (collectively, “the Applications”), the defendants applied under O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) (“the ROC”) to strike out the statement of claim. The plaintiff was represented by Mr Irving Choh (“Mr Choh”) and Ms Melissa Kor. D1 and D2 were represented by Mr Ragbir Singh s/o Ram Singh Bajwa (“Mr Singh”) and Mr Laurence Goh Eng Yau (“Mr Goh”), respectively. Mr Jeyendran s/o Jeyapal (“Mr Jeyapal”) and Ms Debra Lam represented the AG.
4       On 3 March 2016, I heard and allowed the Applications, and delivered oral grounds. The plaintiff subsequently appealed, and these are the detailed grounds of my decision.
The facts
5       Mr Lee enlisted in the SAF on or about 8 November 2011. He was posted to the 3rd battalion of the Singapore Infantry Regiment in or around January 2012. Prior to his enlistment, Mr Lee had been diagnosed with asthma. To indicate his asthmatic condition, Mr Lee had to wear a blue band around his wrist while enlisted in the SAF.
6       On 17 April 2012, Mr Lee participated in the Exercise. The Exercise simulated an attack on four buildings in a residential area. At the material time, D1 was the Platoon Commander of the platoon which Mr Lee was attached to for the Exercise, and D2 was the Chief Safety Officer of the Exercise.
7       While participating in the Exercise, Mr Lee experienced difficulties breathing following the discharge of six smoke canisters by D1. The smoke canisters had been discharged by D1 for the purpose of providing cover for the simulated attack by Mr Lee’s platoon on the buildings. Subsequently, around the mid-point of the Exercise, Mr Lee collapsed and lost consciousness. He was first conveyed to the Sungei Gedong Medical Centre (“SGMC”) for medical attention. Thereafter, at or around 1.10pm, he was transported to the National University Hospital (“NUH”). He was pronounced dead on the same day at approximately 2.05pm.
8       Following Mr Lee’s passing, on 14 May and 14 November 2012, the Minister for Defence (“the Minister”), apprised Parliament on the Ministry of Defence’s investigation into the incident (see 
Singapore Parliamentary Debates
, 
Official Report
 (14 May 2012) vol 89 (Dr Ng Eng Hen, Minister for Defence) (“the May Debate”) and 
Singapore Parliamentary Debates
, 
Official Report
 (14 November 2012) vol 89 (Dr Ng Eng Hen, Minister for Defence) (“the November Debate”)). In particular, during the May Debate, the Minister informed Parliament that the Armed Forces Council had convened an independent Committee of Inquiry (“COI”) to thoroughly examine the circumstances surrounding Mr Lee’s death.
9       On 11 October 2012, the Minister for Finance (acting through the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Defence pursuant to the Delegation of Powers (Ministry of Finance) (Consolidation) Notification (Cap 1, N6, 2002 Rev Ed)) issued a certificate under s 14(1)(
b
) of the GPA (“the Certificate”). This certified that the death of Mr Lee would be treated as attributable to service for the purpose of an award under the Singapore Armed Forces (Pensions) Regulations (Cap 295, Rg 9, 2001 Rev Ed) (“the Pensions Regulations”). The plaintiff, while not disputing that the Certificate had been issued, raised issues as to the timing of its issuance. These allegations were not material to the Applications.
10     The COI concluded its investigations, and the Minister reported the findings of the COI to Parliament in the November Debate. I quote from the relevant portions of the November Debate:
[Mr Lee’s] cause of death was certified by the forensic pathologist of the Health Sciences Authority … to be due to an “acute allergic reaction to zinc chloride due to inhalation of zinc chloride fumes”. Zinc chloride is a primary component of smoke grenades currently used in the SAF.
The COI found that the number of smoke grenades used in the exercise exceeded the limit specified in training safety regulations. The Training Safety Regulations (TSR) stipulate that the minimum distance between each thrown smoke grenade should not be less than 20 metres and that the minimum distance between troops and the thrown smoke grenade should not be less than 10 metres. Based on the exercise layout, not more than two smoke grenades should have been used, but [D1] had thrown six grenades instead. The COI opined that “if the TSR had been complied with, [Mr Lee] and his platoon mates would not have been subjected to smoke that was as dense as that during the incident, and for as long as they were during the incident” and that “reduced exposure to smoke would have reduced the risks of any adverse reactions to the smoke.” The COI concluded that “the cause of death of [Mr Lee] resulted from inhalation of the fumes from the smoke grenades used in the incident”.
The COI is of the opinion that the actions of [D1], a Regular Captain, were negligent as he was aware of the specific TSR but did not comply with it.
…
To prevent a recurrence, the COI recommended measures to ensure compliance with TSRs through strengthening the role of the Safety Officer and educating commanders and troops on the [TSRs].
…
[The Ministry of Defence] has relieved the exercise Chief Safety Officer, [D2], and the Platoon Commander who threw the smoke grenades, [D1], of their duties. They have been re-deployed to assignments which do not oversee soldiers in training or operations. Following procedures and due process, the Chief Military Prosecutor will determine if these personnel should be subject to a General Court Martial …, to establish their degree of culpability and if found guilty to mete out the appropriate punishment. Police investigations are also ongoing to determine whether to prosecute the personnel involved in Civil Court.
…
It is pertinent that the COI only appeared to have found negligence on the part of D1 and not D2.
11     A coroner’s inquiry was conducted on 22 April, 10 July and 30 August 2013. On 30 August 2013, the State Coroner issued a Coroner’s Certificate, which stated as follows:
On 17th Apr 2012 at 1405 hours, at the [NUH], [Mr Lee] … died from Acute Allergic Reaction due to Inhalation of Zinc Chloride Fumes. Earlier that same day, he participated in a military training exercise. The exercise simulated an attack on 4 buildings in a residential area. During the attack, the platoon commander [D1] discharged smoke from smoke canisters. He said that he discharged one canister at Intervals of 10-second or thereabouts, totalling six. [Mr Lee] inhaled zinc chloride fumes and reacted adversely to the fumes, in what was then thought, to be an asthma attack. According to the pathologist, the history of asthma had predisposed [Mr Lee] to an allergic reaction although he could not be definitive whether the reaction here was due to inhalation of excessive fumes or mere inhalation of fumes. Both were possible. When [Mr Lee] became unconscious, CPR was initiated by [D2] and later, by a combat medic. He was rushed to the [SGMC] 10 minutes from the incident location. Upon arrival, he was already in a collapsed state and the [advanced cardiac life support] protocol was initiated. Shortly thereafter, he was rushed to the [NUH] where resuscitation efforts continued. But he succumbed to the acute episode of allergic reaction.
12     On 1 April 2015, the plaintiff commenced Suit 311/2015 against the defendants. In a pre-trial conference on 21 May 2015, the assistant registrar ordered that the filing of the defendants’ respective defences be stayed pending the outcome of the Applications.
Summary of the plaintiff’s pleadings
13     The plaintiff framed the causes of action against D1 and D2, and the AG on quite different footings. This is important.
14     The plaintiff sued D1 in the 
tort of negligence
. The plaintiff pleaded that D1 was negligent in:
(a)     failing to adhere to the SAF’s Training Safety Regulations (“the TSR”) when conducting the Exercise;
(b)     failing to take into consideration Mr Lee’s asthmatic condition (presumably with regard to the Exercise); and
(c)     detonating six smoke grenades instead of two in full knowledge that the detonation of the additional four grenades was excessive and not connected with the execution of his duties.
15     The plaintiff also sued D2 in the 
tort of negligence
. The plaintiff pleaded that D2 was in breach of his duty of care as the Chief Safety Officer of the Exercise in:
(a)     failing to adhere to the TSR when conducting the Exercise;
(b)     allowing D1 to detonate six grenades instead of two in full knowledge that detonation of the additional four grenades was excessive and not connected with the execution of his duties;
(c)     failing to ensure that there were medical officers present who were trained to recognise the severity of Mr Lee’s symptoms;
(d)     failing to ensure that the appropriate medical equipment was available on site in case of medical emergencies; and
(e)     failing to ensure that Mr Lee received prompt and adequate medical attention from a hospital instead of a military medical facility.
16     The plaintiff’s cause of action against the AG was for 
breach of contract
. The contract relied upon was an alleged contract of service which Mr Lee and the SAF entered into on or about 8 November 2011 when Mr Lee enlisted for national service. The plaintiff pleaded that the SAF had an obligation under the alleged contract to provide a safe and conducive environment for Mr Lee to train in, and that the SAF had breached this obligation as it failed to:
(a)     provide proper medical care and staff in place to deal with medical emergencies;
(b)     provide adequate protective gear for national servicemen undergoing exercises that involved the detonation of smoke grenades;
(c)     ensure that proper medical equipment was provided on site to deal with medical emergencies; and
(d)     provide a sufficient system of checks to ensure that regulations such as the TSR would be complied with.
17     By the foregoing, the plaintiff claimed against D1, D2 and the AG, jointly and severally, damages, the costs of Mr Lee’s tomb, amounting to $34,300, interests, costs, and such further or other relief as the court deemed fit. While ultimately it was not relevant to how I decided the Applications, it was unclear to me how the AG could be jointly and severally liable with D1 and D2 when the applicable causes of action were quite different. In fact, the claims were not framed on the basis that the three defendants were joint tortfeasors.
The applications and the issues arising therefrom
18     D1, D2 and the AG respectively applied to strike out the plaintiff’s claims. Both D1 and D2 sought to strike out the plaintiff’s negligence actions against them on the basis that s 14 of the GPA (“s 14”) (and in particular, s 14(1) of the GPA) absolved them of tortious liability. The AG, on the other hand, sought to strike out the plaintiff’s action against the SAF on the ground that, in law, no contract of service existed between Mr Lee and the SAF.
19     The legal principles applicable to applications for striking out under O 18 r 19 of the ROC are well-established. O 18 r 19 states:
 
Striking out pleadings and endorsements (O. 18, r. 19)
 
19.—(1) The Court may at any stage of the proceedings order to be struck out or amended any pleading or the endorsement of any writ in the action, or anything in any pleading or in the endorsement, on the ground that —
(
a
)    it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence, as the case may be;
(
b
)    it is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious;
(
c
)    it may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action; or
(
d
)    it is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court,
and may order the action to be stayed or dismissed or judgment to be entered accordingly, as the case may be.
(2)    No evidence shall be admissible on an application under paragraph (1)(
a
).
(3)    This Rule shall, as far as applicable, apply to an originating summons as if it were a pleading.
The defendants relied on O 18 r 19(1)(
a
), (
b
) and (
d
).
20     The test for whether a claim should be struck out under O 18 r 19(1)(
a
) depends on whether the statement of claim discloses some cause of action or raises a question fit to be decided at the trial (
Gabriel Peter & Partners (suing as a firm) v Wee Chong Jin and others
 
[1997] 3 SLR(R) 649
 (“
Gabriel Peter
”) at [21]). However, no evidence is admissible where the ground relied on for striking out is O 18 r 19(1)(
a
). A statement of claim might also be struck out under O 18 r 19(1)(
b
). Under this limb, the court considers whether the action being brought is “plainly or obviously unsustainable”: 
The “Bunga Melati 5”
 
[2012] 4 SLR 546
 at [32]–[33]. Such an action could be one that is either legally or factually unsustainable. In 
The “Bunga Melati 5”
, the Court of Appeal explained that an action could be said to be legally unsustainable if it is clear as a matter of law that even if a party were to succeed in proving all the facts which it offered or was required to prove, it would not be entitled to the relief sought. A factually unsustainable action is one where it is possible to say with confidence before the trial that the factual substratum of the claim is fanciful and entirely without substance (at [39]). Finally, a claim would be struck out as an abuse of the court’s process under O 18 r 19(1)(
d
) where the process of the court is being used 
mala fide
 or as a tool for vexation and oppression (see 
Singapore Civil Procedure 2016 (Vol I)
 (Foo Chee Hock, Gen Ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 2016) at para 18/19/14). Some examples of conduct constituting an abuse of the court’s process include the issuing of multiple or successive proceedings, issuing a writ for a collateral purpose, or commencing proceedings which involve a deception on the court.
21     It is also hornbook law that the court’s power to strike out pleadings should only be invoked in plain and obvious cases. The court would not engage in a minute and protracted examination of the documents and the facts of the case to determine if the plaintiff had a cause of action: 
Gabriel Peter
 at [18]. In the present case, save for the legal issues raised by the pleadings, the facts as the plaintiff pleaded were assumed to be true.
22     In the light of the above arguments and legal principles, the following issues arose for determination:
(a)     What is the effect of s 14(1) of the GPA (“s 14(1)”) on the plaintiff’s claim as against D1 and D2? It would be recalled that the plaintiff had pleaded that D1’s and D2’s breach of the TSR was a 
negligent
 (as opposed to 
intentional
) act. The issue before me was therefore this: even if it was assumed that D1 and D2 
had
 acted negligently, did s 14(1) preclude the plaintiff from suing either D1 or D2 in the tort of negligence? This raised a pure question of law that was fit to be decided in a striking out application.
(b)     It was not disputed that there is no 
written
 contract of service between Mr Lee and the SAF. The plaintiff’s case was that Mr Lee and the SAF had entered into a contract under the Enlistment Act (Cap 93, 2001 Rev Ed) (“the EA”). If Mr Lee did not have a contractual relationship with the SAF, the bedrock for the plaintiff’s claim for breach of contract would fall away. The issue before me was therefore this: did a contract of service exist between Mr Lee and the SAF? Again, this was an issue that was fit to be decided in a striking out application.
In the next section, I consider each issue in turn within the context of the plaintiff’s case against D1 and D2 on the one hand, and the plaintiff’s case against the AG on the other.
The decision
The plaintiff’s case against D1 and D2
23     At the outset, it should be remembered that the courts are mandated by s 9A of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1, 2002 Rev Ed) to prefer a statutory interpretation that would promote the purpose or object of the written law. As was stated by V K Rajah JA (sitting in the High Court) in 
Public Prosecutor v Low Kok Heng
 
[2007] 4 SLR(R) 183
 (at [57]):
… [Section] 9A of the Interpretation Act mandates that a purposive approach be adopted in the construction of all statutory provisions, and allows extrinsic material to be referred to, even where, on a plain reading, the words of a statute are clear and unambiguous. The purposive approach takes precedence over all other common law principles of interpretation. However, construction of a statutory provision pursuant to the purposive approach stipulated by s 9A is constrained by the parameters set by the literal text of the provision. The courts should confine themselves to interpreting statutory provisions purposively with the aid of extrinsic material within such boundaries and assiduously guard against inadvertently re-writing legislation. …
24     Hence, the analysis begins by considering the history, language, purpose and scope of s 14, before consideration is given to how the legal principles apply to the facts of this case.
The history and purpose of s 14
25     Section 14 of the GPA provides as follows:
 
Provisions relating to the armed forces
 
14.—(1) Nothing done or omitted to be done by a member of the forces while on duty as such shall subject either him or the Government to liability in tort for causing the death of another person, or for causing personal injury to another person, in so far as the death or personal injury is due to anything suffered by that other person while he is a member of the forces if —
(
a
)    at the time when the thing is suffered by that other person, he is —
(i)    on duty as a member of the forces; or
(ii)   though not on duty as a member of the forces —
(A)    on any land, premises, ship, aircraft or vehicle for the time being used for the purposes of the forces; or
(B)    on any journey necessary to enable him to report for duty as such or to return home after such duty; and
(
b
)    the Minister responsible for finance certifies that his suffering that thing has been or will be treated as attributable to service for the purposes of entitlement to an award under any written law relating to the disablement or death of members of the force of which he is a member:
Provided that this subsection shall not exempt a member of the forces from liability in tort in any case in which the court is satisfied that the act or omission was not connected with the execution of his duties as a member of the forces.
(2)    No proceedings in tort shall lie against the Government for death or personal injury due to anything suffered by a member of the forces if —
(
a
)    that thing is suffered by him in consequence of the nature or condition of any such land, premises, ship, aircraft or vehicle as aforesaid, or in consequence of the nature or condition of any equipment or supplies used for the purposes of the forces; and
(
b
)    the Minister responsible for finance certifies as mentioned in subsection (1),
nor shall any act or omission of an officer of the Government subject him to liability in tort for death or personal injury, in so far as the death or personal injury is due to anything suffered by a member of the forces being a thing as to which the conditions aforesaid are satisfied.
(3)    The Minister charged with the responsibility for defence or internal security, as the case may be, if satisfied that it is the fact —
(
a
)    that a person was or was not on any particular occasion on duty as a member of the forces;
(
aa
)   that a person was or was not on any particular occasion either on any journey necessary to enable him to report for duty as such or to return home after such duty; or
(
b
)    that at any particular time any land, premises, ship, aircraft, vehicle, equipment or supplies was or was not, or were or were not, used for the purposes of the forces,
may issue a certificate certifying that to be the fact; and any such certificate shall, for the purposes of this section, be conclusive as to the fact which it certifies.
(4)    No act or omission of a public officer shall subject him to liability in tort for death or personal injury, in so far as the death or personal injury is due to anything suffered by a member of the forces being a thing as to which the conditions mentioned in subsection (1) or (2) are satisfied.
(5)    In this section —
“armed forces” means the Singapore Armed Forces raised and maintained under the Singapore Armed Forces Act [Cap. 295];
“forces” includes the armed forces and the police force; and
“police force” means the Singapore Police Force established under the Police Force Act [Cap. 235] and includes any volunteer, auxiliary or special police force attached to, or coming under the jurisdiction of, the Police Force.
At the outset, it may be noted that the main sub-section that is directly relevant to the Applications is s 14(1).
26     I begin by recounting the history of s 14. By virtue of the Malaysian Modification of Laws (Government Proceedings and Public Authorities Protection) (Extension and Modification) Order 1965 which came into operation on 25 February 1965 (“the Modification of Laws Order”), the Crown Suits Ordinance (Cap 12) was repealed and the provisions found in the Malaysian Government Proceedings Ordinance 1956 (No 58 of 1956) (“the 1956 Ordinance”) were extended to Singapore, with minor modifications. Thus, ss 14(1)–(3) of the GPA were originally brought into and made part of Singapore law by the 1956 Ordinance and the Modification of Laws Order.
27     When Singapore separated from Malaysia and became an independent nation state on 9 August 1965, the provisions of the 1956 Ordinance remained the law in Singapore by virtue of s 13 of the Republic of Singapore Independence Act 1965 (Act 9 of 1965). By the Government Proceedings (Amendment) Act 1966 (Act 20 of 1966), the provisions of the 1956 Ordinance were formally amended (“the 1966 Amendment”). This was necessary as a consequence of Singapore ceasing to be a part of Malaysia (see 
Singapore Parliamentary Debates
, 
Official Report
 (22 June 1966) (E W Barker, Minister for Law and National Development) vol 25 at cols 135–136). Sub-section (4) of s 14, which deals with acts or omissions of 
public officers
, was also introduced via the 1966 Amendment.
28     Given that the parentage of ss 14(1)–(3) is the 1956 Ordinance, in order to glean the purpose and rationale of the relevant sub-sections, it is important to first understand the origins of the 1956 Ordinance.
29     In this regard, s 14 of the 1956 Ordinance, which is substantially similar to ss 14(1)–(3) of the GPA (though note my comments at [40] below), 
was derived from s 10 of the English Crown Proceedings Act 1947
 (c 44) (UK) (“the 1947 UK Act”). I quote from the Attorney General’s speech in the Legislative Council of the Federation of Malaya at the second reading of the Government Proceedings Bill 1956 where the position is clearly stated (Federation of Malaya, 
Legislative Council Debates
, 
Official Report
 (8 November 1956) at cols 1746–1751):
The law embodied in this Bill follows very closely the existing law contained in the Government Suits Enactment of the Federated Malay States and in certain other Un-federated States. It also contains a number of provisions which have been taken from the Crown Proceedings Act of 1947 of England. … [A] 
further provision is made in Clause 14 which is taken from the English legislation to deal with the Armed Forces. The effect of that Clause is to make neither the Government nor fellow-members of its Forces liable for acts of negligence and so forth committed whilst in the course of service against a fellow member of the Forces also on duty.
 … [I]t has always been assumed, that 
on grounds of public policy at any rate, such actions would in many cases be strongly discouraged by the Courts
. It would be most unfortunate, for example, if after every battle a member of the force sued his Company Commander for what he considered gross negligence in the handling of his Company. …
[emphasis added]
30     Given that the origins of s 14 of the 1956 Ordinance is the English legislation (
viz
, the 1947 UK Act), it would be salient to consider the purpose behind the enactment of the equivalent provision in the 1947 UK Act. As the 1947 UK Act was designed to change the common law position, a brief background of the position under the common law prior to the enactment of the 1947 UK Act is apposite.
31     Prior to the enactment of the 1947 UK Act, the English Crown could not be sued. This common law position of Crown immunity against legal suits stemmed from the maxim that “the Crown could do no wrong”. An exception to this rule was contract claims, for which a special “petition of right” had to be filed and endorsed by the English courts. The position was considered quite unsatisfactory. The 1947 UK Act was thus enacted by the English Parliament, opening the door to the citizenry to sue the Crown in both tort and contract without requiring the application of special rules of procedure (see also the recent Court of Appeal decision in 
AHQ v Attorney-General and another appeal
 
[2015] 4 SLR 760
 at [11]–[12]).
32     However, the removal of the Crown’s immunity against suit was not intended to be and was not absolute. One area that received particular attention was the armed forces. The English Parliament took the view that Crown immunity should be retained when it came to the armed forces. This was achieved by s 10 of the 1947 UK Act, which states as follows:
10.–(1) Nothing done or omitted to be done by a member of the armed forces of the Crown while on duty as such shall subject either him or the Crown to liability in tort for causing the death of another person, or for causing personal injury to another person, in so far as the death or personal injury is due to anything suffered by that other person while he is a member of the armed forces of the Crown if —
(
a
)    at the time when that thing is suffered by that other person, he is either on duty as a member of the armed forces of the Crown or is, though not on duty as such, on any land, premises, ship, aircraft or vehicle for the time being used for the purposes of the armed forces of the Crown; and
(
b
)    the Minister of Pensions certifies that his suffering that thing has been or will be treated as attributable to service for the purposes of entitlement to an award under the Royal Warrant, Order in Council or Order of His Majesty relating to the disablement or death of members of the force of which he is a member:
Provided that this subsection shall not exempt a member of the said forces from liability in tort in any case in which the court is satisfied that the act or omission was not connected with the execution of his duties as a member of those forces.
(2)    No proceedings in tort shall lie against the Crown for death or personal injury due to anything suffered by a member of the armed forces of the Crown if —

It would be noted straightaway that there are striking similarities in the language of the 1947 UK Act and ss 14(1)–(3) of the GPA.
33     The purpose and rationale for the enactment of s 10 of the 1947 UK Act was explained by the then Attorney-General of the United Kingdom, Sir Hartley Shawcross, in the second reading of the Crown Proceedings Bill (“the UK Crown Proceedings Bill”) in the House of Commons, in the following terms (see United Kingdom, House of Commons, 
Parliamentary Debates
 (4 July 1947) vol 439 at cols 1675–1753):
… Although the general effect of the Bill is to place the Crown in exactly the same position as the subject, there are, obviously, as the House will appreciate, a number of matters in which an analogy cannot be drawn between the Crown and a private citizen. 
The private citizen does not have the same kind of responsibility for protecting the public, such as the Crown possesses
; he does not have the care of the public safety; he does not have the defence of the realm to consider; he is not responsible for the organisation of such great services as the Post Office. In these matters—and there are others which will occur to hon. Members—the functions of the Crown, under our constitution, 
involve duties and responsibilities which no subject is required to undertake, and these distinctions are inevitably, necessarily and properly reflected by various provisions of this Bill
. But, subject to necessary and inevitable distinctions of that kind the broad purpose and effect of this Bill is to enable the citizen to take exactly the same kind of proceedings against the Crown, and in the same circumstances, as if the Crown were a fellow citizen.
…
 
Clause 10 is another Clause to which the attention of the House ought to be directed, because it contains a special exemption, or exclusion, in the case of claims between members of the Armed Forces in respect of personal injury which they have sustained while on duty as members of the Forces, or on Service premises. Here, again, I think Members will appreciate the special position, which exists.
 For instance, it is necessary 
in the course of Service training
, 
in order to secure the efficiency of the Forces
, to exercise them in the use of live ammunition, in flying in close formation and, in the Navy, in battle conditions, with, perhaps, destroyers dashing about with lights out, and so on. 
These operations are highly dangerous
 and, if done by private citizens, would, no doubt, be extremely blameworthy, 
but it is impossible to apply the ordinary law of tort in regard to them, or make the Crown liable for any injury which, unhappily, results
.
It is right that I should point out that under the existing law one member of the Forces might, in theory, at all events, in circumstances like that, bring an action against another. … 
But now that legal liability on the part of the Crown is being created we have felt it essential … to provide that neither the Crown, nor its servants or officers, shall be liable for accidents which occur while both parties are on Service duty, or on Service premises.
…
… Although, at first sight, it is a withdrawal of the right of action which does theoretically exist at the moment it is one which is very infrequently exercised, to say the least. Hon. Members will appreciate … that 
it would be impossible to risk prejudicing the efficiency and discipline of the Forces by doing less than we propose to do, or that any officer or soldier ought to be placed in the position of feeling that if he makes a mistake, and personal injury results to another soldier, or man under his command, he may be liable to pay damages and the Crown will not be obliged to stand behind him
.
… I ought to add that while the solider who receives an injury on duty will not be able to recover damages in the courts, that does not mean that he will go unrecompensed. If he is injured, and remains in the Service, he will get proper medical treatment, and care; if he is invalidated out, or dies, he, or his dependents, will have pension rights. As to that, the capital value of the pension rights, in terms of money is, in general … as valuable as the probable damages which may be recoverable in an action at law if such an action lay.
…
The effect of [Clause 10(1)] is certainly to bar a soldier who, while on duty, was injured by the tortious act of another soldier, also on duty at the time [from claiming against the tortfeasor]. The effect of the proviso is that if a soldier, although doing what he did in the course of his period of duty, was doing something which was quite outside the scope of his duty, an action will not be barred. If, for instance, a soldier, because of a personal dislike for the sergeant-major, or some other member of the sergeant’s mess, strikes him in the face, and causes him injury, that would not be a case where Clause 10(1) would operate to exclude an action. …
[emphasis added]
34     It is clear from the foregoing that the English Parliament and Malayan Legislative Council had similar reasons for enacting s 10 of the 1947 UK Act and s 14 of the 1956 Ordinance, respectively. I summarise the rationales from the parliamentary speeches cited above:
(a)     While the general effect of the 1947 UK Act and the 1956 Ordinance was to place the Crown or the Government in the same position as a citizen, a distinction had to be drawn when it came to matters concerning the defence of the country. In such matters, the Crown’s or the Government’s special position and responsibility had to be recognised and safeguarded through legislation.
(b)     There was a need to ensure that the armed forces and its members would be able to train in a disciplined and efficient manner, and conduct their operations effectively so as to ensure that their paramount purpose of safeguarding the defence of the country was not compromised. The operations of the armed forces, whether in war or during training, carried with it a high element of risk. Public policy dictated that it was necessary to ensure that no right of action in tort lay against the Crown or the Government for any injury or death that resulted from such operations. The immunity ought not to be limited to the Crown or the Government – it was equally a matter of public policy that members of the armed forces ought not to feel threatened or burdened by the prospect of legal action for acts of negligence committed in the course of and for the purpose of discharging their duties.
(c)     Although the relevant provision removed the injured member’s right of action in tort against the member who had occasioned the injury while discharging his duty, this did not mean that there would be no recompense for the injured member. A statutory mechanism ensured that compensation would be given to the injured member or, in the event of death, the member’s estate.
35     It should be mentioned that the immunity only extended to tortious acts committed 
in connection with the execution of the member’s duties
 as a member of the armed forces. This followed from the rationale stated at [34(b)] above. If the member of the armed forces did something outside of the scope of his duty, for example, striking another member out of animosity or spite (as per the example given by Sir Shawcross at [33] above), an action in tort by the injured member against the tortfeasor would not be barred. This was reflected in the proviso to s 10(1) of the 1947 UK Act and s 14(1) of the 1956 Ordinance, which may also be found in s 14(1). It would follow that so long as the acts of negligence were committed by the member of the armed forces in the course of and for the purpose of discharging his duties (
ie
, in connection with the execution of his duties), he would fall within the scope of s 14(1), and would be immune to liability in tort.
36     As the wellspring of s 14 is s 10 of the 1947 UK Act and s 14 of the 1956 Ordinance, there is sound reason to proceed on the footing that the 
raison d'être
 for all three enactments is the same. Accordingly, I am of the view that the purpose or object of s 14 would encompass the rationales mentioned above.
37     Section 14 was debated in Parliament in 1986. In that debate, the Member of Parliament for Anson, Mr JB Jeyaretnam, posed a question concerning s 14. Specifically, Mr Jeyaretnam queried why the families of personnel employed in the armed forces were discriminated against when other ordinary citizens could recover the full amount of damages and compensation in respect of injuries or death occurring outside the SAF. The reply of the then Minister of State for Defence, BG Lee Hsien Loong, is noteworthy and crystallises the thinking that underpins s 14 (see 
Singapore Parliamentary Debates
, 
Official Report
 (19 March 1986) (BG Lee Hsien Loong, Minister of State for Defence) vol 47 at cols 741–742):
As for the Government Proceedings Act and why the Government cannot be sued, we do not follow British precedent blindly. We follow it when there are good reasons to do so. Why can you not sue the State in case a serviceman dies in training or in action? The reason as given by the British is that in this case, 
the State is fundamentally different from a private citizen, and therefore cannot be treated on the same standing
. I will quote here from a submission in the House of Lords in 1947, when the Crown Proceedings Bill was introduced in Britain and it applies to us. 
“'The private citizen does not have the same kind of responsibility as the Crown for protecting the public. He does not have the care of public safety. He does not have the defence of the Realm to consider. In these matters, the functions of the Crown involve duties and responsibilities which no subject is required to undertake and these distinctions are inevitably, necessarily and properly reflected by various provisions in the Bill.” In other words, that is the reason why you cannot sue the Government under such cases. And 
to be able to sue the Government under such cases would be destructive to the morale, discipline and efficiency of the service
. We concur with these views and we have adopted the same practice. 
...
An alternative could be to sue an individual instead of the Crown under such circumstances, namely, the officer involved who gave the order. However, this is also not allowed, for a specific reason, namely, that if we propose to do so, 
any officer or soldier who is making an operational decision
, is placed in a difficult position. And in training you make decisions which are just the same as operational ones. 
You have to have the absolute confidence that you can make the judgment correctly.
 You cannot afford always to have at the back of your mind the thought that, “If I do wrong, will I be sued? Will the Government not back me? Should I have to appear in court?” That is the reason why the law stands as it is.
…
[emphasis added]
The above extract from the parliamentary debates mirrors the rationales referred to at [34] above. Thus, it may be seen that the consistent legislative intention underpinning s 14 is to ensure that the Government and the members of the armed forces are shielded from liability in tort in order to ensure that the efficiency and discipline of the armed forces in both training and operations are safeguarded. It is a recognition of the special position of the armed forces and its members.
38     I should point out that Singapore does not stand alone in enacting legislation similar to s 10 of the 1947 UK Act. In this regard, it should be noted that s 14 of the 1956 Ordinance remains in force in Malaysia under s 14 of the Malaysian Government Proceedings Act 1956 (Act 359). Similar provisions excluding liability in tort for the armed forces and its personnel can be found in jurisdictions across the Commonwealth too, and this includes:
(a)     Hong Kong (see s 8 of Hong Kong’s Crown Proceedings Ordinance 1957 (Cap 300));
(b)     Fiji (see s 7 of Fiji’s Crown Proceedings Act (Cap 24));
(c)     Jamaica (see s 8 of Jamaica’s Crown Proceedings Act 1959); and
(d)     Canada (see s 8 of Canada’s Crown Liability and Proceedings Act (RSC, 1985, c 50), though it should be noted that s 8 of the Act does not appear to be limited only to 
tortious
 liability and appears to cover only the liability of the Crown itself and not individual personnel).
39     For completeness, I note that s 10 of the 1947 UK Act has been replaced by the provisions in the Crown Proceedings (Armed Forces) Act 1987 (c 25) (UK) (“the 1987 UK Act”). This Act repealed s 10 of the 1947 UK Act and provided for the revival of s 10 of the 1947 UK Act by the Secretary of State only where “it appears to him necessary and expedient” to do so, such as by reason of (a) an imminent national danger or great emergency that has arisen, or (b) for the purposes of any warlike operations in any part of the world outside the United Kingdom or of any other operations which are or are to be carried out in connection with the warlike activity of any persons in any such part of the world (see s 2(2) of the 1987 UK Act). This is not the position in Singapore. Section 14 defined the scope and content of the inquiry before me.
40     Finally, it should be noted that in 1996, sub-s (1)(
a
)(ii)(B) (and other consequential sub-sections) was inserted into s 14 in response to the decision of the High Court in 
Abdul Rahman v Attorney-General
 
[1985–1986] SLR(R) 705
 where F A Chua J decided that a member of the armed forces who was negligently injured by a lorry driven by an employee of the Government while on his way home from camp was 
not
 barred by s 14 of the Government Proceedings Act (Cap 21, 1970 Rev Ed) from suing the Government in tort (see 
Singapore Parliamentary Debates
, 
Official Report
 (11 December 1996) (RAdm Teo Chee Hean, Second Minister for Defence) vol 66 at cols 972–974). Section 14(1)(
a
)(ii)(B) of the GPA (and other consequential sub-sections) was therefore enacted to cater for a situation where a member of the armed forces was injured outside the confines of a military installation while he was on the way to or from duty. Section 14(1)(
a
)(ii)(B) of the GPA is not relevant to the present case save to the extent that its introduction demonstrates the importance that Parliament has placed on giving adequate immunity from liability in tort to the Government and members of the armed forces while performing their duties whether such duties are performed inside or outside a military installation.
The application of s 14 to the facts of this case
41     Under s 14(1), the Government or the member of the SAF will not be subject to liability in tort for causing death or personal injury to another member of the SAF (“the injured member”) if:
(a)     at the time of the injury, the injured member was on duty (“condition 1”); and
(b)     the Minister responsible for finance certifies that the injured member’s injury has been or will be treated as attributable to service for the purposes of entitlement to an award under any written law relating to the disablement or death of members of the SAF (“condition 2”).
42     Importantly, there is a proviso to s 14(1) (“the Proviso”), the effect of which is that if the Proviso applies, the member of the SAF will be subject to liability in tort notwithstanding the satisfaction of condition 1 and condition 2. I had touched on this earlier. The Proviso states that the member of the SAF will not be exempted from liability in tort in a case where the court is satisfied that the act or omission of that member was 
not connected with the execution of his duties as a member of the SAF
. The term “member of the forces” in s 14(1) is broad and would include, for example, a full-time national serviceman and a regular serviceman as defined under the EA.
43     It was common ground that:
(a)     D1 and D2 were members of the SAF at the time of the incident that formed the basis of the claim;
(b)     the Exercise, which was the setting of the incident, was an authorised military exercise;
(c)     D1 and D2 were carrying out the Exercise in discharge of their duties as members of the SAF;
(d)     D1 and D2 committed the alleged acts of negligence for the purpose of the Exercise; and
(e)     Mr Lee participated in the Exercise in the discharge of his duties as a full-time national serviceman.
44     Based on the foregoing, condition 1 (that Mr Lee was on duty as a member of the SAF at the time of the incident) was satisfied. As stated at [9] above, it was not disputed by the plaintiff that the relevant certificate under s 14(1)(
b
) of the GPA was issued (
ie
, the Certificate). Condition 2 was thus satisfied as well.
45     The foundation of the plaintiff’s complaint was that by breaching relevant safety regulations and protocols, D1 and D2 acted negligently in exceeding or falling short of their duties thereby causing or contributing to the death of Mr Lee. Thus, the sole issue to be considered in the Applications as regards D1 and D2 was whether the Proviso applied to disentitle D1 and D2 to the exemption under s 14(1) from tortious liability to the plaintiff.
46     For the Proviso to apply, the plaintiff had to show that the acts or omissions of D1 and D2 were 
not connected with
 the execution of D1’s and D2’s duties as members of the SAF. Mr Choh submitted that the detonation of smoke grenades in excess of the numbers prescribed in the TSR was an act that was 
extraneous
 to the scope of their respective duties simply by reason of the fact that it constituted a breach of the TSR. Specifically, his submission was that: (a) D1 had breached the TSR and thereby acted outside the scope of his duties by detonating six smoke grenades (where the TSR only provided for the detonation of two smoke grenades); and, (b) D2 had acted outside the scope of his duties by 
allowing
 D1 to breach the TSR and detonate six smoke grenades. It was argued that, as a result, D1 and D2 fell outside of the immunity afforded by s 14(1). In this regard, Mr Choh was not asserting that the alleged breach of the TSR on the part of D1 and D2 was 
intentional
. Neither was he asserting that the conduct in question did not take place while D1 and D2 were attempting to execute their duties as members of the SAF. In other words, Mr Choh’s submission was that the alleged fact that a breach of the TSR had occurred in the conduct of the Exercise must 
ipso facto
 lead to the conclusion that the acts and omissions of D1 and D2 were extraneous to or not in connection with the execution of their duties as members of the SAF. This was so even if the said acts and omissions occurred in the course of and in an attempt to genuinely execute the Exercise. Put simply, his submission was effectively that the Proviso applied once the TSR was breached regardless of whether the breach was a result of acts of negligence committed by D1 and D2 in the course of and for the purpose of discharging their duties. I was unable to agree with Mr Choh.
47     I was of the view that the Proviso was not intended to be construed in such a narrow manner such that any breach of a safety regulation (or, for that matter, any regulation) would 
in and of itself
 lead to the conclusion that the act or omission was not connected with the execution of the serviceman’s duty as a member of the forces. Mr Choh was effectively making the following 
a priori
 argument: once the act of negligence was the failure to follow rules or regulations, that act would fall within the Proviso and the immunity under s 14(1) would therefore not apply. This surely could not be correct. It seemed to me fairly self-evident that most (if not all) acts of negligence would involve some form of non-compliance with safety regulations and procedures, and it is difficult to imagine that Parliament had intended to so limit the reach of s 14(1).
48     In my view, to construe s 14(1) as applying only to situations where injury or death had resulted despite safety guidelines and protocols being observed would be to unduly limit the scope of s 14(1) on a number of levels. First, Mr Choh’s interpretation did not flow from a plain reading of s 14(1). Second, if Mr Choh’s interpretation of s 14(1) was adopted, there would be little room for s 14(1) to operate and the purpose of the immunity under s 14(1) would be effectively neutered. This is because where safety guidelines and procedures are assiduously followed but injury nonetheless results, it would be very unlikely that it could be said that the injury resulted from an act of negligence. After all, safety guidelines and procedures are designed to prevent the occurrence of such incidents. I therefore had difficulty seeing how a member of the SAF who had followed safety regulations and procedures could be regarded as negligent if an injury nonetheless ensued. Such a member would, in all likelihood, not require the immunity afforded by s 14(1) simply because there would be no tortious liability to begin with. This being the case, the question was whether there was any conceivable reason why a member of the SAF who had negligently failed to comply with safety regulations and procedures ought not to be covered by the immunity under s 14(1). I was not able to see any. The section is targeted at offering protection to members of the SAF against liability for, 
inter alia
, negligent conduct where the negligent conduct is 
connected with the execution of the member’s duties
. If the member was negligent in the execution of his duties, did it matter that the act of negligence involved a breach of safety regulations and procedures? In my view, it did not. The section was not concerned with 
how
 the negligence occurred. What mattered was whether the negligent conduct occurred in connection with the execution of the member’s duties.
49     It should be noted that if Mr Choh’s argument were to succeed, this would effectively mean that the SAF would not be obliged to stand behind D1 and D2 because the finding would be that D1 and D2 had acted in a manner extraneous to the scope of their duties as members of the SAF. The SAF would thus 
not
 be responsible for the consequences of such actions. This is a point that the plaintiff recognised, as the plaintiff did not sue the AG in tort. The result would be D1 and D2 being left high and dry even though it was not disputed that their acts were solely for the purpose of the Exercise. To my mind, this could not be right, and illustrated the difficulties with Mr Choh’s argument.
50     That s 14(1) immunises a member of the SAF and the SAF from liability in negligence where the negligence is committed by the member 
in the course of executing his duties
 is crystal clear from the language of the Proviso. The Proviso states that the immunity would not extend to a situation where “the act or omission 
was not connected with the execution of his duties
 as a member of those forces” [emphasis added]. In my judgment, the relevant (and indeed the sole) question was 
not
 whether D1 and D2 had complied with the TSR or 
how
 they had committed the allegedly negligent acts, but whether they had committed the allegedly negligent acts 
in connection with the execution of their duties as members of the SAF
. The language of the Proviso was deliberately and carefully chosen. The Proviso states that the act or omission on the part of the allegedly negligent member of the SAF had to be 
not
 connected with the execution of his duties for that member to fall outside the scope of immunity conferred by s 14(1). The emphasis is on the nexus between the act or omission and the member’s execution of his duties. In other words, the act or omission must have had 
no connection
 to the discharge of the member’s duties for the Proviso to apply. A negligent discharge of duty would by any account be an act or omission that was connected with the execution of duty. Framing the point another way, negligently acting in excess of the TSR (assuming that this was indeed true) did 
not
 mean that D1 and D2 did not act in a manner unconnected with their duties as members of the SAF.
51     I was fortified in my view by the legislative purpose of s 14. As stated, one purpose of s 14 is to safeguard the efficiency of the armed forces’ training. Another object of s 14 is to ensure that members of the SAF would not be burdened by the prospect of legal action when training to the point of having to constantly look over their shoulders. The two rationales go hand-in-hand. If members of the SAF are constantly worried about facing an action in negligence and thereby second-guessing the consequences of every action, the SAF would not be able to train effectively or act decisively when conducting operations. This is the reason why s 14(1) adopts broad language and immunises members of the SAF from liability in tort when the relevant act or omission is 
connected
 with the execution of the member’s duties.
52     In this regard, it is also useful to refer to the comments made by the Lord Chancellor, Viscount Jowitt, on the occasion of the second reading of the UK Crown Proceedings Bill in the House of Lords (see United Kingdom, House of Lords, 
Parliamentary Debates
 (4 March 1947) vol 146 at cols 60–93):
To give a simple illustration, let me take the Charge of the Light Brigade. Could a trooper who took part in that Charge, whose leg was shattered by a cannon-ball, have brought an action against Lord Raglan (I think it was), to recover damages on the ground that Lord Raglan had blundered? When the “Victoria” and the “Camperdown” came into collision, could a sailor who went down in the “Victoria” have brought an action against the Admiral for giving an order which, as he would say, brought about the damage? Have you to empanel a jury in the King’s Bench Division to determine whether there was or was not a case of negligence? And consider the case of Passchendaele. Could a soldier who was injured through sticking in the mud at Passchendaele have brought an action against Sir Douglas Haig alleging that he had not properly considered the nature of the terrain or the effect of the bombardment on the drainage system? And would Sir Douglas Haig have been able to answer: “Well, I quite realize all those things, but I had to do this because the French were being hard pressed at the time”? Have a jury to be empanelled to try all those questions which are obviously quite unfitted for them? Therefore we make it quite plain here that there must be no action in respect of these matters, either against the Crown or against a servant of the Crown, behind whom of course the Crown would have to stand if an action were allowed in respect of these matters.
53     The examples given by Viscount Jowitt are of various incidents that occurred between the 1800s and the 1900s which involved the United Kingdom’s armed forces. These are famous examples where mass casualties resulted from the alleged negligence or tortious acts of the commanding officers. Clearly, the English Parliament had contemplated that s 10 of the 1947 UK Act would apply broadly such that an action in tort would not lie against the Crown or the member of the armed forces even in such circumstances.
54     The examples given by Viscount Jowitt above may be contrasted with the example given by Sir Shawcross in his speech quoted above at [33]. Therein, Sir Shawcross made the point that the immunity conferred by s 10 of the 1947 UK Act would not cover a member of the armed forces who, out of 
personal
 dislike for another member, struck that member in the face. This contrast highlights the essential scope of s 10 of the 1947 UK Act. Clearly, the act of injuring another out of 
personal dislike
 would not by any stretch of the imagination be an act that was connected with the execution of the member’s duties. It could not be said to be an act authorised by the armed forces or incidental to the serviceman’s duties as a member of the armed forces. In fact, Sir Shawcross described it as “quite outside the scope of [the member’s] duty”. It is also significant that such an act would not be a 
negligent
 act, but an 
intentional
 one. Evidently, it was envisaged that the immunity conferred under s 10 of the 1947 UK Act would not extend to an intentional tortious act wholly separate and independent of the member’s duties as a member of the armed forces. This, in my view, is equally the position under s 14(1).
55     It should also be reiterated that the plaintiff had 
not
 suggested that D1’s or D2’s breach of the safety regulations was an act done 
intentionally
. Rather, the plaintiff’s allegation was that the breach of the TSR was a negligent act on the part of both D1 and D2. In my judgment, the allegedly negligent conduct on D1’s and D2’s part 
was intrinsically connected to and a result of
 the execution of their duties in the conduct of the Exercise as members of the SAF. Such conduct occurred when they were functioning as the Platoon Commander and the Chief Safety Officer. It was not possible to divorce the relevant acts and omissions of D1 and D2 from the Exercise. There was nothing in the pleadings or the various affidavits filed that indicated that D1’s and D2’s conduct was not precipitated by the Exercise. Instead, the throwing of the smoke grenades by D1 was an 
integral
 part of the Exercise and his duties.
56     In fact, the plaintiff’s allegation was that D1 and D2 had 
carried out the Exercise
 negligently. The plaintiff’s pleadings stated that D1 and D2 had failed to “adhere to the TSR 
when conducting the military exercise
” [emphasis added].
[note: 1]
 This was a recognition on the plaintiff’s part that the allegedly negligent act of failing to act in accordance with the TSR was an act that was done 
in the course of conducting the Exercise
. Significantly, Mr Choh also stated during the hearing of the Applications that he did not disagree that D1 and D2 were carrying out “an authorised military exercise” and that the plaintiff’s complaint was “as regards the way it was carried out”.
[note: 2]
 Specifically, the plaintiff would have no basis to sue D2 if his conduct was not a result of acting in connection with the Exercise because the plaintiff’s action against D2 was premised 
solely
 on the fact that D2 was, at the time of the incident, the Chief Safety Officer of the Exercise. Acting as the Chief Safety Officer of the Exercise was undoubtedly part of D2’s duty as a member of the SAF. On the basis of the plaintiff’s pleadings and Mr Choh’s submissions, it was difficult to see how it could be said that the relevant acts and/or omissions on the part of D1 and D2 were 
unconnected
 with their duties as members of the SAF in the conduct of the Exercise.
57     If Mr Choh’s argument was that an act of negligence 
per se
 would attract the application of the Proviso, this was also an argument that could not succeed. As explained above, the purpose or object of s 14(1) is to grant the Government and members of the SAF immunity from liability in tort. This encompasses the tort of negligence. To accept the argument that acts of negligence 
per se
 engaged the Proviso would be counterintuitive to the purpose of s 14(1), and indeed, would circumvent the grant of immunity in the first place. It was hard to imagine that was Parliament’s intention.
58     Ultimately, the immunity granted under s 14(1) extended to acts or omissions committed in the course of the execution of the member’s duties. The relevant question of whether the act or omission was connected with the course of the member executing his duties is a question of fact. As I have explained, the undisputed facts indicated that D1 and D2 were at all material times acting in the course of their duties as Platoon Commander and Chief Safety Officer. The question is 
not
 whether the said act or omission was connected with the member of the SAF executing his duties 
in accordance with prescribed rules and regulations
. Mr Choh sought to read those words into the Proviso. I was not convinced that there was a principled basis to do so. In fact, to so expand the width of the Proviso (and concomitantly, to restrict or perhaps neuter the immunity conferred by s 14(1)) would, given the purpose and rationale behind s 14(1), amount to impermissible judicial legislation. In the final analysis, the allegation against D1 and D2 was that they had discharged their duties negligently; the relevant acts and omissions were therefore clearly connected with D1’s and D2’s execution of their duties as members of the SAF.
59     In the circumstances, I concluded that, even assuming the veracity of the plaintiff’s pleadings, the acts and/or omissions of D1 and D2 did not fall outside the scope of s 14(1), and the statutory immunity thereunder applied to bar the plaintiff’s right of action in negligence against D1 and D2. The portions of the plaintiff’s statement of claim that concerned the plaintiff’s claim against D1 and D2 were therefore struck out.
The plaintiff’s case against the AG
60     The plaintiff’s case against the AG was based on the breach of a contract of service under the EA between Mr Lee and the SAF. The question of whether a contract of service existed between Mr Lee and the SAF is a question of law that could be answered based on the facts as pleaded by the plaintiff.
61     The alleged contractual relationship was, in the course of submissions and arguments, characterised by Mr Choh in a variety of ways. It was first referred to as a “mandatory contract”, and then later as a “quasi-contract” or a “unilateral contract”. He also argued that the relationship between Mr Lee and the SAF could be viewed as a contractual relationship in a “
sui generis
 sense”. The state of flux that Mr Choh exhibited in his attempts to put a label on the alleged contract previewed the inherent flaw in the cause of action against the AG.
62     Mr Choh relied on the cases of 
Sakinas Sdn Bhd v Siew Yik Hau and another
 
[2002] 5 MLJ 498
 (“
Sakinas
”) and 
Yap Yew Cheong and another v Dirga Niaga (Selangor) Sdn Bhd
 
[2005] 7 MLJ 660
 (“
Yap Yew Cheong
”) to contend that mandatory contracts under statutory legislation did exist, and were not an illusory or wholly unsustainable legal concept. He also cited the example of compulsory third party motor insurance as a type of mandatory contract. In his submission, the contract between the SAF and Mr Lee was a form of mandatory contract where one or both parties had been mandated (by statute or otherwise) to enter into a contract with a fixed form and express and/or implied terms. In this regard, he argued that even if the creation of the relationship between the SAF and Mr Lee stemmed from statute, it did not necessarily mean that it could not be characterised within a contractual framework or that a contractual relationship could not exist. Ultimately, I took the view that the examples offered Mr Choh no foothold for him to make his submission.
63     The discussion of the plaintiff’s case against the AG will proceed as follows. First, I consider the relationship between full-time national servicemen and the SAF in the context of the relevant statutory instruments and the applicable contractual principles. I then apply the law to the facts of this case.
The nature of the relationship between full-time national servicemen and the SAF
(1)   Statutory instruments
64     In my view, the nature of the relationship between full-time national servicemen and the SAF is undoubtedly statutory in nature. This becomes apparent upon examination of the statutory instruments that establish and govern the SAF and national service.
65     The SAF is established and organised pursuant to, 
inter alia
, s 7 of the Singapore Armed Forces Act (Cap 295, 2000 Rev Ed) (“the SAF Act”). The enlistment of persons in the SAF is governed by the EA. Under s 10(1) of the EA, the proper authority under the EA, 
viz
, the Armed Forces Council and any person or body appointed by it, may require by notice a person who is a Singaporean citizen or permanent resident not below the age of 18 years to report for enlistment for national service. A full-time national serviceman is a person who is enlisted in national service. Failure to comply with this notice would render the person guilty of an offence that carries with it a sentence of fine or imprisonment (see s 33(
a
) of the EA). In other words, national service is a matter of legislative compulsion.
66     Matters that would otherwise be governed by an employment contract, such as leave and duration of service are legislated for. Section 12 of the EA provides for the duration of national service. The number of days of vacation leave a full-time national serviceman may have is also provided for under reg 1(3) of the First Schedule of the Singapore Armed Forces (Leave) Regulations (Cap 295, Rg 12, 2001 Rev Ed).
67     Under s 205(
i
) of the SAF Act and s 37(2)(
a
) of the EA, the Armed Forces Council and the Minister are respectively empowered to make regulations pertaining to the payment of allowances of persons in national service. While there do not appear to be specific regulations governing the remuneration of full-time national servicemen, I note that in an affidavit filed by Ni De’En, the Deputy Director (National Service Policy) with the Manpower Division of the Ministry of Defence, on the Government of the Republic of Singapore’s behalf, the position concerning the remuneration of full-time national servicemen was stated to be as follows:
[note: 3]
[W]hile a full-time National Serviceman is given a National Service allowance during the period of his liability to serve full-time National Service, this allowance is meant to support the full-time National Serviceman for his basic personal upkeep. The allowance is neither a salary nor is it computed as a salary…
68     Furthermore, there are obligations imposed on a full-time national serviceman that are not consistent with an employment relationship based on contract. These include, for example, the requirement that all eligible persons register and be subject to a fitness examination for assessment of suitability for national service (see ss 3, 4 and 5 of the EA); the requirement for a full-time national serviceman to apply for an exit permit in certain circumstances when leaving Singapore (see s 32 of the EA read with reg 25 of the Enlistment Regulations (Cap 93, Rg 1, 1999 Rev Ed)); and the fact that a full-time national serviceman is subject to military law from the time of his liability to report for enlistment until such time of lawful discharge or release (see s 3(
a
) of the SAF Act). A person liable for full-time service and who is fit for national service is also liable to render operationally ready national service under ss 13 and 14 of the EA. These are significant because they demonstrate that statutory obligations are imposed both 
before
 and 
after
 a person enlists in the SAF. Indeed, they are imposed on a person by virtue of their citizenship or residency status in Singapore. Clearly, the terms of the relationship are statutorily prescribed.
69     It is also of note that it is constitutionally provided under art 10(2) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) that while all forms of forced labour are prohibited, Parliament may by law provide for 
compulsory
 service for national purposes. Furthermore, in contrast to national service which is a requirement imposed on qualifying persons under the EA, under s 19 of the EA, any person 
may apply
 to be enlisted for regular service in the SAF. In this regard, s 20(2) of the EA provides that “[n]o person shall be liable to render regular service in excess of the period for which 
he has applied
 to serve” [emphasis added].
70     To my mind, all the above are obvious indicia that full-time national service is a 
statutorily imposed duty
. This duty or obligation is imposed on qualifying persons in Singapore for the purposes of national security. The SAF is a statutorily created body and the relationship between the SAF and a full-time national serviceman is clearly governed by statute and subsidiary legislation.
(2)   Contractual principles
71     Having examined the statutory framework which governs the enlistment of qualifying persons into the SAF, I now consider contractual principles to ascertain if a contract of service exists between a full-time national serviceman and the SAF, in an ordinary case, 
in parallel
 with the statutory relationship.
72     Contract law encompasses a vast body of legal principles and rules which determine amongst other things, how and when a contract is formed, the ascertainment of the terms of the contract, the circumstances in which the contract may be vitiated or discharged, and the remedies for a breach of contract. Here, I briefly set out a general discussion on the applicable contractual principles.
73     There are generally speaking, four elements for the formation of a valid contract, being:
(a)     offer;
(b)     acceptance;
(c)     consideration; and
(d)     intention to create legal relations.
74     These four elements of the formation of a valid contract are based on the general vision of contract law as governing the 
voluntary
 entry between parties possessing capacity into legally binding agreements. The formation of a contract requires a meeting of minds or 
consensus ad idem
 between the offeror and the offeree. In 
Gay Choon Ing v Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter and another appeal
 
[2009] 2 SLR(R) 332
 (“
Gay Choon Ing
”), the Court of Appeal defined an offer as “a definite promise to be bound, provided that certain specified terms are accepted” and an acceptance as “a final and unqualified expression of assent to the terms of an offer” (at [47]).
75     The duty to enlist is a requirement imposed by statute and a breach of this duty renders a person liable to penalties such as a fine or a term of imprisonment under s 33 of the EA. It is artificial, in such circumstances, to characterise the relationship between the SAF and a full-time national serviceman who enlists due to the compulsion of the law as contractual relationship with a meeting of minds or 
consensus ad idem
 between the full-time national serviceman and the SAF. There is no freedom in the formation of the relationship which one would regard as a necessary ingredient in the formation of the consensual relationship that is a contract. As stated, enlistment is a matter of legislative compulsion. The fact that full-time national servicemen may enlist willingly and with the ardent intention of serving the nation does not change how the relationship is created or the nature of the relationship.
76     Even assuming that the elements of offer and acceptance can be satisfied, there is, in addition, an issue as to whether a full-time national serviceman has provided valid consideration for the alleged contract. I note that the modern approach in contract law requires little to find the existence of valid consideration (see 
Chwee Kin Keong and others v Digilandmall.com Pte Ltd
 
[2004] 2 SLR(R) 594
 at [139] 
per
 V K Rajah JC (as he then was)). However, there may be legal impediments to the finding of valid consideration, one of them being the fact that the promisee promises to perform (or performs) an existing duty imposed on the promisee 
by law
 (see 
Gay Choon Ing
 at [87]).
77     The position is succinctly explained in John Cartwright, 
Formation and Variation of Contracts: The Agreement, Formalities, Consideration and Promissory Estoppel
 (Sweet & Maxwell, 2014) at para 8–38:
Where the claimant is already under a statutory or other legal obligation to do what he undertakes to the defendant to do in return for the defendant’s promise, the courts will generally not accept that his undertaking constitutes good consideration.
… [T]he rejection of contractual liability where the claimant alleges that he provided consideration by promising or performing a duty which already lay upon him by the general law may be put in … general terms of absence of consideration: the promise or performance of a service which is required by law to be performed in favour of the defendant neither provides benefit to the defendant nor constitutes detriment to the claimant.
78     In the same vein, it is difficult to construe the full-time national serviceman’s promise to perform national service or the performance of national service, as valid consideration on the full-time national serviceman’s part so as to satisfy the element of consideration of a contract between him and the SAF where the full-time national serviceman is already under a statutory obligation to do so. Furthermore, the result of finding that a contract exists between the SAF and a full-time national serviceman would result in the curious consequence that the SAF would be entitled to sue the full-time national serviceman for damages for breach of that contract.
79     In my view, where a person enlists for national service with the SAF, neither the full-time national serviceman nor the SAF possesses any 
intention
 to enter into a 
contractual
 relationship with the attendant rights and obligations that flow from the presence of such a relationship. Instead, the enlistment of a full-time national serviceman in national service is an act done as a discharge of the duty imposed on him by s 10 of the EA, and cannot be construed as leading to the creation of a contractual relationship under the common law without more.
80     It must also be noted that there is no provision in the various applicable legislative instruments that imposes a 
statutory contract
 between the SAF and a full-time national serviceman. The position may be contrasted with the position under s 39(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) which provides:
 
Effect of constitution
 
39.—(1) Subject to this Act, the constitution of a company shall when registered bind the company and the members thereof to the same extent as if it respectively had been signed and sealed by each member and contained covenants on the part of each member to observe all the provisions of the constitution.
81     The effect of this provision is that under the Companies Act, a company is regarded as being in a contractual relationship with its members and the members of the company are also regarded as being in a contractual relationship with each other (Dan W Puchniak and Tan Cheng Han, “Company Law” 
(2013) 14 SAL Ann Rev 179
 at para 9.10). In a statutory contract such as that under s 39 of the Companies Act, the efficacy and the existence of the contract is derived from the statutory provisions. No similar provision exists with respect to full-time national servicemen, and accordingly there is no statutory contract between the SAF and a full-time national serviceman.
82     Finally, I come to Mr Choh’s submission that the contract may be characterised as a mandatory contract. As stated above, he relied on the cases of 
Sakinas
 and 
Yap Yew Cheong
 for this submission. With respect, Mr Choh’s reliance on these cases was misconceived. The reference to a “mandatory contract” in both these cases was a reference to the fact that the relevant statutes and regulations had laid down prescribed terms for the sale and purchase of condominium apartments which parties where required to adopt when entering into such transactions. It was not a situation where the underlying obligation itself, 
viz
, the purchase of the apartment, was a duty imposed by statute. Compulsory third-party motor insurance was also not a relevant example because that is an example of a situation where legislation mandates the 
purchase
 of third-party insurance; legislation does not 
govern the relationship between the insurer and the insured
, which falls to be determined by the rights and obligations the insurer and the insured have expressly agreed to under the relevant policy of insurance (though, again, the statutes and regulations may lay down certain guidelines for the terms of such insurance policies). Further, the requirement to purchase insurance only rises 
if and when a person decides to buy a motor vehicle
. There is no compulsion to purchase insurance otherwise.
(3)   Conclusion on the nature of the relationship between the SAF and a full-time national serviceman
83     In conclusion, I found that in the ordinary case, the nature of the relationship between the SAF and a full-time national serviceman is governed by the applicable legislation and regulations made thereunder. In the absence of special circumstances (such as the presence of a written contract), the SAF does not enter into any private, statutory or mandatory contract with the full-time national serviceman.
84     I am supported in this view by the comments made by P Coomaraswamy J in 
PQR v STR
 
[1992] 3 SLR(R) 744
 concerning the nature of national service. While these comments were made by Coomaraswamy J in the context of ancillary matters arising out of a divorce, they provide a useful insight into the legal nature of the relationship between a full-time national serviceman and the SAF. Section 125(
b
) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 1985 Rev Ed) provided that maintenance for a child would ordinarily expire upon the child obtaining “gainful employment”. The question that confronted the court in that case was whether a full-time national serviceman could be considered as being in “gainful employment” under that section. Coomaraswamy J stated (at [39]–[40]):
39    The elder son is currently in National Service. The question is whether National Service may be defined as “gainful employment” for the purpose of s 125(
b
) [of the Women’s Charter]. …
40    The key words here are “contract of service”. The national servicemen 
cannot be said to be under a contract of service in the ordinary sense. He is a conscript and the nature and length of service is determined by statue, the Enlistment Act, not by contract as is normal with employment
. Therefore, it would be quite inappropriate to consider National Service as “gainful employment” under s 125(
b
) of the Women’s Charter such that a parent’s legal duty to provide maintenance extinguishes upon the enlistment of the son under 21.
[emphasis added]
85     In this regard, it is also worth pointing out that the position in the United Kingdom appears to be that no contractual relationship of employment exists between a serviceman in the armed forces and the Crown (see generally 
Quinn v Ministry of Defence
 [1998] PIQR 387 at 396).
86     Finally, to recognise that the plaintiff has an action in breach of contract based on the particular facts of this case would be tantamount to allowing the plaintiff to circumvent the immunity of action afforded to the Government by s 14. Section 14 was enacted to account for the special position of the Government in relation to the defence of the nation. In the light of this, Parliament perceived it necessary to ensure that the Government would not be sued for, 
inter alia
, the negligent acts of members of the SAF that caused injury or death to other members where this occurred in the course of duty. To my mind, it would be antithetical to the purpose behind s 14 if the plaintiff’s contractual claim against the AG is recognised. In effect, recognising such a cause of action would be for the court to allow, through the backdoor, what the legislature has prohibited by the front. That would be an inappropriate exercise of the judicial function.
87     For the avoidance of doubt, my decision concerning the nature the relationship between full-time national servicemen and the SAF does 
not
 apply to a relationship between a regular serviceman (as defined by s 2 of the EA) and the SAF, which falls to be decided on another occasion.
The application of the legal principles to the facts of the case
88     I return now to the facts of the present case.
89     Aside from pleading that Mr Lee was a full-time national serviceman and that Mr Lee and the SAF entered into a contract of service, the plaintiff introduced no further particulars in the statement of claim to indicate that a contract had been formed. There was nothing in the pleadings or the affidavit evidence that indicated that Mr Lee’s enlistment into the SAF departed from the norm. I therefore found that the plaintiff’s claim in breach of contract against the AG was legally unsustainable. In the circumstances, I also allowed the AG’s application to strike out the relevant portions of the plaintiff’s statement of claim.
90     That said, it bears emphasis that this is not a situation where no compensation is payable. The immunity of D1, D2 and the Government under s 14(1) only arose when the Certificate was issued. The plaintiff is thus entitled to compensation under the Pensions Regulations. The entitlement of the plaintiff to compensation under the Pensions Regulations serves to alleviate the consequences of the immunity conferred under s 14(1) (see also [34(c)] above).
Conclusion
91     The circumstances of this case are undoubtedly tragic. It is about a life taken in the prime of youth, far too early and suddenly. I am mindful of the anguish, pain and grief that this has caused Mr Lee’s family and all who cherish him. It is perfectly understandable for Mr Lee’s parents to feel that their son has been wrongfully and prematurely taken from them and to direct their pain at those whom they feel were responsible. I have great sympathy for them.
92     Whilst the tragedy behind this case and the pain and anguish it has engendered should be recognised, we should not forget that this case also engages a matter of great importance – the ability of the SAF and its members to safeguard our nation and her security without being burdened by the yoke of tortious civil liability. Parliament has removed that yoke by enacting s 14 of the GPA, subject to safeguards and conditions. It is the responsibility of the courts to give effect to that legislative intention.
93     The immunity accorded by s 14 does not mean that the SAF and its officers have carte blanche to act without sufficient regard to the safety of the young men and women whose lives are entrusted to them. Indeed, to the contrary, the fact that such immunity exists in and of itself imposes an even heavier moral burden on the SAF and its officers to exercise utmost care in looking after their young charges. While it is critical that the integrity and robustness of SAF as a fighting force is not compromised by the spectre of tortious civil liability arising from the inevitable risk entailed by military training and operations, it must be remembered that a large proportion of our armed forces is made up of full-time national servicemen who make substantial personal sacrifice in serving Singapore. They must be assiduously protected and safeguarded. I am entirely convinced that the SAF and all who command it fully recognise the weight of that burden and do their very best to sedulously discharge it. However, despite the best intentions and careful and meticulous planning, mistakes can and unfortunately sometimes do happen. This is an ineluctable fact given the attendant risks that come with the terrain. This makes the 
raison d'être
 for the immunity under s 14 clear. However, Parliament has ameliorated the impact of the immunity by providing for compensation in the form of payment of an 
ex gratia
 sum through a military compensation framework, rather than having that extracted through the courts. That is the heart of this case and the legal reality that the plaintiff must unfortunately come to terms with no matter how difficult that may be.
94     In the circumstances, while I fully sympathised with the sufferings of Mr Lee’s family and friends, it was clear that the plaintiff’s case, as pleaded, was without reasonable prospect of success in law. For the above reasons, I allowed the Applications and dismissed the plaintiff’s suit.
95     On costs, Mr Singh and Mr Goh for D1 and D2 respectively submitted a sum of $6,000 for the costs for their respective applications and the action (inclusive of disbursements), each on a standard basis. Mr Jeyapal for the AG submitted that costs for its application and the action (inclusive of disbursements) ought to be $10,000 on a standard basis. Mr Choh did not substantially disagree, indicating in response that the sum for each of the defendants ought to be $6,000, amounting to $18,000 in total.
96     Costs followed the event and it was clear that the AG had taken on significantly more work for the Applications. It did not seem equitable that there should be parity of costs for all the defendants. The AG was entitled to more than D1 and D2. On quantum, the amounts sought were very much within the range of costs awarded for matters of this nature and complexity. Three factors were relevant in this regard. The costs were for the Applications and the action. Second, the Applications were fixed for a special half-day sitting which usually attracts a higher cost attribution. Third, the costs sought were inclusive of disbursements. Disbursements were indicated to be fairly substantial. For instance, disbursements on the AG’s part were close to $1,900. In the round, I felt that the costs sought by the defendants were reasonable. I therefore awarded costs of the respective applications and the action (inclusive of disbursements) to D1 and D2 ($6,000 each) and the AG ($10,000).

2904800,Dunshea v R [2016] NSWCCA 244,"Judgment


	
	BEAZLEY P: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons of Hidden AJ. I agree with Hidden AJ’s reasons and proposed orders.
	
	
	GARLING J: I agree with the orders proposed by Hidden AJ, including the aggregate, and indicative sentences identified.
	
	
	For my part, I am unpersuaded that Blackmore SC DCJ failed to have regard to, and take into account such remorse as was expressed by the applicant. I would not uphold the first ground of appeal.
	
	
	However, I entirely agree with Hidden AJ’s reasons for concluding that the parity ground has been made out. It is for that reason that I agree with the proposed resentencing.
	
	
	HIDDEN AJ: The applicant, Aaron Dunshea, pleaded guilty before Blackmore SC DCJ to the following charges:
	



	
	knowingly taking part in the supply of a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug known colloquially as “nexus”;
	
	
	knowingly taking part in the supply of a large commercial quantity of the prohibited drug, MDA or “ecstasy”.
	



	
	Each offence, under s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 15 years.
	
	
	In sentencing the applicant for the first count, his Honour took into account on a Form 1 two offences: the (deemed) supply of a quantity of methylamphetamine and the unauthorised possession of a prohibited firearm, a pistol. His Honour sentenced the applicant to an aggregate sentence of 12 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 8 years, commencing on 5 July 2012. The indicative sentences were 11 years with a non-parole period of 7 years for the first count, and 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years for the second count.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal against those sentences. Two co-offenders were dealt with subsequently by Hock DCJ. It will be necessary later to examine those sentences, as there is a ground of unjustified disparity between the applicant’s sentence and those passed upon the co-offenders.
	


Facts


	
	In February 2012, police began an investigation into the large scale supply of drugs by one David Boulghourjian. Telephone intercepts reveal that he was in regular contact with the applicant. An agreed statement of facts asserted that Boulghourjian was a principal in the enterprise, and that the applicant’s contribution was to assist in the supply of ecstasy, in collecting drug debts owing to Boulghourjian, and to store drugs for him.
	
	
	At some stage in April 2012, Boulghourjian supplied 5,000 tablets of nexus on credit to one Behrooz Ghasemi. Ghasemi did not pay for them and Boulghourjian wanted them returned. There were numerous intercepted calls between the two men and on 22 May Ghasemi returned about 2,861 tablets by delivering them to the applicant’s home at Beecroft. In the meantime, on 17 May, the applicant, under the direction of Boulghourjian, bought a number of items commonly associated with drug dealing: a set of electronic scales, a home vacuum packaging system, rolls of vacuum bags, and a plastic roll storage holder and cutter.
	
	
	On 24 May, police executed search warrants at the homes of the applicant and Boulghourjian. At the applicant’s home they located, in all, 809.17 grams of nexus and 2,537.39 grams of ecstasy. The wholesale value of the nexus was estimated at $37,591, although its retail value would have been significantly higher, and the wholesale value of the ecstasy was estimated at $108,514. These were the subject of the first and second counts. Also found were 14.81 grams of methylamphetamine and a .45 calibre Ruger pistol, the Form 1 matters. It was accepted that the applicant had been minding that weapon for Boulghourjian. Paraphernalia associated with drug dealing was also located.
	
	
	His Honour noted the acknowledgement in the agreed facts that the applicant was not a principal in the drug dealing operation, but he characterised him as a “knowing and willing participant” in a “very significant drug operation”. He saw the applicant’s role to have been “to warehouse the drugs and other items, including the gun, as requested by” Boulghourjian.
	


Subjective case


	
	The applicant was 27 years old at the time of the offences, and is now 32. He had a minor criminal history for possession of prohibited drugs.
	
	
	He is one of three children, and enjoyed the continuing support of his parents and siblings. He had been in a relationship with a young woman, who also remained supportive of him. He left school at year 10, but subsequently completed a diploma in business marketing. However, in the first few years after leaving school he did not work due to poor motivation because of his drug use. He then obtained work for some years until he went into a property development business with his brother. Unfortunately, that business failed.
	
	
	In his early teens, he began a pattern of binge drinking and using cannabis, and in the years that followed his drug use increased and widened to include amphetamines and methamphetamine. He also used “crack” cocaine, and his abuse of that drug increased after the failure of the business. At the time of the offences he was using drugs heavily.
	
	
	There were a number of distressing episodes in his life. It seems that he felt responsible for the collapse of the business, which left him and his brother in substantial debt, because the venture had been his idea. More importantly, he was affected by the death of a number of young friends over a period, including a former girlfriend who had committed suicide.
	
	
	After coming into custody following his arrest for these offences he was treated for depression. He ceased his drug use, and had completed a drug and alcohol program. He had expressed his desire to undergo further drug and alcohol counselling and to take part in a further program. In the light of this, and the support offering to him by his family, the sentencing judge determined that he had good prospects of rehabilitation. There was also considerable evidence of his remorse for his offending, to which his Honour did not refer in his remarks on sentence. This is the subject of the first ground of appeal.
	


The application


	
	Mr Game SC, who appeared with Mr Barrow for the applicant, argued two grounds of appeal:
	



	
	that the sentencing Judge erred in failing to consider or take into account the applicant’s remorse;
	
	
	that the sentences imposed upon the co-offenders give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the applicant.
	


Remorse


	
	There was considerable evidence of remorse on the part of the applicant. In a letter to his Honour he expressed himself to be “deeply regretful and sorry for my actions, which I know have severely impacted my family, the community and myself, and have left the community with the burden of having to support me whilst in custody ….”. In a psychological report which was in evidence he was said to have “expressed both regret and remorse for his offences,” and to have stated that he “understands the seriousness of his offences….”. He added that he had let his family and himself down, and reported that he “understands that drugs cost people their lives, the community money and devastate both the user and their families.”
	
	
	There were a number of testimonials to his character in evidence, including one from his older brother. His brother wrote that he had “learned the lesson of what drugs have inflicted upon not only his life but his family’s as well”, and that he “can now view the damage that some of the people that he was hanging around with have done to their own lives.” His partner, Ms Sanchez, wrote that he ”knows of the wrong he has done and accepts that he must be punished for this.” A long standing friend, David Wilkins, who visited him in prison on numerous occasions, noticed that “his demeanour showed a genuine sense of remorse for the pain he has caused his family, his friends, and further the community at large.” Mr Nathan Kachwalla, a youth worker who had known him for several years, observed him to be “a young man who was deeply remorseful for his actions and determined to live a positive life….”. A hotel manager and friend of some years, Mr Arvind Pillay, wrote that he “seems to be showing a heavy remorse as well as a better level of understanding that what he did was wrong and what steps he can try and achieve to be a better person.”
	
	
	Remorse was one of the issues dealt with in written submissions on the applicant’s behalf by counsel appearing for him in the District Court. In his remarks his Honour allowed a 25% reduction of sentence on account of the applicant’s pleas of guilty, but did not refer to any of this material and, as I have said, did not address the issue of remorse at all.
	
	
	The evidence clearly entitled the applicant to have his remorse taken into account in accordance with s 21A(3)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which provides as a matter of mitigation:
	


“(i)   the remorse shown by the offender for the offence, but only if:


	
	the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions, and
	
	
	the offender has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions or made reparation for such injury, loss or damage (or both),”
	



	
	Plainly enough, the applicant had provided evidence that he had accepted responsibility for his actions and acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by him. As to s 21A, all his Honour said in his remarks was that, while he had not referred to the section in detail, he had “taken those factors into account on sentence.” It is, of course, well recognised that District Court judges, bearing a heavy daily burden of sentencing matters, are entitled to be concise in delivering remarks on sentence and are not expected to engage in lengthy analysis of the issues involved. Equally, it is well recognised that ex tempore remarks on sentence, as the remarks in the present case were, should be scrutinised with a degree of latitude.
	
	
	The Crown prosecutor in this Court referred us to Church v R [2012] NSWCCA 149, in which one of the complaints was that a sentencing judge had failed to take into account adverse publicity about the applicant as a form of extra-curial punishment. This ground was dealt with by Button J, delivering the leading judgment, at [29] ff. The publicity had been referred to in a psychiatric report, and had been raised in oral submissions by the applicant’s legal representative in the District Court. The sentencing judge had delivered his remarks on sentence ex tempore.
	
	
	Button J said at [35] that he was not persuaded that the sentencing judge had failed to take into account the media attention and its effects on the applicant. He noted that the applicant had made oral submissions about the matter very shortly before sentence was passed, and thought it unlikely that the judge had forgotten or disregarded what the solicitor had said. He also noted that the judge had referred in general to the strong subjective case which had been advanced through a pre-sentence report and the psychiatric report: [35].
	
	
	His Honour continued, in a passage relied upon by the Crown prosecutor in the present case, at [36]:
	


“It is true that it is incumbent on a sentencing judge or magistrate to explain his or her findings and reasons in the remarks on sentence. But that does not mean that, wherever there is a failure to refer to any fact or topic in the remarks on sentence, one must infer that the matter was not taken into account, and error is thereby established. Remarks on sentence should not be unnecessarily lengthy, and on many occasions can be succinct, even in the District Court. Their purpose is to explain to the offender, the persons present in court, and the wider community, why the sentencing judge or magistrate is imposing the sentence that will immediately follow. Remarks on sentence should not have to recite laboriously all of the evidence given or tendered, the facts found, or the legal principles applied, for fear of committing an error by omission. The mere fact that a matter has not been mentioned in the remarks on sentence does not of itself found an appeal to this Court.”


	
	The Crown prosecutor also submitted that remorse was subsumed within the issue of rehabilitation, which his Honour clearly did address. He referred to Stojanovski v R [2013] NSWCCA 334, in which there was a complaint that the sentencing judge had failed to take into account remorse. There had been considerable evidence of rehabilitation in that case, which the sentencing judge had addressed in his remarks. There was also evidence of remorse to be found in the oral evidence of the applicant and a psychological report. Simpson J (as she then was), delivering the leading judgment, dealt with this ground at [39]-[41]. In rejecting the ground, her Honour said at [41]:
	


“In my opinion, remorse is to be seen as a mitigating factor because it is a concomitant of rehabilitation, meaning that future offending is unlikely or less likely. Rehabilitation was treated by his Honour in some depth. Even if his Honour had expressly referred to, and accepted, the evidence of remorse as an independent factor, it could not have had any real bearing on the outcome.”


	
	The Crown prosecutor noted his Honour’s reference to the applicant’s favourable subjective case, the finding of his good prospects of rehabilitation and of special circumstances, warranting a departure from the statutory proportion between sentence and non-parole period, in recognition of his need for drug rehabilitation and psychological treatment to foster that rehabilitation. No doubt, the Crown prosecutor argued, the applicant’s expressions of remorse were taken into account in assessing his prospects of rehabilitation, and the fact that his Honour did not expressly refer to them does not disclose error.
	
	
	It is important to understand the observations of Button J in Church and Simpson J in Stojanovski in their context. In each case they were observations made in the light of the facts of the case at hand, and they should not be elevated into statements of principle having general application. In this matter the applicant’s remorse was an important part of his case on sentence, deserving to be addressed in his Honour’s reasons. Of course, there is a considerable degree of overlap between remorse and rehabilitation but they remain distinct factors bearing on sentence. So much is apparent from the scheme of s 21A(3), requiring a sentencing court to take into account rehabilitation: par (h) and remorse: (i).
	
	
	Accordingly, this ground is made out. That being so, it is not strictly necessary to consider the next ground as this Court must resentence in its own discretion, taking into account the sentences passed upon the co-offenders. However, I consider it appropriate to deal with the ground.
	


Parity


	
	After the applicant was sentenced, the co-offenders, Boulghourjian and Ghasemi, were sentenced by Hock DCJ. They were dealt with after being found guilty at trial of counts of supplying a large commercial quantity of nexus and ecstasy, related to the counts of knowingly taking part in supply of those drugs to which the applicant had pleaded guilty. (Boulghourjian was also found guilty of two further supply offences of a minor nature, which are of no significance for present purposes.)
	
	
	The facts found by Hock DCJ for the purpose of sentence were broadly consistent with those in the applicant’s case. Between the end of March and late May 2012, Boulghourjian supplied nexus and ecstasy on credit to Ghasemi for him to on-sell. When Ghasemi was unable to provide to Boulghourjian the money for drugs sold, or unable to sell the drugs within a time which Boulghourjian regarded as reasonable, Boulghourjian told Ghasemi to return the drugs to the applicant’s home, described as a “safe house”. Her Honour referred to the return of the nexus tablets on 22 May, and to the search of the applicant’s home by police officers on 24 May. However, for reasons which are not clear, the evidence before her Honour was that the total weight of ecstasy found at the premises was 1,479.9 grams, considerably less than the amount asserted in the applicant’s case, 2,537.39 grams.
	
	
	Her Honour found each of the two men to have been engaged in trafficking to a significant degree over a period of about two months, Boulghourjian being at a “higher level in the distribution chain” than Ghasemi on the basis that he was providing drugs to Ghasemi to on-sell and also giving him instructions. Her Honour had regard to the sentence passed upon the applicant in the light of the facts in his case and the reduction of sentence he had earned for his pleas of guilty. She noted the higher amount of ecstasy involved and the offence of possession of a prohibited pistol on the Form 1. She considered him to be at “a slightly lower level” than Boulghourjian and Ghasemi, being characterised as “a storeman or warehouser ...”
	
	
	Boulghourjian was sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment of 10 years with a non-parole period of 7 years. The indicative sentences were 9 years with a non-parole period of 6 years for the nexus offence, and 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 ½ years for the ecstasy offence. (Sentences of 6 months and 3 months respectively were indicated for the other two offences.)
	
	
	Ghasemi was sentenced to an aggregate term of 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 ½ years. The indicative sentences were 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 ½ years for the nexus offence, and 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years for the ecstasy offence.
	
	
	There was no marked difference between the subjective cases of the three men, although the applicant’s was the most favourable, given his pleas of guilty and his good prospects of rehabilitation. However, the question of disparity turns primarily upon the involvement of each of them in the offences.
	
	
	The principles governing appellate intervention on the basis of disparity of sentence are well known. They were summarised helpfully by Garling J, with reference to authority, in Rees v R [2012] NSWCCA 47 at [50] and need not be repeated. The basal question is whether the more lenient sentences passed upon Boulghourjian and Ghasemi engender in the applicant a justifiable sense of grievance, so that it appears that justice has not been done.
	
	
	The disparity between the applicant’s aggregate sentence of 12 years with a non-parole period of 8 years and the sentences passed upon his co-offenders is certainly marked. Particularly is this so when one has regard to the 25% reduction of sentence he was afforded for his pleas of guilty. Judge Blackmore said that, but for those pleas, a “total sentence of at least 16 years imprisonment would have been applied.” Equally, there is marked disparity between the applicant’s indicative sentences, 11 years with a non-parole period of 7 years on the first count, and 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years on the second count, and the sentences indicated for the co-offenders.
	
	
	True it is, as Judge Hock observed and as was emphasised by the Crown prosecutor in this Court, the amount of ecstasy the subject of the charge in the applicant’s case was considerably greater than that in the case of the co-offenders, and there was the additional offence of possession of a prohibited weapon taken into account in the applicant’s sentence. Moreover, apart from his role as warehouseman, the applicant had also been Boulghourjian’s debt collector. However, making due allowance for those differences, and while noting that the applicant’s possession of the pistol was part of his warehousing task, I am satisfied that the disparity cannot be justified. Particularly is this so in relation to Ghasemi’s sentence.
	
	
	The applicant’s aggregate sentence is 2 years longer than that imposed on Boulghourjian and 4 years longer than that imposed on Ghasemi. The applicant’s non-parole period is 1 year longer than Boulghourjian’s and 2 ½ years longer than Ghasemi’s. As to the indicative sentences, for the nexus offence the applicant’s head sentence exceeds Boulghourjian’s by 2 years and Ghasemi’s by 4 years, and the non-parole period exceeds Boulghourjian’s by 1 year and Ghasemi’s by 2 ½ years. As to the ecstasy offence, the applicant’s indicated head sentence exceeds Boulghourjian’s by 1 year and Ghasemi’s by 2 years, and his non-parole period exceeds Boulghourjian’s by 6 months and Ghasemi’s by 2 years. These figures, I might add, are a comparison of the applicant’s discounted sentences with the undiscounted sentences of the co-offenders.
	
	
	I would uphold this ground.
	


Resentence


	
	For the purpose of resentence, it is clear that the criminality of Boulghourjian, as a principal in the enterprise, stands above that of the applicant and Ghasemi. However, the Crown prosecutor submitted that the applicant’s continuing role as warehouseman and debt collector is more proximate to that of Boulghourjian than Ghasemi who, he argued, appears to have been something of a failure as a drug supplier on credit. Nevertheless, I would accept Judge Hock’s characterisation of Ghasemi as having been engaged in trafficking to a significant degree over the relevant period of about two months.
	
	
	I am persuaded by the submissions of Mr Game that, while regard must be had to the additional quantity of ecstasy in the applicant’s case and the matters on the Form 1, his lesser role than that of Boulghourjian, his early pleas of guilty, his remorse and favourable prospects of rehabilitation point to an aggregate sentence significantly less than Boulghourjian’s and reasonably proximate to Ghasemi’s.
	
	
	I would grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal and quash the sentence passed in the District Court. I would resentence the applicant to an aggregate sentence of 9 years, comprising a non-parole period of 6 years and a balance of term of 3 years, commencing on 5 July 2012. The indicative sentences would be:
	



	
	knowingly taking part in the supply of a large commercial quantity of nexus, taking into account the matters on the Form 1: 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years;
	
	
	knowingly taking part in the supply of a large commercial quantity of ecstasy: 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years.

IN THE FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA         QUEENSLAND DISTRICT REGISTRY         GENERAL DIVISION   QUD 116 of 2009        BETWEEN:   LOUISE STODDART Applicant       AND:   WILLIAM MCLEAN BOULTON (EXAMINER, AUSTRALIAN CRIME COMMISSION) First Respondent   AUSTRALIAN CRIME COMMISSION Second Respondent           JUDGE:   REEVES J     DATE:   1 october 2009     PLACE:   BRISBANE    REASONS FOR JUDGMENT introduction 1                     Mr Ewan Stoddart and Ms Louise Stoddart are husband and wife.  In late March 2009, Ms Stoddart was served with a summons requiring her to appear before Mr Boulton, an Australian Crime Commission examiner, to give evidence about her husband’s business activities. 2                     Ms Stoddart appeared before Mr Boulton on 3 April 2009 and refused to answer any questions.  She did so claiming that she was protected by a common law privilege or immunity against her incriminating her husband.  Mr Boulton did not accept Ms Stoddart’s claim to this privilege, ruling that if spousal privilege did exist at common law, the provisions of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth) had abrogated it.  As a consequence, Ms Stoddart has now sought: (1)               A declaration in this Court that the common law privilege or immunity against spousal incrimination has not been abrogated by the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth); and (2)               An injunction restraining the Examiner of the Australian Crime Commission from questioning her in relation to matters concerning Ewan Alisdair James Stoddart. ISSUES 3                     To succeed in obtaining the declaration and injunction she has sought, Ms Stoddart must show that: (1)               spousal privilege or immunity exists at common law; and (2)               that common law privilege has not been abrogated by s 30 of the Act. 4                     I will turn to consider each of these issues in order. does spousal privilege exist at common law? 5                     The resolution of this first issue revolves around two relatively recent appeal court decisions to which I was referred by both counsel:  Ms Martin for Ms Stoddart and Mr Cooke QC for the Crime Commission. 6                     First, in Callanan v B [2005] 1 Qd R 348 (“B”), the Queensland Court of Appeal unanimously held that spousal privilege existed at common law:  see McMurdo JA at [1], McPherson JA at [8] and Jerrard JA at [22].  That decision involved a refusal by a spouse to answer questions asked in the course of a crime investigation being conducted under the Crime and Misconduct Act 2001 (Qld) (‘the Qld Act’).  In their decisions, McPherson and Jerrard JJA relied extensively on an article by Mr D Lusty entitled “Is there a common law privilege against spousal incrimination?” (2004) 27 UNSWLJ 1. 7                     Secondly, in S v Boulton (2006) 151 FCR 364 (“S”), a Full Court of this Court came to the same conclusion:  see Black CJ at [16] to [28], Jacobsen J at [75] to [99] and Greenwood J at [171].  While the central issue in S was whether spousal privilege extended to a de facto spouse, the Full Court had to determine, as a necessary first step, whether spousal privilege existed at all. 8                     At first instance in S ((2005) 155 A Crim R 152), Kiefel J considered she should follow the decision in B as a matter of judicial comity (at [31] and [32]), even though her Honour was of the view that the common law did not recognise the concept of spousal privilege:  see at [25]. 9                     In his decision in S, Black CJ examined the difficulties identified by Kiefel J with the existence of spousal privilege:  see at [17] to [22].  In particular, his Honour noted the comments made by Kiefel J about the confusion created by statements that had related compellability to privilege:  see at [20].  Furthermore, he noted the historical difficulty with the existence of a spousal privilege when the earlier common law rules relating to spousal incompetence and non-compellability meant that it would almost never have arisen for consideration:  see at [19].  Ultimately, the Chief Justice concluded that Bshould be followed:  see at [25] and [28].    In reaching this conclusion, his Honour noted that: ●          there were differing opinions as to whether a definitive modern spousal privilege existed; ●          there was one common law in Australia; ●          there was a need for certainty in its interpretation;  ●          the decision in B had not been contradicted; ●          it involved a careful analysis of the relevant legal history; and ●          it was based on a scholarly article on the subject. 10                  Jacobson J, with whom Greenwood J agreed, traced the historical evolution of the notions of competence, compellability and privilege and concluded that the common law did recognise a spousal incrimination privilege:  see at [99].  Jacobson J noted the uncertainty surrounding the notions of compellability and privilege raised by Kiefel J (at [93]) but respectfully disagreed with her Honour as to what flowed from the proposition that a wife was not compellable as a witness:  see at [98].  Jacobson J relied particularly on the decision of Barley J in R v Inhabitants of All Saints Worcester (1817) 105 ER 1215 and concluded that spousal privilege was related to non-compellability:  see [91].  It should, perhaps, be noted that Kiefel J had doubted the correctness of this decision:  see the reasons of Kiefel J at [15]. 11                  In addition to these two appeal court decisions, it is worth mentioning that in Stoten v Sage (2005) 144 FCR 487 (“Stoten”), Dowsett J essentially took the same approach as Kiefel J in S.  While his Honour doubted the existence of such a common law privilege independent of statute, for reasons of judicial comity, he decided he should follow the decision in B:  see Stoten at [6] and [14]. 12                  Since the resolution of this issue was a necessary part of the decision in S and, therefore, part of the ratio decidendi, I consider I am bound to follow the Full Court’s decision in that case.  Even if I were not so bound, I would not be so bold as to ignore the principle of judicial comity in relation to the decision in B, when, as I have noted above, five judges of this Court have recently followed it.  It follows that I should hold that spousal privilege or immunity does exist at common law. has spousal privilege been abrogated by section 30 of the acc act? 13                  Unlike the first issue, this second issue has not been determined conclusively by an intermediate appeal court, or by the High Court. 14                  Section 30 of the Act, relevantly provides:              (1)  A person served, as prescribed, with a summons to appear as a witness at an examination before an examiner shall not:                      (a)  fail to attend as required by the summons; or                      (b)  fail to attend from day to day unless excused, or released from further attendance, by the examiner. Failure to answer questions etc.              (2)  A person appearing as a witness at an examination before an examiner shall not:                      (a)  when required pursuant to section 28 either to take an oath or make an affirmation—refuse or fail to comply with the requirement;                      (b)  refuse or fail to answer a question that he or she is required to answer by the examiner; or                      (c)  refuse or fail to produce a document or thing that he or she was required to produce by a summons under this Act served on him or her as prescribed. 15                  On this issue, Ms Martin essentially relied upon the views expressed by Black CJ in S to the effect that: ●          spousal privilege had not been expressly abrogated by s 30 of the Act (see at [57]); ●          he would be slow to conclude that s 30 of the Act abrogated spousal privilege by necessary implication (at [58]); and ●          if it were necessary to decide the point, he would conclude that spousal privilege was a separate and distinct privilege and a fundamental right to which Parliament did not turn its attention when enacting the Act:  see at [59]. 16                  At this point, it is convenient to note that Ms Martin acknowledged that these views of Black CJ in S were obita dictum and the other two judges in that case, also in obita dicta, took the opposite point of view.  Jacobsen J reviewed various authorities (S at [140] to [156]), including the Full Court decision in A v Boulton (2004) 136 FCR 420 (“A”) (particularly the decision of Kenny J) and the decision of Dowsett J in Stoten.  His Honour then concluded (S at [152] to [156]) that the general and unqualified obligation to answer questions expressed in s 30(2) of the Act, considered in the context of the character and purpose of the legislation, its legislative history and the Explanatory Memorandum on the 2002 amendments to the Act, was sufficient to abrogate spousal privilege. 17                  For his part, Greenwood J agreed generally with the reasons of Jacobsen J (S at [170]) and concluded (S at [173]) that s 30 of the Act had the effect of excluding the operation of spousal privilege.  While Ms Martin submitted that Greenwood J did not provide any reasons for his conclusion at [173], I reject that submission because I consider his Honour, at [170], clearly adopted the reasons of Jacobsen J on this issue. 18                  Ms Martin also relied on B to the extent that the Queensland Court of Appeal held that the Qld Act did not abrogate the privilege against spousal incrimination.  Ms Martin submitted that the Act and the Qld Act are essentially synonymous for present purposes, as both abrogate self-incrimination privilege and make no mention of spousal privilege. 19                  On this aspect, Mr Cooke QC submitted that the decision in B was distinguishable for two main reasons.  First, while it was held in B that, on a plain reading of the relevant section of the Qld Act that purported to prevent a person refusing to answer a question on the grounds of privilege (s 190(2)(b)), it may be inferred that the intention of Parliament was to abrogate all forms of privilege (except legal professional privilege), the Dictionary meaning of the word ‘privilege’ in the Qld Act used the word ‘means’ (instead of ‘includes’) and specifically mentioned only two forms of privilege:  self-incrimination and legal professional.   McPherson JA said this produced a ‘clumsy’ result (at [12]), the effect of which he described at [13] as follows: The problem created by the intrusion of the Dictionary meaning is that, possibly inadvertently, it produces a limiting effect on s 190(2)(b).                         And at [14]: …. the superimposition of the definition of privilege in sch.2 renders it uncertain precisely which forms of privilege were intended to be abolished and which of them preserved. 20                  McPherson JA, therefore, concluded that the Qld Act did not abrogate spousal incrimination privilege by clear words or necessary implication:  see at [15].  On this issue, McMurdo JA agreed with McPherson JA (at [1]) and Jerrard JA came to a similar conclusion:  see at [23]. 21                  Secondly, Mr Cooke QC submitted that the Qld Act was in fact quite different to the Act.  In particular, s 194(1)(a) of the Qld Act excused a witness from answering questions in circumstances where that witness had a ‘reasonable excuse’ for refusing to answer.  So, he submitted, unlike s 30 of the Act, the Qld Act did not impose upon a witness an unqualified obligation to answer questions.  He submitted this difference was significant in discerning a legislative intention to exclude the common law privilege by necessary implication.  Mr Cooke QC also submitted that, because of the ‘reasonable excuse’ defence, even if the confusion surrounding the definition of ‘privilege’ had not arisen, there would have been stronger grounds for the argument that the Qld Act did not abrogate the privilege against spousal incrimination, than there were available in relation to the Act. 22                  On this issue, Mr Cooke QC also submitted that the Full Court’s decision in A emphasised the unqualified obligation to answer questions established by s 30(2) of the Act.  In this regard, he particularly pointed to the observations of Kenny J at [58] as follows: Pursuant to s 30(2) of the Act, the obligation to answer a question that the examiner requires an examinee to answer is expressed in general terms.  The purpose of an examination would, in large part, be defeated if the obligation expressed in s 30(2) were subject to the privilege …             And at [59] The language of s 30(2) is apt to create not only a general but also an unqualified obligation to provide answers when required. 23                  As well, Mr Cooke QC relied upon Stoten where Dowsett J detailed the legislative history of s 30(2) of the Act (at [21] to [27]) and concluded (at [29]): It is quite clear from the Explanatory Memorandum and the Second Reading Speeches that, in deleting the concept of reasonable excuse and otherwise amending s 30, Parliament intended to establish a regime in which all questions posed by an examiner were to be answered, subject only the express provisions of s 30. 24                  I would add that, as with Jacobsen J in S, Dowsett J also referred (Stoten at [30]) to the decision of Kenny J in A – his Honour was also a member of the Full Court in A – and concluded: It is difficult to see any logical reason for the Parliament to have abrogated privilege against self-incrimination but retain spousal privilege. 25                  Ms Martin attempted to deal with Stoten by submitting that Dowsett J had erred in that he had conceived of spousal privilege as an extension of the privilege against self-incrimination and concluded that, because the latter had been abrogated by the Act, spousal privilege had been too. 26                  What seemed to be at the heart of Ms Martin’s submissions was that spousal privilege was a separate and distinct privilege from self-incrimination privilege and, consequently, on basic principle, the legislature could not abrogate the common law spousal privilege unless it did so by express provision or necessary implication.  It followed that since s 30 made no express provision to abrogate spousal privilege, in order for it to be abrogated by necessary implication there would need to be evidence of a clear and unmistakable intention on the part of the legislature (see HKSAR v Lee Ming Tee (2001) 4 HKCFAR 133 at [55]).  Furthermore, Ms Martin submitted that the express reference to self-incrimination privilege and the associated protections in s 30(4) and s 30(5) of the Act highlighted the fact that Parliament was only concerned to abrogate that type of privilege while leaving others untouched. 27                  Before concluding on this issue, it is also worth mentioning that, during the unsuccessful special leave application in S v Boulton (see [2006] HCA Trans 665), Hayne J made a brief but telling comment, as follows: Can I tell you bluntly what troubles me most?  If the person who is incriminated by the answer has no privilege, save the limited use immunity for which the Act proscribes, why should someone who is not incriminated be outside the reach of the otherwise general obligation to answer what you are asking?  That is the nub of it for me. 28                  Notwithstanding the support Ms Martin is able to gain from the views of Black CJ in S, I consider the observations of Hayne J, Dowsett J and Kenny J (set out above) are highly persuasive on this issue.  In particular, whether spousal privilege is derived from self-incrimination privilege, or is a separate and distinct type of privilege based, as Ms Martin submits, on the unity of the family, the ultimate purpose of both is to prevent the husband (in this case) being incriminated.  If this is so, it would be perverse, in my view, for the legislature to abrogate the husband’s privilege against self-incrimination in s 30 of the Act, such that he must answer and thereby incriminate himself directly by his own words, and yet, to keep in place his wife’s privilege not to incriminate him (not herself) indirectly by her words.  Furthermore, as Mr Cooke QC pointed out, it would be somewhat surprising if the ends of marital and family harmony were to be given a higher level of protection under the Act, than the perseveration of personal liberty. CONCLUsion 29                  For these reasons, I conclude that s 30 of the Act has abrogated spousal privilege by necessary implication.  Having reached this conclusion, it necessarily follows that I do not consider that Ms Stoddart is entitled to the declaration and injunction she has sought.  I therefore order that this application be dismissed with costs.      I certify that the preceding twenty-nine (29) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Reeves.

3111140,R v Davis (No 2) [2016] NSWSC 1785,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: Garry Steven Davis (""the offender"") was arraigned before me on 29 August 2016 and pleaded not guilty to the following counts in the indictment:
	


1.   Murder of Ms Gwendolyne Fowler contrary to s 18 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).

2.   Administer poison with intent to murder Ms Audrey Manuel contrary to s 27 of the Crimes Act.

3.   Murder of Mr Ryan Kelly contrary to s 18 of the Crimes Act.


	
	The offender stood trial before me without a jury. On 28 September 2016 I returned verdicts of guilty on each count: R v Davis [2016] NSWSC 1362. The offender is now to be sentenced for each of those offences.
	
	
	The crime of murder is one that carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life (s 19A of the Crimes Act) and a standard non-parole period of 20 years. The offence of administer a poison with intent to murder carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 10 years. These are the statutory guideposts that I must bear in mind when assessing the appropriate sentences to be imposed in the light of all of the relevant facts and circumstances.
	


Facts


	
	A detailed analysis of the evidence in the circumstantial Crown case can be found within my reasons for verdict. My task now is to set out the facts upon which the offender is to be sentenced.
	


Overview


	
	The offender was employed as a Team Leader Certificate IV Aged Care worker at SummitCare aged care facility at Wallsend. There are four wards at SummitCare which provide for up to 142 residents. The victim of each offence was a resident in the Mountview ward.
	
	
	In short, the offender injected Ms Gwendolyne Fowler on 18 October 2013 and Ms Audrey Manuel and Mr Ryan (""Greg"") Kelly on 19 October with insulin in a non-therapeutic setting. Each victim was subsequently found in a hypoglycaemic state. Medical attention was promptly provided in each instance but Ms Fowler and Mr Kelly could not be saved.
	
	
	The sole issue at trial was the identity of the person who injected the victims. There was no dispute that each victim was deliberately injected with insulin and that there was no medical need for it. In these circumstances, it was common ground that the person who injected the victims did so with an intention to kill. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this was the case.
	


Expert evidence


	
	A number of medical expert witnesses gave evidence in the trial. As I have indicated, there was no dispute that each victim received an injection of insulin. Testing was inconclusive as to which specific type of insulin was used. Uniformity in the medical opinion indicated that long-acting insulin was used; it was uncertain, however, whether this was in conjunction with fast-acting insulin. Nonetheless, it was clear that the injections occurred up to about eight hours before the victims displayed significant symptoms of hypoglycaemia. This meant that Ms Fowler was injected sometime after about 8.00am on Friday 18 October; Ms Manuel was injected sometime after about 3.30am on Saturday 19 October; and Mr Kelly was injected that day sometime after about 7.00am. The offender was at work on both days from about 6.30am until about 3.00 to 3.30pm.
	


Gwendolyne Fowler - 18 October 2013


	
	Ms Gwendolyne Fowler was aged 83. She suffered from Alzheimer's disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis. Her general practitioner visited her on Thursday 17 October 2013 and observed her to be in reasonable health given her condition.
	
	
	On the morning of Friday 18 October Ms Fowler was attended to by nursing staff in the ordinary way. They noticed nothing untoward about her. At lunch time she became frustrated with a staff member assisting her to eat; there was a verbal outburst and she attempt to bite the staff member. The staff member was not troubled by this, being of the opinion it was not out of character for Ms Fowler. A different staff member who observed the interaction was of a contrary opinion, believing it to be odd.
	
	
	Apart from the lunchtime encounter, everything seemed normal until Ms Fowler's daughter, Ms Julie Ross, came to visit at 4pm. Ms Ross found Ms Fowler in her room in a state that prompted her to seek immediate assistance from nursing staff.
	
	
	Ms Fowler was suffering from hypoglycaemia and she was taken to hospital. She was later returned to SummitCare that evening for palliative care, ultimately passing away at about 12.50pm the following day. There were no suspicions about Ms Fowler's death until after Ms Manuel and Mr Kelly were taken to hospital with similar symptoms.
	
	
	An autopsy revealed the direct cause of Ms Fowler's death was ""bilateral bronchopneumonia"" with the antecedent causes being ""hypoglycaemia"" and ""insulin overdose"".
	


Audrey Manuel - 19 October 2013


	
	Ms Audrey Manuel was aged 91. Ms Manuel was a dementia patient who also suffered from osteoporosis, depression, glaucoma and gastro-oesophageal reflux. Ms Manuel's doctor visited her on Thursday 17 October and she appeared to be very well, consistent with her medical condition.
	
	
	On the morning of Saturday 19 October Ms Manuel was attended to in the usual manner and everything appeared normal.
	
	
	The first time Ms Manuel was observed to be in a ""confused"" state compared to normal was at about 10.30am when she was sitting in the foyer of the ward. This was supported by the observations of another staff member at around 11.15am. At 11.30am Ms Michelle Sutherland was visiting her mother who was a resident of SummitCare. Ms Sutherland noted that Ms Manuel did not respond to an attempt to gain her attention. Ms Manuel's hand began to shake and then it became more pronounced. The offender, who was nearby in the nurses' station, noticed the trembling and came over. His attempts to gain a response from Ms Manuel were unsuccessful. Other staff came to assist and the registered nurse took charge.
	
	
	Ms Manuel was at this stage hypoglycaemic and hypothermic. She was taken to hospital where testing and clinical observations concluded that her symptoms were caused by the administration of a very high dose of insulin.
	
	
	Ms Manuel remained in hospital until 1 November 2013. Her condition improved but she never attained the same level of functioning she had prior to her admission; her prognosis was poor. She was transferred to a different hospital before being moved to another nursing home where she later passed away from unrelated causes.
	


Ryan (""Greg"") Kelly - 19 October 2013


	
	Mr Ryan (""Greg"") Kelly was 80 years old. His medical conditions included Alzheimer's dementia, ischaemic heart disease and hypertension. He was observed to be in his usual health in the days leading up to the incident.
	
	
	On the morning of Saturday 19 October Mr Kelly received his usual care and assistance. At about 2.40pm he was seen fussing about with some of his belongings at the foot of his bed but this did not raise any alarm. At about 3.15pm he was sleeping in the chair in his room, which was said to be normal. He was woken for a sip of thickened drink and he then went back to sleep.
	
	
	At about 4.30pm Mr Kelly was observed to be in a very deep sleep and attempts were made to wake him, but he was ultimately left alone. Around 5.30pm further unsuccessful attempts were made to wake him. He was now in a state that caused concern and the registered nurse was approached. He was hypoglycaemic and hypothermic at this time. He was taken to hospital as a result, where he remained until he passed away on 29 October 2013. An autopsy revealed the direct cause of death was ""aspiration pneumonia"" with the antecedent cause, ""insulin overdose"".
	


The offender as the perpetrator


	
	The basis upon which it was proved beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was the person who administered the injections can be found within my reasons for verdict.
	
	
	There were many strands in the cable of the circumstantial Crown case. The offender was working in the Mountview ward when each of the injections was given to the three victims and he was a person who had access to insulin stored in the ward treatment room. Although security to that room was imperfect, the offender could, and was in fact required to, readily and regularly access the room. It was normally kept locked but he had a key.
	
	
	The offender possessed the necessary training, skill and experience in the administration of insulin, having done so in the course of his employment. He had in fact injected insulin to two insulin-dependent residents in the Mountview ward on 17 and 18 October, despite it being SummitCare policy that only a registered nurse should do so.
	
	
	The offender had worked at SummitCare for a little over two years. He had access to the victims and thus the opportunity to give the injections, as his job required him to administer oral medications to all residents in the Mountview ward. The nature of that position as ""primary medication giver"" also meant that he had a relationship with the victims such that they would be less likely to object to him giving them an injection than anyone else aside from a registered nurse.
	
	
	A police search of the offender's home located a number of syringes and needles as well as literature concerning insulin. That literature contained information concerning a number of types of insulin that were on hand in the Mountview treatment room at the relevant time. It also included a description of overdosing causing hypoglycaemic effects that could result in death.
	
	
	Text messages the offender sent suggested foreknowledge of the impending or prospective demise of Ms Manuel and Mr Kelly.
	
	
	In reaching the verdicts of guilty, all other potential perpetrators were eliminated. This was the result of an extensive police investigation, including the examination of CCTV footage covering every point of entry to the facility. I indicated in my reasons for the verdicts that I was satisfied beyond reasonable that the Crown had eliminated any possibility that there were multiple perpetrators or that the perpetrator was a resident, a visitor, another staff member, a woman, an unidentified person who entered without being captured on CCTV, or someone else.
	
	
	The combined force of these circumstances left me with no doubt that the offender committed the offences for which he was indicted.
	


Seriousness of the offences


	
	Three features are of particular significance in the assessment of the gravity of these offences: the vulnerability of the victims; the extreme breach of trust by the offender; and, of course, the tragic and extreme consequences of his conduct.
	
	
	The victims were of advanced age and they were in the SummitCare facility for reasons relating to their frailty and inability to care for themselves. As the Crown Prosecutor described it, they were ""compromised, disempowered and vulnerable"". Great trust was thereby placed in those charged with the responsibility of attending to their daily needs; particularly the more senior members of staff. As a Team Leader, the offender was second in charge in his ward under the registered nurse. To act in the way I have found the offender did in relation to each of these three patients was a gross violation of his position of trust.
	
	
	The offender's position of trust transcended that which he owed to his patients. A substantial degree of trust was placed in him and the other carers for residents at SummitCare by families and friends. They were entitled to expect that their loved ones would be treated with dignity and respect; as people who had lives of value.
	
	
	The offences cannot be characterised as spontaneous. Clearly there was some time, thought and preparation involved. Just how much forethought is impossible to determine, however, because it remains a complete mystery why the offender carried out these terrible crimes. Why he chose these particular victims among the various residents of the Mountview ward is also a mystery. He later told police that they were ""not problem residents""; they were ""perfect residents""; ""easy to look after""; and ""they weren't really a bother"".
	
	
	The deaths of Ms Fowler and Mr Kelly are elements of the two offences of murder. The attempted murder of Ms Manuel had consequences going beyond the elements of the offence. Although she survived and ultimately died of unrelated causes, her recovery was slow and she had a reduced level of functioning because of what the offender did to her.
	
	
	The Crown Prosecutor submitted that the offender's actions in killing Ms Fowler could inform the assessment of the seriousness of the killing of Mr Kelly and the attempted killing of Ms Manuel the following day. As I understood the submission, it was that he had seen the ""success"" of what he had done to Ms Fowler and that he had not attracted any suspicion and in this way was emboldened to go on to do what he did to the others. That may very well be so but where the offender acted in each case with an intention of causing death I do not think this adds much, if at all, to the assessment.
	
	
	In killing two and attempting to kill another vulnerable patient of an aged care facility the offender acted with extreme callousness. It is as if he thought their lives were worthless. With no specific motive being known there is some force in the Crown's submission that the offender's actions were carried out simply for the sake of killing. I am not satisfied of that beyond reasonable doubt; but I am satisfied that there is no explanation that would reduce the very grave seriousness of these crimes. Although I am not satisfied that they are in the worst case category, they are well above the midrange of offending for these types of crimes.
	
	
	I have seriously considered the Crown's submissions that the criteria for imposing a life sentence in this case are established. In the end, however, I am not satisfied that they are, even though the multiplicity of offending is a particularly significant matter in this respect. It was conceded on behalf of the offender that a ""very lengthy sentence"" that would see his release when he is of ""very advanced years"" must be imposed nonetheless.
	


Victim impact statements


	
	Family victim impact statements were provided by Ms Julie Ross and Ms Gail Russ, daughters of Ms Fowler, and by Ms Beverley Hogue, daughter of Ms Manuel. They are very moving documents to read and they have been written in a very brave and dignified manner. As one would expect, the loss of their loved ones has had very significant impacts upon them. I am also mindful of the fact that this would also be the case for all of the family members of each of Ms Fowler, Ms Manuel and Mr Kelly. Again, I extend my sincerest sympathy to them all.
	


Personal circumstances of the offender


	
	The offender did not give evidence in the trial and he has once again exercised his right to silence in the sentence proceedings. Tendered on his behalf, however, was a report of Dr Olav Nielssen, psychiatrist, dated 11 November 2016. Dr Nielssen took a history and made an assessment of the offender in an audio-visual link interview.
	
	
	The offender was born in 1987 and so he was aged 26 at the time of the offences. He has lived in the Newcastle area for most of his life. He was an only child in his parents' relationship but gained some half-siblings after his parents separated when he was aged three or four. He said he was subjected to severe physical punishments by his mother and her new partner and that is why he went to live with his grandparents at age thirteen. His father died at about that time. I interpolate that it was submitted that the offender's upbringing was one of deprivation which should mitigate his sentence because his moral culpability is less than that of an offender whose formative years have not been marred in such a way. With respect, I do not accept that submission.
	
	
	The offender applied to study nursing at university after completing high school but switched to a TAFE course. Ultimately he completed traineeships and attained certificates in aged care and then, subsequent to the offending and before being charged, completed a Diploma of Nursing and became an endorsed enrolled nurse.
	
	
	He told Dr Nielssen that he had been employed as an aged care nurse since 2006 in four different facilities in the Newcastle area and one on the Central Coast. When he was aged around 20 or 21 he was picked on at the aged care facility at which he was working and he took to self-harming by cutting or starving himself. However, he told the doctor that he ""woke up to that"" and was fine until he relapsed at some stage during the police investigation of the current matter.
	
	
	There is no history of physical ill-health and no alcohol or substance abuse issues.
	
	
	The offender said that he had seen a psychiatrist and a psychologist since coming to gaol. He has been prescribed antidepressant medication.
	
	
	The offender had no previous convictions at the time of the offences. However on 4 December 2014 he was convicted at the Newcastle Local Court for three offences of possessing a prescribed restricted substance and four offences of stealing. He was placed on a good behaviour bond for a period of 3 years.
	
	
	Those offences were said to have taken place on 5 December 2013, and between 17 July 2006 and 5 December 2013, respectively. The property the subject of each of the charges was found when police carried out a search of the offender's home on 5 December 2013. There were various medications which he admitted he had stolen during his employment at aged care facilities. Most of the medications were of a type only available by prescription. Police also found what is described as ""a vast amount of new and unused medical equipment routinely used in the aged care environment"".
	
	
	The offender told police that he stole these things during his employment at the Cranebrook Care ""William Cape Gardens"" facility at Kanwal. Police were unable to confirm this was true and so they framed the charges to allow for the thefts to have occurred at other facilities as well. They also alleged that the offender's explanation that he stole the items because of personal need was false.
	
	
	The offender described to Dr Nielssen being in a ""fine"" and ""happy"" state of mind in October 2013 (when the offences were committed). He denied being depressed or anxious or feeling in any way angry or frustrated by his work or the people under his care.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen made the diagnosis of ""Depressive illness, in partial remission"". He said that the offender's longer term prognosis ""would appear to be good compared to many accused in similar circumstances"". In this regard he referred to his lack of prior convictions or a substance use disorder and his training and employment history since leaving school. Somewhat ironically, the doctor concluded his report by noting that the offender's skills were likely to be very much in demand in prison because of the aging of the prison population with much of the care for elderly inmates being provided by other prisoners. I would expect the authorities might be cautious about this while the underlying cause of the offender's crimes remains unknown.
	


Other matters relevant to the assessment of sentence


	
	There is very little in the offender's personal circumstances which operate in mitigation of sentence.
	
	
	He should receive the benefit of his otherwise good character, aside from the possession and stealing offences; although in the scheme of things they pale into insignificance.
	
	
	It was submitted that the offender should receive credit for facilitating the administration of justice by limiting the facts in issue in the trial. There was the potential for the Crown having to call up to 319 witnesses (in fact I was told at the start of the trial there were potentially 370 witnesses) with such a trial being estimated to take 6 weeks or more. With co-operation, the need to do so and the length of the trial were significantly reduced. I have taken this into account.
	
	
	The offender maintains his innocence and it has not been suggested that I should find he is remorseful.
	
	
	Dr Nielssen wrote in positive terms about the offender's prospects of rehabilitation. It is not apparent that he took into account that there is a complete void when it comes to understanding why the offender did what he did. It is worrying that this remains a mystery. In these circumstances I am unable to find that he is unlikely to reoffend, or that he has good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	There is a need for a strong element of general deterrence in sentencing in this case. Any mistreatment of elderly people in our community is not to be tolerated. This is particularly the case in aged care facilities which are usually not places in which people choose to live but do so out of necessity because of physical and/or cognitive frailties. Nurses and carers who misplace the trust in them to provide dignified and respectful care for elderly patients by committing gross criminal acts should know that they will be held accountable and will be met with heavy punishment.
	
	
	Recognition of the harm done to the victim of the crime and to the community is another purpose of sentencing. In this case, the former is obvious but the latter has a number of dimensions. It includes the tendency of the offender's crimes to damage the faith and trust the community places in aged care facilities to care for the ever increasing number of its vulnerable and frail elderly members.
	
	
	The offender has been in custody since his arrest on 17 December 2014 and so his sentence should be backdated to that time.
	
	
	As the offender is convicted of a ""serious violence offence"" it is a requirement that he be warned of the existence of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW). At my request, the applicant's solicitor will do so.
	
	
	Having regard to the length of the sentence I will impose I must reject the submission that the parole component should be enlarged to assist the offender's reintegration into the community. The parole period that will be allowed by imposing a sentence in the usual proportions will be more than adequate for that purpose.
	


Indicative sentences for each offence


	
	I propose to impose an aggregate sentence. That means I must indicate the sentences I otherwise would have imposed for each offence. It does not mean that I then add them up and that becomes the aggregate sentence. Sentencing principles require me to consider the overall criminality of the offender's crimes and impose what I believe is a just response.
	
	
	For each of the murders of Ms Gwendolyne Fowler and Mr Ryan Kelly, I would have imposed sentences of 30 years with a non-parole period of 22½ years.
	
	
	For the attempted murder of Ms Audrey Manuel I would have imposed a sentence of 16 years with a non-parole period of 12 years.
	


Sentence


	
	Convicted.
	
	
	Sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment of 40 years with a non-parole period of 30 years. The sentence will date from 17 December 2014. The non-parole period will expire on 16 December 2044 at which time the offender will become eligible for release on parole. The total term will expire on 16 December 2054.

 V K Rajah JA (delivering the grounds of decision of the court):
Introduction
1       Shortly after we delivered judgment in 
Muhammad bin Kadar and another v Public Prosecutor
 
[2011] SGCA 32
 (“
Kadar
”), the Prosecution requested (by way of a letter dated 8 July 2011) the temporary suspension, for six months, of the operation of [99]–[121] of 
Kadar
 (“the relevant passage”) which concerned our findings on a common law criminal disclosure regime for unused material in the hands of the Prosecution. The stated reason was to allow the Attorney-General more time to study the full impact of 
Kadar
 for the purposes of advising the government whether to legislatively amend its effect or to change the operating procedures of the Prosecution and police. We directed that the Prosecution file and serve a Criminal Motion for us to formally hear and decide on the issues raised in open court. Pursuant to this direction, the Prosecution filed Criminal Motion No 57 of 2011 (CM 57/2011). This motion contained two prayers: the first was for the court to clarify the scope of the Prosecution’s duty to disclose unused material as set out at the relevant passage of 
Kadar
 in the manner set out in an affidavit filed with the motion. The second was for the six-month suspension of the relevant passage with effect from the date of our judgment in 
Kadar
.
2       On 19 August 2011, we heard the Prosecution’s submissions in this matter and those of counsel for Ismil bin Kadar (the second appellant in Criminal Appeal No 8 of 2009 and the second respondent in CM 57/2011). Counsel for Muhammad bin Kadar (the first appellant in Criminal Appeal No 8 of 2009 and the first respondent in CM 57/2011) were present at the hearing but did not make submissions. In the Prosecution’s submission, the relevant passage was capable of two interpretations: the broader interpretation suggested that the Prosecution’s duty of disclosure includes a duty to review 
all material
 gathered by the police and law enforcement agencies in the course of investigations and evaluate that material for the purposes of disclosure. The narrower interpretation suggested that the Prosecution is only under a duty to disclose material that the prosecutor is 
actually aware of
 without the additional duty to review all material gathered in investigations. The Prosecution also indicated that it would not proceed with the second prayer if the narrow interpretation was confirmed.
3       At the conclusion of the hearing we expressed our views on the issues raised and informed counsel that we would elaborate on these in writing. We now issue these supplemental grounds to explain our reasons for giving the clarifications sought by the Prosecution as well as to restate the matters clarified.
Inherent jurisdiction and power of this court to clarify its own previous judgments
4       The Prosecution’s first prayer was for a clarification of a previous judgment of this court. We therefore had to consider at the outset whether we had the jurisdiction to hear such an application and make the requested clarification, a question that this court had not answered before. Although no directly relevant authorities could be found, all counsel accepted that the Court of Appeal had an inherent jurisdiction and power to clarify its own previous judgments.
5       A judgment, once given in criminal proceedings, cannot be 
altered
 save as provided for in s 301 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Act 15 of 2010) (“CPC 2010”). This section provides for the rectification of clerical errors at any time and of other errors by the next working day after delivery of the judgment. But it does not follow from this that the court is immediately 
functus officio
 after it has given its judgment. There remain a few circumstances where a court may either revisit its prior decision or clarify certain aspects of it. As the issue of clarification has not been provided for in the CPC 2010, we believed that s 6 of the CPC 2010 applied permitting us to adopt any procedure as the justice of the case may require that was not inconsistent with the CPC 2010 or any other law. In relation to the concept of 
functus officio
 we fully agreed with the observations of the High Court in 
Godfrey Gerald QC v UBS AG and others
 
[2004] 4 SLR(R) 411
 at [18]–[19]:
18    The Latin term 
functus officio
 is an abbreviated reference to a facet of the principle of finality in dispute resolution. 
Functus officio
 means that the office, authority or jurisdiction in question has served its purpose and is spent. A final decision, once made, cannot be revisited. In dispute resolution, this principle may manifest itself in the guise of 
res judicata
, 
functus officio
 or issue estoppel. This principle of finality is intended to embody fairness and certainty. It is not to be invoked merely as a sterile and mechanical rule in matters where there are minor oversights, inchoateness in expression and/or consequential matters that remain to be fleshed out. Given that the court is always at liberty to attend to such axiomatic issues, various judicial devices such as the “slip” rule and the implied “liberty to apply” proviso are invoked from time to time to redress or clarify such issues. 
In short, both the High Court and the Court of Appeal retain a residual inherent jurisdiction even after an order is pronounced, to clarify the terms of the order and/or to give consequential directions
.
19    That such inherent jurisdiction exists, has never been doubted. In point of fact, it is regularly invoked and exercised by the court: see O 92 r 4 of the [Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2004 Rev Ed (“RSC”)] and the helpful and incisive conspectus in Professor Jeffrey Pinsler's article “Inherent Jurisdiction Re-Visited: An Expanding Doctrine” [2002] 14 SAcLJ 1 and the commentary in 
Singapore Court Practice 2003
 at paras 1/1/7 and 1/1/8. 
This inherent jurisdiction is a virile and necessary one that a court is invested with to dispense procedural justice as a means of achieving substantive justice between parties in a matter. The power to correct or clarify an order is inherent in every court
. This power necessarily extends to ensuring that the spirit of court orders are appropriately embodied and correctly reflected to the letter. Indeed, to obviate any pettifogging arguments apropos the existence of such inherent jurisdiction, the RSC was amended in 1995 to include O 92 r 5, which expressly states:
Without prejudice to Rule 4, the Court may make or give such further orders or directions incidental or consequential to any judgment or order as may be necessary in any case.
By dint of this rule, the court has an unassailable broad discretion and jurisdiction to give effect to the intent and purport of any relief and/or remedy that may be necessary in a particular matter. Admittedly, while the rule sets out in stark terms the court's wide inherent jurisdiction in this area of procedural justice, 
I should add for completeness, that the power to “make or give such further orders or directions incidental or consequential to ...” does not
 prima facie
 extend to correcting substantive errors and/or in effecting substantive amendments or variations to orders that have been perfected
. This is plainly not such a case.
[emphasis added in bold italics]
6       While these observations were made in the context of orders made by the High Court in the exercise of its civil jurisdiction, we think the same position applies to a court, including the Court of Appeal, stating the law in the hearing of a criminal matter. This is because the inherent power of the court flows from its inherent status regardless of the subject matter of the case being heard.  To decide otherwise would be to needlessly impose the fog of ambiguity and the injustice of uncertainty on all within the legal system who have to abide by a decision that may lack clarity. It is axiomatic that the law must be made clear enough to allow all persons subject to it to order their affairs with certainty. Nothing in the CPC 2010 alters this inherent right of a court.
7       In settling on this view, we were conscious of the general dangers of releasing more than one set of grounds of decision. These include the possibilities of inconsistency, undermining of judicial credibility and 
ex post facto
 justification: see S Chandra Mohan, “Remarks, More Remarks and a Grounds of Decision: One Judgment too Many? 
T T Durai v Public Prosecutor
 Magistrate’s Appeal No 126 of 2007” 
(2009) 21 SAcLJ 591
 at para 20. Nevertheless, it also bears mention that ss 298(3), (4) and (5) of the CPC 2010 now permit a court to give supplemental reasons for its decision in certain circumstances. This, however, is not to be taken as a statutory 
carte blanche
 for the courts to engage in piecemeal justification. For these reasons, the Court of Appeal will generally only use its inherent jurisdiction to issue a clarification of a statement of law in a previous judgment where the following conditions are present:
(a)     the judgment contains a patent ambiguity;
(b)     the clarification of this ambiguity is necessary in the public interest to ensure that the judgment can be correctly implemented in practice, and then only to the extent necessary;
(c)     the application for a clarification is made within a reasonable time; and
(d)     the clarification sought is a genuine clarification and not an attempt to re-open litigation, meaning that the clarification should not affect the orders already made in the main judgment.
8       There is some interaction between requirements (a) and (b) in the sense that some judgments require a greater degree of certainty to practically implement than others. This is particularly so, in a case such as this, where a court restates the legal position on an important area of law that will have significant consequences for the administration of justice. Where this court is convinced that in a particular case there is little or no room for ambiguity, this will influence its decision as to whether requirement (a) has been met. If the court is persuaded that the public interest necessitates that a legal issue be made absolutely clear, this might be done even if there is only an apparent ambiguity. It will be noted that requirement (c) is really a corollary of requirement (b): if the application for a clarification is not made within a reasonable time, this will be compelling evidence that the clarification was not necessary for the practical implementation of the judgment.
Our decision in CM 57/2011
9       In CM 57/2011, the Prosecution was primarily concerned to clarify whether a prosecutor’s duty (which it accepted as both institutional and individual) to evaluate unused material for disclosure in criminal cases extended to calling for and scrutinising material pertaining to the case that he or she had not already been made aware of (see 
[2]
 above). This was in the light of the large amount of such material gathered by law enforcement agencies in the course of criminal investigations. Not all of this material is always made available to the Prosecution (because of its irrelevance to the charge(s) preferred or for operational reasons). In addition, the Prosecution wished to clarify whether the timeline for disclosure of unused material falling under ss 196 and 166 of the CPC 2010 would be the timelines prescribed in those sections. Counsel for the second respondent accepted that the judgment in 
Kadar
 did not impose an obligation on the Prosecution to search for material not in its possession but asserted that the duty was not confined to only the prosecutor having carriage of the trial.
10     On a strict application of the test above at 
[7]
, we did not see this as a particularly compelling case in terms of requirement (a).We did not find the Prosecution’s arguments on the purported ambiguity in the Prosecution’s duty of disclosure as outlined in 
Kadar
 particularly convincing. When queried which particular paragraphs in the Judgment had given rise to such an ambiguity the Prosecution responded that it was the broad thrust of the views expressed therein rather than any particular passage. We were also doubtful about the existence of an ambiguity necessitating the second clarification, considering that this court does not have any power to depart from the express requirements of written law such as that contained in ss 196 and 166 of the CPC 2010.
11     However, the Prosecution also submitted that the continued viability of a great deal of investigative and prosecutorial practice turned on a definitive resolution of the doubts they had raised. Specifically, if prosecutors had a duty to search through everything the investigators gathered in the course of their work, this would necessitate very substantial changes in the conduct of both investigations and prosecutions. The judgment in 
Kadar
, it appears from the Prosecution’s submissions, had far-reaching consequences because it mandated a sea change in the previously settled view of the Prosecution’s duty of disclosure (which rested on the now rejected view of the High Court in 
Selvarajan James v Public Prosecutor
 
[2000] 2 SLR(R) 946
). The Prosecution maintained that it was most anxious to ensure that it properly understood what was henceforth expected of it by the courts in the conduct of criminal proceedings. We found this particular concern more persuasive. Despite the absence of a patent ambiguity, we recognised that any reasonable misapprehension entertained about our views on the duty expressed in 
Kadar
 might lead the relevant agencies to undertake a significant overhaul of their practices even though it might not be immediately warranted. As such, we felt that this was indeed an exceptional occasion that justified the clarification requested even though the relevant passage contained (on the reading most generous to the Prosecution) only an apparent ambiguity. We also found that the other requirements stated above at 
[7]
 were met.
12     For context it would be helpful if we set out here a crucial part of what we stated in 
Kadar
 under the heading “Scope of the Prosecution’s duty of disclosure under the common law of Singapore” at [113]:
 
In our view, it is not necessary, for present purposes, for us to attempt a comprehensive statement of what the law of Singapore should be in this area. There is still ample scope for the development of the fine details in subsequent cases or by legislative intervention. It suffices for us to say that we agree with the Prosecution that the duty of disclosure certainly does not cover all unused material or even all evidence inconsistent with the Prosecution’s case
. However, the Prosecution must disclose to the Defence material which takes the form of:
(a)    any unused material that is likely to be admissible and that might reasonably be regarded as credible and relevant to the guilt or innocence of the accused; and
(b)    any unused material that is likely to be inadmissible, but would provide a real (not fanciful) chance of pursuing a line of inquiry that leads to material that is likely to be admissible and that might reasonably be regarded as credible and relevant to the guilt or innocence of the accused.
This will not include material which is neutral or adverse to the accused – it only includes material that tends to undermine the Prosecution’s case or strengthen the Defence’s case. To ensure congruence with the statutory scheme for disclosure this material should initially be disclosed no later than seven days before the date fixed for the committal hearing for High Court trials or two weeks from the CCDC for Subordinate Court trials (corresponding to the timelines in ss 176(3)(
b
) and 161(2) of the CPC 2010 respectively). Where under s 159 of the CPC 2010 the statutory criminal case disclosure procedures do not apply, the common law disclosure described here should take place at the latest before the trial begins. The obligation of disclosure (as the Prosecution has correctly acknowledged in its further submissions) is a continuing one and only ends when the case has been completely disposed of, including any appeal. Throughout this period, the Prosecution is obliged to continuously evaluate undisclosed material 
in its possession
 to see if it ought to be the subject of further disclosure.
[emphasis added in bold italics]
13     The following is clear from the entirety of the above passage. First, there was no attempt by this court in 
Kadar
 to comprehensively state the law on this issue. Second, “the duty of disclosure certainly does not cover all unused material or even all evidence inconsistent with the Prosecution’s case”. Third, our judgment in 
Kadar
 does not frame any duty in relation to the work of investigators and how they ought to interact with the Prosecution. That issue did not arise on the facts before us. Fourth, we referred to the duty imposed on the Prosecution as applying continuously to undisclosed material “in its possession”, that is to say, within its knowledge.
14     We therefore clarified that the Prosecution’s duty of disclosure as stated at [113] of 
Kadar
 certainly does not require the Prosecution to search for additional material. This view was also plainly indicated by the factual context of 
Kadar
, where the statements that were disclosed late by the Prosecution were actually unused material within the knowledge of the Prosecution (as opposed to material outside their initial knowledge that they had to search for). The Prosecution’s explanation for non-disclosure (which we rejected) was based on the credibility of the statements (see 
Kadar
 at [198]). No suggestion had been made that the Prosecution did not know about those statements at the relevant time. There was absolutely no issue for us to consider as to whether the Prosecution had failed to ascertain the existence of those statements. In addition, none of the authorities we referred to from various common law jurisdictions suggested that the Prosecution’s common law duty of disclosure extended to material outside of the Prosecution’s knowledge. 
Surely, the Prosecution cannot be expected to disclose what it does not know of?
 Where such an issue has been addressed, it has been addressed outside the scope of judge-made law: see for example the English Crown Prosecution Service Disclosure Manual <http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/d_to_g/disclosure_manual/> (accessed on 25 August 2011) at ch 2, para 2.2 (describing the duty of the investigator to inform the prosecutor as early as possible whether any material weakens the case against the accused) and ch 3 (containing detailed roles and responsibilities for investigators in relation to disclosure as set out in the relevant statutory Code of Practice). We do not know of a power under Singapore law that empowers a court to 
compel
 investigative agencies (which are executive bodies) to adopt a code of practice purely by way of judicial pronouncement.
15     We also clarified that where material falls within the scope of ss 196 or 166 of the CPC 2010, such material should be disclosed within the timelines provided for in those sections, while all other disclosable material should be provided in accordance with the timings set out in [113] of the judgment in 
Kadar
.
16     The Prosecution indicated that with such a clarification, it would no longer be pursuing an application for a temporary suspension of the relevant passage of 
Kadar
. We therefore made no order in relation to the second prayer in CM 57/2011, although we indicated to the Prosecution that we were doubtful that such an order could have been made in any case given the prevailing circumstances.
Other observations 
17     Although our actual clarification was confined to the matters set out at 
[14]
 and 
[16]
 above, we also took note of a further point mentioned in the Prosecution’s submissions. The Prosecution submitted that the disclosure obligation should be subject to public interest requirements for confidentiality, such as statutes requiring non-disclosure of certain types of information. These include s 23 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”) and s 127 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (“Evidence Act”), both of which contain regimes for non-disclosure of information relating to the commission of certain criminal offences. Also mentioned were ss 125 and 126 of the Evidence Act: these restrict the giving of evidence as to affairs of State and communications made in official confidence respectively.
18     It is a trite proposition a court does not have the power to depart from or vary the requirements of statute law. We therefore state, purely for the avoidance of doubt, that our judgment in 
Kadar
 does not affect the operation of any ground for non-disclosure recognised by any law (
eg
, the MDA or Evidence Act). The procedure for such non-disclosure will be as contemplated in the respective laws, and where the procedure requires it, the Prosecution will have to make the necessary application to the court to show that the case falls within the scope where non-disclosure applies.
19     Counsel for the second respondent was concerned that the duty of disclosure should not be limited to the particular prosecutor conducting a criminal trial (see 
[9]
 above). In the same paragraph, we noted that the Prosecution accepted that its duty of disclosure was institutional as well as personal. However, the Prosecution did express a concern that certain material might be possessed by the Public Prosecutor’s office generally (
eg
, material in the file relating to a different prosecution) without it being known to any specific prosecutor that such material was relevant and possibly disclosable in a specific case. To quote counsel for the Prosecution
[note: 1]
:
[W]hat we are trying to say is that … whatever is in the [Investigation Paper] that a prosecutor should know, so insofar as whatever information is in the [Investigation Paper], in that sense, the prosecution as a whole should know what’s in the [Investigation Paper]. Our concern was with situations where there’s a need to connect the dots to other information beyond the prosecutor and for example, other [Investigation Papers] in other cases or in the investigation agencies or some other information within the government. We were … concerned about that. Because as an institution, we are fairly large now and we were concerned that there might be linkages that we were expected to follow up on. That was our primary concern, your Honour. So, in that sense, if the prosecution is equated with whoever touches the [Investigation Paper] and is involved in that case, we---we, your Honour, would say that those persons are all under an obligation.
20     For the sake of clarity, we observe that if a prosecutor cannot be expected to disclose material that he 
does not know of
 in a 
known case
 (see 
[15]
 above), he also cannot be expected to disclose material if he 
does not know
 of a 
case
 where it should be disclosed. However, if a prosecutor knows of material 
and
 knows of a case where it should be disclosed, he is under a duty to arrange for the disclosure of that material even if he is not directly assigned to conduct that case. This is included in the Prosecution’s institutional duty of disclosure, which at its most basic level is a duty to comply with the spirit of the Prosecution’s disclosure obligation rather than the mere letter. We are heartened that the Prosecution seems willing to fulfil this institutional duty.
21     We would emphasise that the primary purpose of the disclosure obligation set out in 
Kadar
 is not to embarrass or inconvenience the Prosecution: it is to ensure a fair trial and that miscarriages of justice are avoided (see [86] and [98] of 
Kadar
). We would draw attention to [120] of 
Kadar
, where it was emphasised that “not all non-disclosures will be attributable to fault on the part of the Prosecution (or a lack of 
bona fides
)”. We then elaborated that such inadvertent non-disclosures might nevertheless lead to a conviction being unsafe. With this in mind, we would like to see the Prosecution proactively making continuous disclosure of material that was inadvertently not disclosed at an earlier stage of proceedings without undue fear of criticism. This would be in line with the spirit of the disclosure obligation. If the Public Prosecutor deems it appropriate, measures could be taken to minimise the risk of such inadvertent non-disclosure (
eg
 better sharing of knowledge among prosecutors working on different cases involving related matters or parties).
Conclusion
22     For the reasons stated we have clarified the scope of the Prosecution’s duty of disclosure as stated in our judgment in 
Kadar
 and made no order in relation to the second prayer in CM 57/2011.

Transcript dated 19 August 2011, p 19, lines 10–26",2011-08-26 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal
3857774,R v Xie (No 11) [2015] NSWSC 2123,"Judgment


	
	HER HONOUR: On 18 January 2010, a warrant issued under the Surveillance Devices Act 2007 (NSW) entitling police to install audio and video recording devices in the accused’s home at Beck Street, Epping. The visual surveillance device was continuously monitored from 8 February 2010 until 10 May 2010 when it was discovered by the accused and deactivated. The audio surveillance device in the accused’s bedroom continued in operation until some later date.
	
	
	The accused and his wife, Kathy Lin, were interviewed by police at various intervals during the period both surveillance devices were operative in the expectation that they would discuss the questions asked of them, and that in their conversations they would reveal more of the events of 17 and 18 July 2009 than what they had initially disclosed to police.
	
	
	On 27 April 2010, Kathy Lin was also summonsed to appear at the New South Wales Crime Commission (“the NSWCC”). On 3 May 2010 she appeared and was questioned under compulsion. In the course of her examination she was told, in effect, that the police believed that her husband was the murderer as the shoe print impressions in blood at Boundary Road corresponded with the style and size of sports shoes he was known to wear. That was also done in the expectation that she would reveal this information to the accused.
	
	
	The Crown tendered a large volume of material derived from the operation of the surveillance devices. Objection was taken to the evidence in its entirety save for the audiovisual recording of the accused and his wife on 6 May 2010 where the accused is shown destroying shoe boxes in his wife’s presence. It was submitted by the accused that the balance of the evidence gathered by the use of the surveillance devices was irrelevant to any fact in issue and therefore not admissible as provided for in s 56(2) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) or, if any were admissible, they should be excluded under ss 135 and 137.
	
	
	It was conceded by defence counsel that the accused’s conduct in destroying the shoe boxes was probative of his guilt. Although the video surveillance device had an accompanying soundtrack, and although the accused and his wife were heard speaking as the boxes were being destroyed, little, if anything, was able to be discerned of what they said. In the result, the Crown relied on the audio record for the limited purpose of evidencing the ambient sounds associated with the destruction of the boxes.
	
	
	The balance of the material derived from the operation of the surveillance devices was in the form of select excerpts from the monitored conversations of the accused and his wife over many months. The surveillance device transcripts relate to eight days, namely the 16 March, 19 March, 20 March, 22 March, 30 March, 6 April, 29 April and 6 May, each of 16 March and 22 March being days when the accused and his wife were interviewed by police. These conversations were translated from Cantonese or Mandarin into English and produced for tender in the form of written transcripts. The transcripts are said by the Crown to contain a number of implied admissions by the accused and thus probative of his guilt. Some parts of the transcripts also record Brenda Lin speaking, and being spoken to by the accused, in a way that is also said by the Crown to be probative of the accused’s guilt.
	
	
	Before hearing argument on the question of admissibility, I undertook a close reading of the transcribed conversations. It was the agreed position of the parties that, if the surveillance device transcripts were admitted, I would read the evidence to the jury.
	
	
	It was common ground that the variable quality of the audio record produced by the surveillance devices was such that close consideration and revision of what could be heard, by a number of interpreters, was required before the final version of the transcripts relied upon by the Crown for tender purposes was served during the course of the trial. In its final form, on each of the 170 pages comprising the tender, there are repeated notations by the interpreters that words or phrases are either indistinct (noted on the transcript as [IND]), sentences in whole or in part incomplete (noted on the transcript as [Incomplete] or […]) or notations indicating overtalk (also noted on the transcript as […]).
	
	
	In addition, it appears that the accused and his wife use a Mandarin or Cantonese idiom and phrasing when speaking to one another, which, together with the grammatical construction and syntax particular to both languages, required close consideration and some interpretation to render meaningful in English what was said. In some passages, despite repeated reading and the need for me to make some assumptions as to what is being spoken about, the meaning remained either obscure or wholly impressionistic.
	
	
	The Crown maintains the submission that despite those limitations, it is possible to discern sufficient of what is being said by the accused for the surveillance device transcripts to be admitted in their entirety as probative of his guilt.
	
	
	No application was made by the Crown during the course of argument for an edited form of any of the transcripts to be tendered in substitution for the material. The challenge by the accused to the admissibility of the surveillance device transcripts in their entirety, does not obligate me to undertake any editing exercise, assuming that might be able to be done, there being no submission by the Crown that a narrower reading of parts only of the transcripts on individual days (whether read separately or as a whole) satisfied the test for admissibility under s 56 and/or that a limited tender met the accused’s challenge to the exclusion of the evidence under the discretions in Pt 3.11 of the Evidence Act
	
	
	Initially, the Crown did not address the probative value of what are said to be implied admissions by the accused in the tendered material, in the context of what he said to police in the initial phase of the investigation on various dates in July 2009 or upon being further interviewed on 16 March 2010. At my request, the Crown did provide me with a transcript of the interview of the accused on 22 March 2010, which was conducted while the surveillance devices were in operation.
	


Interviews in 2009


	
	The accused and his wife were initially interviewed at length within days of the murders. The accused was not a suspect at that time. In the course of those interviews both the accused and his wife accounted for their movements on 17 and 18 July 2009. They said they were both at 55A Boundary Road on the late evening of 17 July 2009 after driving the deceased children home from a family dinner. It is the Crown case that the other three deceased were asleep inside the house at that time. They also both told police that, after leaving Boundary Road, they drove the short distance to their home in Beck Street where they remained until the following morning. They both said they slept together that night. They told police that they rose separately the following morning and that at some time before 9am, they left home to take their son out for breakfast, stopping at Boundary Road en route to see why the deceased Min Lin had not opened the newsagency. They also gave an account of finding Lily Lin, Irene Lin, Terry Lin and Henry Lin deceased inside the house and notifying police. Police located Min Lin concealed beneath bedclothes next to his deceased wife, Lily Lin, later that afternoon.
	
	
	It is the Crown case that the accused lied to police when he said that he was with his wife and son throughout the late evening of 17 July and early morning of 18 July, and that he did so in the knowledge that his wife would not be able to contradict his alibi, having told a prison informer that his wife was at no risk of revealing that he had left the house as she was sedated. That person, referred to in the trial as Witness A, is also to give other evidence of conversations with the accused probative of his guilt.
	
	
	When interviewed by police on 22 March 2010 and again to the NSWCC in September 2011 (apparently after Witness A provided the information to police), Kathy Lin denied using sleeping tablets. It is unclear whether the Crown will assert that the accused sedated his wife without her knowledge or that Kathy Lin should not be believed when she denies using sleeping tablets.
	
	
	Although I am unaware of the content of the affidavit sworn in support of the issue of the surveillance device warrant, it must be that the police did not believe that Kathy Lin was in fact able to account for her husband’s presence throughout the evening of 17 July and through to the early morning of 18 July, although it would appear that the police did not at that time have any evidence that that was because she was sedated, even if they might have had suspicions that was the case.
	
	
	The circumstances in which Kathy Lin discovered the body of the deceased Lily Lin are also in issue in the trial. It is the Crown case that the accused attempted to shield his wife from seeing Lily Lin’s body at a time when he could not have seen the deceased’s bloodied and battered head and face on the bed or the blood on the surrounding walls. The Crown submits that this conduct evidences a consciousness of guilt since the accused could only have known that Lily Lin’s badly beaten and bloodied body was uncovered on the bed because that was how he left her after killing her.
	
	
	The accused’s conduct in leaving his wife at Boundary Road before police arrived is also a matter of controversy and also said to reveal consciousness of guilt. It is the Crown case that he left his wife at the house despite her protestations having just discovered the bodies of four family members, as he knew that she was at no risk of her brother (the deceased Min Lin) being the killer, or another killer being in the area, because he knew that he had killed Min Lin, as he had the four other deceased, and that he had left Min Lin’s body concealed under bedclothes.
	
	
	Between July 2009 and February 2010, as the murder investigation was progressing, the police had gathering suspicions that the accused was the murderer. These suspicions culminated in the application for the issue of the surveillance device warrant. Kathy Lin was not a suspect at that time, or at any time thereafter. The Crown will not allege at the trial that she wilfully provided police with false information when she was interviewed in the immediate aftermath of the murders. To the contrary. To the extent that she gives evidence inconsistent with what she told police at that time about the circumstances in which Lily Lin’s body was discovered and the fact that she was unaware that her brother was also in the bed, the Crown has foreshadowed an application for leave to cross-examine her under s 38 of the Evidence Act.
	


Interviews in 2010


	
	Once the surveillance devices were installed in Beck Street and operating, a series of interviews were conducted, first with the accused on 16 March 2010 and then with his wife on 22 March 2010. The questions asked by police in both interviews were no doubt designed to have the accused and his wife reiterate, and perhaps elaborate on their movements on 17 and 18 July, amongst other issues, when they returned home.
	
	
	On 2 March 2010, police met with Kathy Lin by pre-arrangement. Police then accompanied her to Eastwood Police Station where they had what has been described in the evidence as an “informal conversation”, which I take to mean the conversation was not the subject of a formal interview and was not electronically recorded. In the course of that conversation, Detective Maree, the officer in charge, told Kathy Lin that it was the experience of investigators that in murders involving family members, a member of the family or someone close to the family is often involved. She responded to the implied suggestion that the accused might be responsible by rejecting that as a possibility. She said, “It’s impossible, no reason he love me, love children, parents and brothers family, maybe you thought he stay at home, nothing to do”.
	
	
	On 5 March 2010, police contacted the accused and asked whether he would be available to be interviewed by police. On 16 March 2010 he met with police by pre-arrangement and was taken to Ryde Police Station. He was not accompanied by a solicitor. He was introduced to the custody manager and placed in the dock but was not under arrest. He was electronically recorded in an interview from 11.53am until 2.38pm. He was cautioned in conventional terms and agreed to participate in the interview voluntarily.
	
	
	Relevantly for the purposes of this application, the accused was asked by police again to account for his movements after dropping the deceased children at Boundary Road on the evening of 17 July 2009 (see questions 125-176).
	
	
	He said he could not recall many things in detail and referred police to his earlier lengthy interviews on 20, 21 and 22 July 2009. (I was not provided with copies of those interviews for the purposes of this application.) He did say, however, he was sure that he did not go to bed immediately on arriving home but spent time with his wife watching television or utilising the internet. When asked what time he went to bed, he said he could not remember the exact time but thought it was after midnight. When asked for more precision as to when he went to bed, he was unable to provide it. He said he “normally” went to bed at the same time as his wife but that he could not remember whether he followed that “normal” course on that night. He said, once in bed, he could not say for certain whether he went straight to sleep.
	
	
	He was also questioned about a range of other matters, including the circumstances in which he and his wife first discovered the deceased Lily Lin. He was questioned in some detail about who entered the bedroom first, where he stood relative to his wife, who saw what first and their reaction to what they saw (see questions 332-379). He also told police that, in effect, it was a joint decision that his wife stay at Boundary Road and wait for the ambulance whilst he went to collect his parents-in-law from Merrylands. He confirmed that he had a spare key to Boundary Road, which was normally kept at Beck Street but sometimes in his wife’s car (see questions 804-808).
	


12 March 2010


	
	An excerpt of the conversation between the accused and his wife on 12 March 2010, four days before the accused was interviewed and ten days after the informal discussions the police had with Kathy Lin, was the first of ten extracts the subject of the Crown tender. The Crown identified the relevance of this excerpt as bearing on the circumstances in which Kathy Lin stayed at Boundary Road whilst the accused went to collect her parents. Although the accused repeated to his wife what he had told police (to the effect that they had both agreed that he should go and she should stay), his wife countered by saying that was not her position initially, reminding him that she had said, “You stay with me. Don’t go. I don’t want you to go. I am scared”. The accused did not respond to that assertion in any way capable of being construed as suggesting to her that she should not repeat that to police or that to do so would be to expose him in some adverse way.
	
	
	Although in this same extract the accused discussed with his wife the claim by his parents-in-law that he raised the issue of the guardianship with them at Boundary Road, he referred only to their claim that it was said whilst they were in the ambulance as “a lie”. The Crown case is that the guardianship issue was raised by the accused with his parents-in-law while they were sitting on the side of the road opposite 55A Boundary Road after the accused had collected them from their home and taken them to Boundary Road.
	
	
	In the course of argument, the Crown conceded that there was nothing in what the accused said in the extract of 12 March 2010 which amounted to an express or implied admission (being a statement against interest or an implied statement against interest) or anything he said of sufficient clarity to justify the admission of the evidence on that basis. The Crown did indicate, however, its intention to utilise the transcript as part of the foreshadowed application for leave under s 38 of the Evidence Act to cross-examine Kathy Lin when she is called as a Crown witness. As I indicated to both counsel in the course of argument, that question would be reserved until such time as the application was made and submissions were directed to the Crown’s entitlement to use the transcript for that purpose.
	


16 March 2010


	
	The next excerpt in the body of the surveillance device transcripts tendered by the Crown records a conversation between the accused and his wife on 16 March 2010. That transcript runs to six pages.
	
	
	There can be no doubt that the accused is aware from what he says to his wife that he believes he is now suspected of killing the deceased. He openly discusses with his wife the need to prove (to police) that he was at home with her at the time of the murders. He also makes express reference to what, it must be assumed, his wife told him after police spoke to her on 2 March 2010, to the effect that the police considered that murders of this kind were usually committed by family members. The following excerpt makes this clear :
	


R: Initially I didn’t mind what the police said: for all the murder … (Ind) in Australia the leading reason was money. And I agreed to it. Recently they are gradually changing their point of view and saying no, … (Ind), Saying these crimes were usually committed by family members….Anyway, this is point of view they have come to now. So from what was said today, I could sense … (Ind) that meaning, uh: besides, besides money there are still some other unimaginable motives. There are even such things.


	
	They then discuss their shared belief that Kathy Lin’s parents are the source of the renewed police interest in the accused as a suspect. They both speak in this extracted conversation, as in many others the subject of the Crown tender, in very critical and sometimes hateful terms about her parents for that reason. In most exchanges on this subject, Kathy Lin is driving the conversation. It is well established by the evidence already led by the Crown that there was enmity between the accused and his wife on the one hand, and her parents on the other hand at this time. The Crown relied upon the family conflict, not to ground a submission to the jury that the suspicions of the accused’s parents-in-law that the accused was the murderer were well founded, but in support of what the Crown alleges to be the accused’s desire to secure control over Brenda Lin and his need to secure his wife’s cooperation in being appointed her legal guardian at the expense of her grandparents for that reason.
	
	
	The Crown did not submit that the accused’s belief that his parents-in–law had reignited the police interest in him as a suspect or his criticism of them was relevant as a discrete issue. As I see it, the mere fact that he discussed with his wife the interference of his parents-in-law is not, without more, probative of his guilt.
	
	
	The accused and his wife also speak about the police “framing” them (or him) in this excerpt, a repeated theme in other conversations the subject of the Crown tender. I take their joint use of this term (translated from either Cantonese or Mandarin) to mean a concern that the police have been wrongly inflamed by the intervention of Kathy Lin’s parents and that this has given rise to a misplaced suspicion on the part of police that the accused is the murderer, if for no other reason than they have not found the real culprit.
	
	
	What the accused says to his wife in the following excerpt on 16 March 2010 must necessarily be read in that context:
	


R: but this thing is the truth. This thing, I can say it and you can also say it. But about the other things whatever other people would say, we can do nothing. Ran into us on the road. What can you do about it? Isn’t that right?.

K: Mm.

R: Our car was seen in that place at the night time of 12 o’clock, it emerged, appeared there. For this I really can say nothing, in this case.

K: Exactly.

R: that is, if the police want to frame me up. I’m just saying.

K: Yes, stayed with you, with you that night.

R: This Absolutely . . . What else is there to say? Son, where did he sleep? I said, the two slept in the middle. What else is there to say? (Sighs)…to say?

[Emphasis added]


	
	It seems to me that the following exchange might be fairly considered to be the high watermark of what the probative value of the accused’s conversations with his wife on 16 March 2010. The extract commences at some undefined point in time on that day with the following words:
	


R: To prove it? I’m really unable to do so. I’m really unable to prove it.

K: I prove on that night I was with you.

R: I can only prove that we two stayed together. What else could be proved? I said I didn’t go out. You say that I did, and with witness. Then I can do nothing about it. You have witness, okay.

K: Mm.

R: Yes, about this I really can do nothing.

K: Mm.

R: I’m just saying. You, you can even say, Oh, on that night you were seen walk out at 11, 12 o’clock. You, you were seen by two people.” [sic] I really can do nothing about it if the witnesses are found. It’s only that, I can only, (Laughs) I can only say that we two stayed together. As for other (things), I really can say nothing. Do you understand what I mean?

K: I know.

R: The bottom line is this. Anything else, I cannot control.

K: … (Ind), if I was not staying with you, who was I staying with, then? (Laughs).


	
	The accused repeated, on a number of occasions, that their joint account to police of sleeping together throughout the night/early morning of 17/18 July was the “bottom line” and the only possibility of that being contradicted would be if people (presumably some putative eyewitness) made “false testimony”. In that context the accused said as follows:
	


R: I have already said, this is where the bottom line is. No need to say anything else. That is, get, get to the bottom line, this is the bottom line.

K: Mm.

R: As to what you said, I, I, I, I uh hire, spent money to hire a killer. You prove it, you prove it. I am unable to prove it. Just saying. You, you should find the proof to prove what I did. Who were hired, how much money were paid, how to pay. You find out the proof. I, I’m unable to prove it. I, I didn’t . . . You say I did it. What can I do? I say I didn’t, and the only thing I can say is I didn’t. Just saying. That is, I didn’t do it myself, and neither did I hire, uh, spent money to hire someone to do it. I can only say … (Ind).


	
	In another passage, he said:
	


R: What happened then was we two stayed together. You can say whatever you like. Where saw what. I really can do nothing about that.

K: Mm.

R: Even if I am beaten to death, I still won’t believe any cameras on that night ever captured our car and captured us leaving home. That is to say, at most he/she can find witness, that is, there’s someone saying something. Can only do that.

(The Crown was unable to attribute any meaning to the accused’s reference to the accused and his wife leaving by car or a reference later to cameras at a railway station.)


	
	The fact that the accused and his wife are discussing their movements upon arriving at their home on the night of 17 July through to the following morning, in light of what they genuinely and, as it happens, correctly believe to be the police suspicion that the accused is the murderer, cannot, of itself, rationally affect the jury’s assessment of whether he is the murderer. The fact that they are discussing their movements is unsurprising given the renewed police interest in the accused’s movements at the time the deceased were killed and whether his wife can corroborate his account. Viewed in that way, the accused’s commentary on what his wife can say about it has no probative value at all.
	
	
	I do not find the Crown’s submission that an innocent person would not speak as the accused did about there being no eyewitnesses to him having left Beck Street in the early hours of 18 July and walking to Boundary Road, and thus the need for his alibi to be accepted, or his other references to the police case being deficient of any evidence to incriminate him (assuming that is what he is referring to when he speaks in this excerpt about the lack of “cameras” or his fear of being “framed”) as compelling.
	
	
	It is no part of the Crown case that Kathy Lin conspired with the accused to give him a false alibi, or that she colluded with him to assist him in avoiding being charged, whether because she knew that he was the killer or whether she believed or suspected he might be. Further, as I read the excerpt of conversation on 16 March (again in its entirety since the Crown presses the tender of the entire extract), there is nothing capable of being derived from their conversations as a whole which is suggestive of the accused importuning his wife to either give police a false account of his movements, or for her to give an account that she did not genuinely and independently believe was true. Further, if it be the fact that Kathy Lin was sedated as the Crown alleges (albeit that she may be unaware that she was), it might even be said that the accused had no reason to importune his wife or to direct her, or even to encourage her, to say other than what he expected she would say of her own accord, namely that, so far as she knew, he did not get out of bed through the night. The Crown did not advance the submission that the accused’s participation in the conversation with his wife about his “alibi”, and the terms in which he expressed himself, was a carefully constructed ruse designed to conceal from his wife that she was sedated by the pretence that they may either have different memories of the same events or should have the same memory of their movements.
	
	
	For those reasons, in my assessment, a fair reading of what the accused says to his wife in the extract of 16 March 2010, exemplified by the passages extracted above, does not have the capacity to rationally effect the jury’s assessment of the probability of the existence of the fact in issue as contended by the Crown, namely as evidencing steps taken by him to maintain a false alibi, with the support of his wife, to ensure he was not charged.
	


22 March 2010


	
	The next series of extracts (three in number) relate to conversations on 22 March 2010. The first extract extends over five pages, the second over four pages and the third over eight pages.
	
	
	The time differential between the three transcripts is not evident on the transcripts. It is clear, however, that each record of conversation between the accused and his wife follows an interview in which she participated with police that afternoon, during which she was represented by a solicitor.
	
	
	The fact that Kathy Lin was legally represented and the accused was not when he was interviewed on 16 March 2010 was the subject of considerable commentary in the recorded conversations on 22 March 2010 and on repeated occasions thereafter. On almost every occasion where it was discussed, Kathy Lin reprimands or chides her husband for not having had a solicitor present when he was interviewed. I am unable to see how his tacit acceptance of her criticism of him is probative of any fact in issue. I am also unable to see the relevance of the fact that Kathy Lin was legally represented during the interview, or the fact that her solicitor intervened on her behalf to advise her that she should not answer questions which focused on whether the accused got out of bed in the early hours of 18 July 2009, which advice she followed.
	
	
	In the same interview, however, Kathy Lin did answer questions about her movements, and those of the accused, on their return from Boundary Road after dropping the deceased children home some time after 10pm on 17 July 2009. As to that fact, she said she was unable to recall the time that she arrived. Although she recalled turning the television on, she was unable to recall what she watched. She said her husband used the internet, but she was unable to recall any specific internet sites that were visited. When asked what time she went to bed she said, “I can’t recall but normally it would be 2 or 3 o’clock”, being the “normal time” she went to bed. She also said the accused went to bed first but that he was not asleep when she joined him. She was unable to recall whether she fell asleep as soon as she went to bed and was unable to recall whether she woke during the night. When asked the direct question as to whether her husband got out of bed during the night, or whether it was possible he got out of bed during the night, and questions related to that issue, she either said she did not know or answered “no comment”. As I have already noted, in the extracts of conversation following that interview, Kathy Lin is critical of her husband for having gone to the police without a lawyer as contrasted with the legal protection she told him she utilised in the face of police questioning.
	
	
	Kathy Lin was also interviewed on 22 March 2010 about the circumstances in which she entered her brother’s bedroom at Boundary Road and what the accused might have seen, or could have seen, of the deceased Lily Lin in the bed before he sought to shield her from that view. She said in that interview, as she did on 20 July 2009, that he was behind her as she entered.
	
	
	In the first extract of the surveillance device transcripts of 22 March 2010 (an extract extending over five pages), the accused refers again to the fact that he had been interviewed by police about his movements upon arriving home on 17 July 2009 (presumably in the interview on 16 March). Kathy Lin also refers to having been asked similar questions that day, which she elected not to answer. In recounting to his wife what I interpret to be his answers to police when he was interviewed he said:
	


R: It was admittedly good that he/she asked me that day; but didn’t ask about whether you went out in the middle with me. Just asked just me myself. I said don’t involve me; I don’t know anything, ‘normal’. …….. Normal and quiet. Normal. ( words in English) In other words the fact is that I don’t wish to … (ind) know er the truth is I really cannot remember about that night if I was unable to fall asleep; how can that be so fantastic eh? …

K: … Hmm?

R: … They are here to trick up some …

K: … Er yes …

R: … psychology questions or perhaps use the media to sock you and meanwhile lead us along to trawl for errors you see? Well it can’t be helped; they have carefully put together a host of questions, we are just snared off guarded as all is out of a sudden …

K: … How would they know eh!? …

R: … Well ummm just answering the questions accordingly … …


	
	In the conversation that immediately followed, the accused and his wife appear (again on what I consider to be a fair reading of what is said) to discuss the fact that she would not know, just as he would not know, whether the other got out of bed during the course of the night, at which point the accused expresses his concern, that being the case, that his wife will be unable “to provide prove for me when the time comes”:
	


K: … How would we know eh!? Just like for instance eh he is sleeping with his wife; his wife … his wife gets up half way through the night, and would he know that eh!? Won’t necessarily definitely know for certain eh…

R: … Yeah right …

K: … His wife walks to the front door; goes for a walk around and came back again! Would that be noticed!?

R: … That’s what it is …

K: … Which devil knows!? …

R: … Now that you’re enlightened with this eh; so if I had walked out there alright? You wouldn’t know either. There you are you’ve just said it eh …

K: … Aha …

R: … That is what I am most frightened of.

K: … Yes …

R: … You will be unable to provide prove for me when the time comes.


	
	Having elected, on legal advice, not to answer questions directed to her capacity to know whether the accused left the home, she says:
	


K: So that’s why he/she er what you all er that’s why Lawyer Lo said: “You don’t answer, you can refuse to answer.” So I did not answer. The main thing is that whether you took a walk outside. How would I have known eh; things like er am I sure of that or not sure. And so I will not answer. A trick. It is a trick eh … (Kathy starts to speak rapidly.) … Just like when he/she said, “Do you know that in Australia cases like this were usually done by family … family members or done by people who are associated with the family.” At the time I was already unravelled, didn’t want to talk about others/other things. What else … … And so when he/she continued to mention about my things and then I said, “What? Are you talking about  Robert eh?” (Ind) that they er (ind) and mentioned Robert again. He/she said, “I have no mentioned Robert’s name.” This is brought out by you.


	
	The accused is heard to giggle but otherwise makes no response.
	
	
	Plainly enough, what Kathy Lin says about the wisdom, as she sees it, in electing not to answer police questions cannot be evidence against the accused, unless there is some evidence, or an inference capable of being drawn from the evidence, that the accused suggested, cajoled, entreated or manipulated her into taking that position, concerned that she might say something to expose him as having the opportunity to leave the house and murder the deceased. There is nothing in any of the surveillance device transcripts that suggests that the accused conducted himself in that way, and no submissions were advanced by the Crown that he did. In fact, there is nothing, in the evidence led at trial thus far, so far as I understand it, to suggest otherwise than that Kathy Lin took it upon herself to attend on police on 22 March in the company of a lawyer and that she accepted the lawyer’s advice that she not answer some questions about her husband’s movements on the night and early morning of 17/18 July 2009. I am unaware as to whether the Crown intends to question Kathy Lin as to why she took a lawyer with her to the police interview on 22 March or whether she discussed this with the accused beforehand. Whatever the Crown may seek to do with the position that Kathy Lin took in the interview, and any relaxing of her position in the evidence she gave at the committal under cross-examination or in her evidence at trial (if there be any), I do not read the extracts of her commentary on the value or virtue of the position she took, relative to the position the accused took, as admissible against the accused.
	
	
	In the first extract of 22 March 2010, there is, however, an exchange between the accused and his wife, which, if interpreted literally, might suggest collusion between them to ensure that no “admissions” were made (to police), or “the wrong thing being said” or, as the Crown submitted, that he is seeking confirmation from his wife that she will confirm he was with her at the time of the murders. The difficulty the Crown faces in relying upon this exchange for that reason is that it is no part of the Crown case that the accused and his wife were in fact colluding in the sense of joining together to falsely account for his movements. Were that the Crown case (and it is not) the conversation may have been probative of that fact.
	
	
	The Crown did not draw any particular attention to the following passage (extracted below), and did not address any submissions as to how the Crown might seek to use it in some other way probative of guilt. I extract it to exemplify that the Crown sought the tender of all of the surveillance device transcripts without any discrimination as to any part, or parts of them, being probative of guilt whilst others, despite a literal reading of what is being said, not being sufficiently probative of guilt to justify admission:
	


K: Just like you said…

R: What ?

K: We both said the wrong thing…

R: Yes, must have said the wrong thing.

… (Beeping sound)

K: Yes correct (ind) whatever is said (ind) to say it poorly (ind) to frame you…

…

R: But there is no hard evidence.

K: I know, but …

R: … Relying on verbal statements alone are insufficient. Unless we have admitted otherwise, relying on the statement itself is insufficient. Unless we admit that oh er we have done all the things at the scene and this and that. Then that would be fine. Otherwise you’ll need to have evidence.


	
	In the second excerpt of the recorded conversations of the accused and his wife on 22 March 2010, they speak in general terms about their shared access to a key to Boundary Road. Since it is the agreed position of the parties that a key to Boundary Road was available to the accused, there is nothing in what the accused says about that fact in the recorded conversation that is probative of his guilt. The fact that it is the Crown case that the accused used the key to access the house and commit the murders does not make his bare confirmation that he had access to a key probative of guilt when his access to a spare key is not in issue.
	
	
	The third extract of 22 March 2010 commences after an indeterminate interval following the second extract. On one reading of what the accused says to his wife in this conversation, it might be thought that he is dictating the way in which she should respond, were she to be spoken to again by police, although even this is by no means clear. The question is whether, on a rational analysis of what is said, the extract admits sufficiently clearly of that construction to justify its admission under s 56 of the Evidence Act. It is necessary to extract that excerpt in its entirety to resolve that question:
	


K: Well if he/she accuse me then I’ll accuse you back; and then you will say this that and the other and that you ….

R: … I don’t feel so That’s not how I feel.

K: Like saying for instance that you this and that eh. Bring the prove. I’ll show to him/her then.

R: You, don’t you ask me …

K: … Ha …

R: … Don’t ask me if I got up at the middle of the night …

K: … Don’t ask …

R: … To do a pee. Just provide prove that I went out eh. (Sigh).

…

K: Do you have prove that we got up in the middle of the night; did a pee.

R: No. Only whether or not I went out that night. Saves the talk about things that are not related to the case. Whether I do a pee or not is immaterial.

K: Yes.

R: What’s that got to do with the case? I pee tonight and won’t pee tomorrow night who knows.

K: Who knows? Who can remember? (inaudible).

R: Or piddled how much.

K: (Giggles). Who can remember waking up or not on that night? He/she asked if that night er woke how many times eh. Sometimes wake up, and sometimes don’t. How do I know?

R: Hoping that I make mistakes while waiting for me to jump into it.


	
	Later in the same excerpt, the accused and his wife discussed both the time at which, according to Kathy Lin, it was “normal to go to sleep” (namely at 2 or 3 in the morning as she had told police in her interview of 20 July 2009), and what the accused would say if he were asked the same question.
	
	
	Rather than the accused coaching or dictating, or even suggesting to his wife how she should deal with any further police questions, they seem to agree that any questions that might later be asked of them with the intention that they attribute, with precision, the time they went to bed or to sleep, or the time they rose the next morning, should also be answered in terms of either generalities, or that they should both refuse to answer questions along these lines altogether.
	


K: How to? (Sighs) Just said it was. If it’s watching TV then watched TV or surfed the net. I think they are (ind) …

R: So, these things can annoy you to death ...

K: “At what time was it?” …

R: … (Inaudible) …

K: … “It was two or three o’clock, it is normal to go to sleep at two or three o’clock.”

R: If he/she came and asked me, I’ll say … …….

K: … He/she said: “What time you rise in the morning?” I said after Sometime past eight o’clock?” … (Loud clashing of crockery) … (Ind) and I said yes. He/she then said: “How do you know?” I said, “Roughly around that time” and that’s the truth …

R: … Roughly around that time will be right …

K: … As my son needed to go to school too. (Ind) routine …

R: … Roughly around that time …

K: … Every body has an individual biological clock, times up and then bounce up. For instance, now; six o’clock wake up but I wake up even before the alarm clock sounds.

R: (Ind) gets up (ind) (ind) formed habit.

K: But just wants to know; “How come you knew? Are you sure?”

R: Just roughly (ind) ...

(Loud squeak.)

K: …I know. So picky, those questions; so very difficult to put up with.

R: And so; turning this around on its head eh; if this happens at (ind) I will ask him/her. I will say I won’t answer anything. You go and prove things yourself. I won’t say anymore …

K: … Oh … Won’t say any more now. Now; question me next time; wont answer. Won’t allow you to go. Has to bring a lawyer along if it’s necessary to go …

R: … Go with lawyer. Was asking such tough questions …

K: But now it is like (ind) he/she making it sound so nice today; “You are not a suspect.” and so on and so forth …

R: … Hmmm. That is to say that, the law has stipulated … … that it had to be done this way, but the police is always circumvent. That is within the law itself, you are questioned like as if you are a suspect while in fact the law makes it clear that you aren’t. It is the police assuming that we are. Understand?


	
	While it might be open to the Crown to submit that the accused’s manipulation of his wife, with a view to having her conform to how he wants her to answer questions was subtle (so that it does not for that reason resonate in what he actually says), perhaps by directing the conversation (if that is what he is doing) so that his wife determines of her own volition to support his alibi, that is not a submission advanced by the Crown. Even if it were a submission to be advanced by the Crown, in the absence of tone or intonation informing what was said and with the added complexity inherent in a literal translation of Cantonese or Mandarin into English, any suggestion of the accused manipulating his wife in this way may not rise above mere assertion.
	
	
	On 25 March 2010, five days before the next set of the surveillance device transcripts upon which the Crown relies, police gave Kathy Lin copies of her interview of 20 July 2009. She was also asked by police to facilitate a meeting with Brenda Lin.
	


30 March 2010


	
	The Crown relied upon three discontinuous excerpts of conversation between the accused and his wife on 30 March 2010. The first extended over six pages, the second over ten pages and the third over eleven pages. Given the discontinuity of the excerpts (as with the discontinuity in the excerpts of 22 March), it was not suggested there was any textual or contextual sense that could be derived from reading the separate excerpts as a whole in order to enhance an understanding of what is being discussed in either of them. Accordingly, each excerpt needs to be separately considered for admission as bearing relevantly on a fact in issue as provided for in s 56 of the Evidence Act. The first excerpt on 30 March was most recently revised by the interpreters within days of the argument concerning admissibility. In this conversation the accused and his wife again refer back to Kathy Lin having had the assistance of a lawyer when she was interviewed on 22 March while the accused did not, as to which the accused said:
	


R: If your lawyer wasn’t there you would die too.

K: I am (ind) … …

R: … … How dangerous it was with what was said at that time eh! Are you able to testify … you can testify whether you woke up or not … whether s/he got up or not? Do you know that or not? I’m unable to vouch for myself …

K: … (Ind) …

R: … On that day s/he asked me; did you go straight away fall asleep? I said normal. Did you go out in the middle? No …

K: … And that is why I …

R: .. Did wake up or not? No.

K: … That is why … hey! That’s why that day when s/he asked me those questions I then realised that something is not right … …

R: … Very … very unsettling honestly … …

K: … … And that’s why I have to look look … look look for Lawyer Shen and that’s the reason why.

R: S/he is bent on doing away with me. This is laid bare and clearly on display. even when Jimmy came back, he/she said it is so that it is the will to do away with me.

K: It is …

R: … Almost done away and dead eh wifey. If I and you get into another disaster … just another; if you had not brought your lawyer, during that additional interview session where I didn’t bring a lawyer with me; an instant death, an immediate arrest might have eventuated. Enough evidence based on the face of it could have been established then. Besides that we would be deemed to have made certain admissions …

K: … Becomes our own doing …

R: … Very simply put, you too did not provide verbal testification that I wasn’t here

K: You too have no way of testifying that I wasn’t there … …

R: … I also have no way to testify that I myself wasn’t here. I also have no way to testify that you were not here. No one can prove it. “You said it all yourselves.” Says the police. “It is not me who forced you. Comes from your own mouth” …

K: Yes, comes from your own mouth, yes.

R: Shows that there are problems with you guys that night. … …

K: … … But now they are using those questions to trick us.


	
	The Crown Prosecutor identified passages within the second and third excerpts of conversations on 30 March 2010 as “crystallising” what he submitted was the accused’s position in relation to alibi (a submission which I understand to be directed to the accused making an implied admission that he had none). The following excerpts are expressly relied upon by the Crown as exemplifying that position:
	


R: … You, basically from the start eh; that night you … were together with me that entire night. In order for the police to prove that I wasn’t here …

K: … He/she has to find (ind) …

R: … First of all, s/he/they has/have to gouge open your mouth; secondly find someone …

K: … Has to find someone …

R: … To provide prove against me, that I was seen there …

K: … Yes eh saw you … saw you at such and such a place …

R: .. That will be strife …

K: … Yes …

	In the third excerpt, the accused and his wife revisit the fact that they understood the police had no evidence to contradict their joint account of being together from the time they arrived home late in the evening on 17 July 2009 through to the time the bodies of the deceased were discovered the following morning – an account with which Kathy Lin emphatically agrees, albeit, on the Crown case, in ignorance that she was sedated and could not actually account for her husband’s movements for that reason.
	


R: (Laugh) (Ind) well charge me. If you have the ability, charge me at once. Even if I’m beaten to death, I still won’t believe that evidence could be produced it’s that simple.

K: if there were any it would have been available early on …

R: … Is there any? If any, I would already have been dragged away like hell eh.

…

K: Why now? Several …

R: … Already eight months later.

K: Yes correct. Forcibly … forcibly …


	
	The Crown submitted that what the accused says in these two excerpts on 30 March 2010, properly and fairly interpreted, are eloquent of his guilt:
	


…what the Crown submits is that those are the words of a man who knows that he wasn't at home. If he knew that he was at home he wouldn't be suggesting to his wife that there is any risk at all of the police “gouging her mouth open” or finding someone who says that he was there.

…

He would not have been conjecturing that the police could conceivably find somebody, some witness, to say that he wasn't at home and that he was there.

…

He is acknowledging the reality that the police could conceivably find a witness who can prove that he wasn't at home but he is expressing his belief that they have no such witness because, if they did, he would have been arrested months earlier.


	
	Further, the Crown submitted:
	


It is the ruminations of a person who is acknowledging the risk that he has of a witness having emerged or emerging to give evidence of him having been seen out of the house that night. He is implicitly acknowledging that he has that risk of a witness coming forward and saying, ""I saw him out of the house that night"". That's what he is acknowledging the possibility of.

He is saying it is unlikely because the police would surely have charged him, but he is acknowledging that the only danger he faces, in light of his wife's support of his alibi, is if the police find such a witness.

Now, that acknowledges, implicitly, the fact that he was out of the house that night.


	
	I am unable to see that what is contended for by the Crown, in short, an implied admission that the accused does not have an alibi, is open. Although the accused repeats, perhaps with increasing emphasis, that there is no case against him, there is nothing in what he says that is suggestive of him importuning his wife to confirm that is the case, or that she should take that position against her genuine (albeit mistaken) belief that her husband was with her throughout the night, and nothing at all to suggest any collusion on her part to join with him in advancing a false alibi. There is nothing that I can discern which might rationally enable a jury to conclude otherwise.
	


6 April 2010


	
	The transcripts of 6 April 2010 relate to discussions, at this time involving Brenda Lin, as to how she might deal with questions the police may wish to ask of her concerning her various family relationships and the financial situation of her parents relative to the financial situation of the accused and his wife. The accused relates to her the detailed and repeated questions that police have asked him and her aunt about his movements on arriving home at Beck Street and openly complains about what he sees as a police strategy to test his reaction to their questions and their disinterest in his answers, as the following excerpt exemplifies:
	


R: S/he asked me, Da [familiar name for Brenda Lin], do you know how many questions s/he asked me about what time I went to bed? S/he said: “What time did you go to bed?” I said I forgot but for sure it was after 12am. “What time?” I said I really forgot. “What were you doing at that time?” “I was watching TV”. “What kind of program were you watching?” “It seemed ……sports or a weekend movie.” … “Do you still remember what it was about?” “I don’t remember.” “Do you wear a watch?” I said I never wore a watch. “Didn’t you say you were using a computer, there was a time indication on your computer, right?”

K: Didn’t you look at the time?

R: I said the time on my computer was China time. Apart from that, I normally didn’t look at it, nor could I remember. “What time was it exactly?” “Was Kathy going to bed first or you?” “What time was it?” “slept on the left hand side or right?” You don’t know how to answer these questions. Da. I do have a concern that these questions will be put to you… I mean some similar questions that they force you to answer and then, not care what your answers are, but to check your memory, check your response, check your reaction. These things are very annoying you understand? …(Ind)

K: …..(Ind) s/he also asked about “what do you normally do on Friday night” ……(Ind).

R: In fact I had told him/her long before, … I said “it was about 2 o’clock.” But this time, I dare not say it anymore.

K: I don’t remember, really don’t.

R: I really don’t remember. What if s/he say to me that “Hay, how come you remembered the 2o’clock but forgot everything else?

K: …………..(Ind) just said 2o’clock then 3o’clock.

R: And then s/he asked me “Do you remember that you sent any email at that night? I said “I usually don’t send any email.” “What about receiving any email?” S/he forced us to make sure on time. … (Ind) used so many questions to force me to make sure…It is very annoying… ..(Ind) I hope the questions to you would not…..(Ind) I’ve said the stress that we two have been going through… no one could understand. Da, you know. Why we hate your Grandma so much …? We never used to talk about “hatred”. Now, it’s indeed “hatred”. I never used to mention “hatred” to you, you know? …..(Ind).

K: ……..(Ind).

R: ….asked: “On that night, did you make any phone calls, send any emails?” … that is, s/he wanted you to recall when you did what.

K: ….(Ind).

R: As for sleeping, “Did you go to bed first or Kathy? I said I went to bed first. “How much earlier did you go to bed?” (laugh) It is so annoying. Da, what a hell this means? You don’t even know which one supposed to be the correct answer. You don’t even know if if you could be tricked by him/her or not. It is very very annoying. Do you know? Such as, Da, … “Why you remember your sleep yesterday……” “Why you remember a specific thing yesterday?” Then s/he will say “Did you deliberately not to tell that…” or “Did you make it up to keep the same…?” ……. They …(Ind) not a real…(Ind) psychologist.


	
	The accused’s recitation of what he had told police (and his wife’s commentary), and his concern that Brenda Lin might be questioned in a similar vein, does not advance proof of the accused’s guilt in any relevant sense.
	
	
	In the same conversation, the accused also openly discusses the explicit or implicit suggestions of her grandparents that he had killed her parents. Both the accused and his wife at separate times, in the same conversation, discuss the contentious issue of Brenda’s guardianship and advise her that she should be cautious about any police questions on that issue. At repeated points in that conversation, the accused says she must “tell the truth from her point of view … but that any questions that she feels she cannot answer she may choose not to answer”. He poses the following example: “Would it be possible that your Gufu [a nickname for the accused] might have killed your dad? How will you answer? It’s very difficult for you to answer isn’t it”. He went on to say, again as I fairly interpret it, that that is not a question that she should be required to answer and that any questions of that kind that she finds difficult to answer, she should simply refuse to answer. He also advised her that he had legal advice to the effect that the police were endeavouring to “trick” her aunt (the accused’s wife) with similar questions.
	
	
	I am unable to discern from any submissions advanced by the Crown any basis upon which the advice the accused gave Brenda would or might be probative of his guilt, if for no other reason than it is not suggested that she had any information which might be adverse to his interests. I note that the Crown eschewed any reliance of the accused’s advice to Brenda that she could or might refuse to answer the police questions, or might refuse to be interviewed altogether, because he was concerned that she might take the opportunity to reveal to police his sexual abuse of her.
	


29 April 2010


	
	The final extract of the surveillance device transcripts tendered by the Crown over objection was the transcript of 29 April 2010. That conversation relates to what I am satisfied, on a fair reading of it, is a reconstruction or re-enactment of the circumstances in which the body of Lily Lin was discovered, together with the accused’s directions to his wife as to how that occurred and what she should say about it. I am satisfied that this extract does have the capacity to rationally affect the jury’s assessment of the probability that the accused well knew what his wife would see were she to have walked, unchaperoned, into her brother’s bedroom and at a time when he was either not in the room or not in the room in a position to be able to see the bed, and that he was actively seeking to encourage her to the view that they both saw the body at the same time to deal with what he was aware police had concluded from his wife’s account of finding the deceased in that room. Whether the accused’s actions in seeking to shield his wife from the horror of Lily Lin’s grossly battered face and head was genuine or a pretence does not impact the admissibility of his recorded conversation with his wife where he either directs or encourages her to tell the police that their lines of sight were similar or the same. The following (discontinuous) extracts evidence that attitude:
	


R: What I mean is that you already had moved in for one meter [sic].

K: Here is … [Ind]

R: Just happened to be, hm, you then

K: Hm.

R: You were there, you were here

K: Hm, hm

R: And I was here.

K: Yes

R: Saw the whole view

K: I was still … [Incomplete]

R: Right at here?

K: Yes, that’s right.

…

R: Very simple, as long as you came in … … [Incomplete]

K: But ….. [Incomplete]

R: One step, you, hm, two steps, then ….. [Ind] three steps …. [Ind] could be ….. [Ind]

K: Saw everything, because you were, during that time, were in this position

R: Well, I was at here.

K: Yes, if, if ….. [Ind]

R: The door was like this.

K: Hm, hm, I was running like that. [Walking steps heard]

R: And then, you walked, and I walked after you, I was just like that, I had already, it was okay.

K: Yes

R: I was here, one metre, enough.


	
	In those circumstances, despite the limitations to which I have referred, I am not persuaded that the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger to which s 135 of the Evidence Act contemplates, or the unfair prejudice to which s 137 refers.

4771484,R v AA [2017] NSWCCA 84,"Judgment


	
	LEEMING JA: I agree with Beech-Jones J.
	
	
	R A HULME J: I agree with Beech-Jones J.
	
	
	BEECH-JONES J: This judgment concerns a Crown appeal against a sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Ellis DCJ on the Respondent for the commission of a number of serious sexual assaults on his two nieces when they were between the ages of five and eight years old. At the time of the commission of some of the offences the Respondent was a juvenile. Accordingly, neither the Respondent nor the victims can be identified (Crimes Act 1900, s 578A; Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, s 15A). To that end, the Respondent will be referred to as “AA” and his victims as “BB” and “CC”. They are not their initials.
	
	
	On 9 December 2016, AA was sentenced in the District Court for five offences to which he had pleaded guilty. The first offence was aggravated indecent assault on a person under the age of ten years contrary to former s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act. It was committed upon BB between 7 July 2008 and 21 December 2008. AA was fifteen years old and BB was five years old when the offence was committed. The maximum penalty for the offence was 10 years imprisonment. As AA was under eighteen years of age when the offence was committed, there was no applicable standard non‑parole period. For this offence, AA was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 14 months with a non‑parole period of 8 months commencing 31 December 2015.
	
	
	The second offence also involved a contravention of former s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act. It was committed between 1 January 2009 and 7 July 2009 when BB was still five years old and AA was either fifteen or sixteen years old. For this offence, AA was sentenced to another term of imprisonment of 14 months with a non‑parole period of 8 months. This sentence commenced on 31 March 2016.
	
	
	The third offence was having sexual intercourse with a person under the age of ten years, namely CC, contrary to former s 66A(1) of the Crimes Act. It was committed between 1 January 2010 and 15 November 2011 when AA was between sixteen years and ten months and eighteen years and eight months old. CC was aged either five or six years old. The maximum penalty for this offence was imprisonment for 25 years. For adult offenders there was a standard non‑parole period of 15 years for this offence. AA was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 4 years with a non‑parole period of 2 years and 3 months. This sentence commenced on 30 June 2016.
	
	
	The fourth offence was another contravention of former s 66A(1) committed against CC. The offence was committed between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2012 when CC was either seven or eight years old and AA was either eighteen or nineteen years old. For this offence AA was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 4 years and 9 months with a non‑parole period of 2 years and 9 months. This sentence commenced on 30 August 2016.
	
	
	The fifth offence was also a contravention of former s 66A(1) committed against CC. The offence was committed between 15 November 2012 and 25 November 2012 when CC was eight years old and AA was nineteen years old. For this offence, AA was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 5 years and 2 months with a non‑parole period of 2 years and 7 months. This sentence is due to commence on 31 May 2017.
	
	
	When being sentenced for the third offence, AA requested the Court take into account, on a “Form 1”, two offences under former s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act committed against CC between 1 January 2010 and 15 November 2010 (Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 32(1) (the “Sentencing Act”)). When being sentenced for the fourth offence, AA requested the Court take into account another offence under former s 66A(1) of the Crimes Act committed against CC between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2012 (the “Form 1 offences”).
	
	
	The total sentence imposed on AA was imprisonment for 6 years and 7 months commencing 31 December 2015 and expiring on 30 July 2022. He received a combined non‑parole period of 4 years expiring on 30 December 2019.
	
	
	The Crown now appeals the sentence pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. It accepts that to succeed on the appeal it must first establish the existence of an error of the kind referred to in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 505 (“House”); secondly, identify the sentencing principle that is said to be engaged by the errors (R v DH; R v AH [2014] NSWCCA 326 at [19]); and thirdly demonstrate that “the total sentence imposed — even if erroneously reached by the sentencing judge — was manifestly inadequate in the circumstances of this case” (R v Janceski [2005] NSWCCA 288 at [25] per Hunt AJA with whom Spigelman CJ at [1] and Howie J at [41] agreed) (“Janceski”). Even if those matters are established, the Crown must “negate any reason why the residual discretion of the Court of Criminal Appeal not to interfere should be exercised” (R v Hernando [2002] NSWCCA 489; 136 A Crim R 451 at [12] per Heydon JA cited in CMB v Attorney General for the State of NSW [2015] HCA 9; 256 CLR 346 at [34] per French CJ and Gageler J and [56] per Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ; “CMB”). Before those matters are addressed it is necessary to outline the facts of the offending and summarise the sentencing judgment.
	


The Offences


	
	Placed before the sentencing judge was an agreed statement of facts. What follows is a summary of those facts.
	
	
	AA is the paternal uncle of BB and CC. BB and CC are cousins. At the time of the offences AA lived with his parents. From time to time BB and CC visited AA’s home to be looked after by AA’s mother who is the grandmother of BB and CC.
	
	
	On an occasion between 7 July 2008 and 21 December 2008, BB was visiting AA’s home to be looked after by her grandmother. As noted, BB was then five years old and AA was fifteen years old. While BB was seated on a lounge with AA watching television, AA placed “his hand on her vagina over the top of her clothing”. AA’s conduct constituted the first offence noted at [4] above.
	
	
	Sometime between 1 January 2009 and 7 July 2009, BB was in AA’s bedroom sitting on his chest while he was lying on the bed. According to the agreed facts, AA “touched her vagina on top of her underwear and moved his finger on her vagina”. BB tried to stop him by moving away. AA’s conduct constituted the second offence noted in [5] above. The agreed facts stated that “[t]hese were not the only occasions that [AA] touched [BB] on the vagina”.
	
	
	The agreed facts also record that between 1 January 2010 and 15 November 2010 AA engaged in two indecent assaults upon CC similar to those he committed against BB. They were committed while AA and CC were sitting on a lounge watching television. These two indecent assaults constitute the first two Form 1 offences noted in [9].
	
	
	As noted, the third offence was committed between 1 January 2010 and 15 November 2011. CC was sleeping in the lounge room at AA’s home. AA approached CC while she was asleep. AA gave her some “Nutella” on a spoon. The agreed facts record that AA “removed her pants, spread her legs open and licked her vagina” and that CC told him to stop but he continued. The facts record that CC “described [AA] as licking ‘inside’ her vagina which made her cry because it hurt”. As noted, at the time of this offence CC was six years old and AA was “16, 17 or 18” years old. This conduct constituted the third offence noted above. The facts record that this “was not the only occasion that [AA] performed cunnilingus on [CC]”.
	
	
	Sometime between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2012, CC was in AA’s bedroom with the door closed. AA told her to get into bed with him. He pulled his pants down and told CC to “suck his penis saying ‘it’s like a lollipop’”. AA “guided” CC’s head onto his penis with his hand and she performed “fellatio on him”. As noted, at this time CC was seven or eight years of age and AA was eighteen or nineteen years of age. This conduct constituted the fourth offence. The facts record that this “was not the only occasion that [AA] had caused [CC] to perform fellatio on him”.
	
	
	Immediately after this offence was committed, AA told CC to take off her clothes. CC was lying on his bed. AA pushed her legs open and licked her vagina. CC told him to stop because it hurt. AA continued saying “if you want something, you have to like it”. This conduct constituted the third of the Form 1 offences noted in [9].
	
	
	The fifth offence was committed between 15 November 2012 and 25 November 2012 when CC was in AA’s bedroom with her brother. The police facts record that, while her brother was “fixing something, AA and CC were watching television on AA’s bed. They were covered by a blanket. AA removed CC’s underpants and pulled his own pants down. According to the police facts, AA “pushed his penis into her vagina”. CC told AA to stop but he said “No, you’ll like it”. According to the facts CC “squeezed her legs together but [AA] pushed his penis through her legs and into her vagina”. CC felt pain. At some point AA said “Didn’t that feel good” and CC responded “No, I hated it”.
	


The Investigation


	
	In light of the grounds of appeal, it is necessary to describe how AA’s crimes were discovered. This was also covered by the agreed facts.
	
	
	On Friday 16 October 2015, being approximately three years after the commission of the fifth offence, CC disclosed to a worker at an after school care centre that she was concerned for her cousins because “one of her uncles had touched them”. She also stated that “[a] man has touched me as well” and said it was her uncle. The worker reported the disclosure to her manager. The following Monday, 19 October 2015, the after school centre reported the disclosure to the “Children’s Services helpline”.
	
	
	On 23 October 2015, CC’s and BB’s parents were notified of the allegations. When asked about the allegations by her parents, BB confirmed that she had been “touched … on the vagina”. On the same day, AA’s mother was advised of the allegations. She spoke to AA on the telephone. He denied the allegations. However, in a later telephone call he asked his mother to come home to speak to him. When she returned home, AA said to her “well my Dad molested me when I went to his house ...”. It seems that AA’s parents had separated when he was young. AA’s mother asked him what he did to the girls. AA replied “I can’t say, you may as well put me in jail with my Dad”.
	
	
	On the evening of 23 October 2015, AA attended a police station. According to the agreed facts he stated that “I was sexually assaulted by my father. I have done things to my nieces like my Dad did to me”. AA was then arrested and interviewed. According the agreed facts, AA “made admissions to indecently assaulting the two complainants”. He was released. BB and CC were interviewed in November 2015 and December 2015 respectively. AA was rearrested on 31 December 2015 and interviewed again. He has remained in custody since that date. According to the police facts, during that interview he admitted to touching the vagina of both BB and CC “on four or five occasions”, performing cunnilingus on CC “several times” and having her “perform fellatio on him several times”. He also “admitted to placing his penis between [CC’s] legs against her vagina but denied penetration”.
	


The Sentencing Judgment


	
	In the sentencing judgment, his Honour noted that there was an agreed statement of facts and briefly referred to the salient details of the offences. His Honour also noted the maximum penalty and applicable standard non‑parole periods. I note the following nine points about the sentencing judgment.
	
	
	First, his Honour determined that AA would receive a discount in the “range of 20-25%” for his pleas of guilty.
	
	
	Second, his Honour considered the sentencing regime that would have been applicable had AA been prosecuted as a juvenile shortly after he committed the first three offences. Thus his Honour concluded that, with the first two offences, AA “would have been dealt with in the Children’s Court and would not have been committed” to the District Court, and if sentenced to imprisonment, “it would have been served in Juvenile Justice detention”. With the third offence, his Honour accepted that it was a “serious children’s indictable offence” (as defined in s 3 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act such that if AA had been prosecuted when he was under 21 years of age then he would have to have been dealt with “according to law” (Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act, ss 16 and 17). However, his Honour observed that, if he was under the age of eighteen at the time of sentencing, the Court “would have imposed a control order”. (The Crown contends this is incorrect). His Honour further observed that if AA was over 18 at the time of sentencing then the Court could have directed that he serve some part of the sentence as a “juvenile offender” until he attained the age of 21 (Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act; s 19(1)). His Honour stated:
	


“I mention all of those factors as they are matters that I will take into account in the same way as I would take into account a different sentencing regime in other cases of for instance, historical sexual abuse.”


	
	Third, his Honour appears to have concluded that AA was entitled to a discount in addition to his plea. His Honour noted the chronology of events outlined at [21] to [24] and stated:
	


“Having regard to the fact that [AA] came forward and made full admissions prior to the complaints, he is, in my view, entitled to an unspecified further ‘Ellis type’ discount.” (emphasis added)


	
	At a later point during the delivery of ex tempore reasons for judgment, his Honour inquired of the legal representatives whether any corrections were required. The Crown’s representative submitted that “full admissions” were not made on the first occasion that AA attended the police and were also not made when AA was interviewed on 31 December 2015. His Honour stated that he had only “meant to indicate that [AA had come] forward to admit that he had sexually abused the [children] … and then subsequently entered an interview after that at some stage”. His Honour did not qualify the earlier observation that an “unspecified further discount” was being applied.
	
	
	Fourth, his Honour made various findings concerning the circumstances of the offending that bore upon a determination of its objective seriousness. His Honour noted that, with the exception of the fifth offence, the offences were “reasonably spontaneous” in that “often other people [were] present within the house”. His Honour noted that “[e]ach offence was of short duration”. His Honour noted that the third offence involved an inducement. His Honour noted the respective ages of AA and the victims. His Honour noted the three year delay between the commission of the fifth offence and the offences being discovered. His Honour concluded that AA had “voluntarily ceased his conduct some time in 2012”. His Honour also cited the decision in Jonson v R [2016] NSWCCA 286 and referred to the fact of the offences having been committed in a “home” as an aggravating factor even though “[the offending] took place in the home of the offender while the victims were visiting”. No issue as to the correctness of that approach is raised on this appeal.
	
	
	Later in the sentencing judgment, his Honour characterised the objective seriousness of the offences. His Honour described each of the first two offences as “toward the lower end of the range” as they involved “touching on the outside of [BB’s] clothing”. His Honour stated that they would be at the “lowest end of the range” other than allowing for her age. In relation to the other three offences, his Honour stated:
	


“Having regard to the young age of the complainant, that is, [CC] was six for count 3, seven or eight for count 4, and eight for count 5, but that the offender was either 16, 17, 18 or 19 years of age during the course of those offences, that each offence was of relatively short duration, and apparently of a spontaneous nature, the offending, in my view, is below the mid level.

…

I can indicate that his youth is a large factor in my assessment of the criminality and of what the total effective sentence should be to reflect that criminality.” (emphasis added)


	
	Fifth, his Honour addressed AA’s personal circumstances. His Honour noted, and appeared to have accepted, AA’s statement that he had been sexually abused by his father. His father was due to be sentenced on “unrelated child sexual assault offences”. His Honour also noted that AA had no criminal history. By the time of sentencing, AA was 23 and his offending occurred from when he was aged 15 to aged 19. His Honour noted that a psychologist’s report was tendered at the sentencing hearing which referred to the impact on AA of his father’s conduct. It also stated that AA was socially dysfunctional and that as a teenager he suffered from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (“ADHD”) as well as “anger issues and impulsivity”.
	
	
	Sixth, his Honour accepted that AA was remorseful. His Honour considered this was demonstrated by AA’s cessation of offending three years before his actions were discovered and by his attendance at the police station on the evening of 23 October 2015. His Honour noted that he had expressed remorse to the psychologist whose report was tendered at the sentencing hearing. The report referred to AA “express[ing] regret for his offending behaviour and describ[ing] feeling guilty and ashamed of his crimes”.
	
	
	Seventh, his Honour felt unable to make a positive finding concerning AA’s prospects of rehabilitation. His Honour noted that AA “has been assessed as having a medium risk of reoffending without treatment” but that he was “amenable to treatment while in custody”. His Honour noted that AA’s youth when he ceased offending was a “positive factor” but added that the Court “would have to be prescient in order to finally determine what his prospects of rehabilitation are”.
	
	
	Eighth, his Honour made a finding of “special circumstances” for the purposes of s 44(2) of the Sentencing Act. His Honour identified five matters as supporting that finding, namely: AA’s youth; his “mental health issues” as referred to in the psychologist’s report; the necessity to assist in his “reintegration back into the community” given that AA was serving his first period in custody, the lengthy sentence of imprisonment and the effect of partial accumulation of the sentences.
	
	
	Ninth his Honour stated that he had taken into account the victim impact statements from BB and CC. In their statements they described their distress as a result of the offences. BB described the difficulties she had at school and how since the offending she had become “closed off” from her family and friends, including her cousins. She also described the breakdown in family relationships that followed from the discovery of the offences, which has been upsetting for her.
	


Grounds 1 and 2: Ellis Discount and Failure to Apply s 23(4)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act


	
	Ground 1 of the appeal contends that the sentencing judge erred in “applying an Ellis discount”. Ground 2 contends that the sentencing judge erred “by failing to state the penalty that would otherwise have been imposed pursuant to s 23(4)(b) of the Sentencing Act. These grounds can be dealt with together.
	
	
	As noted in the sentencing judgment, his Honour stated that AA would receive an unspecified “further Ellis type discount”. The reference to “Ellis” is to R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 (“Ellis”) which includes the following statement by Street CJ at 604:
	


“This Court has said on a number of occasions that a plea of guilty will entitle a convicted person to an element of leniency in the sentence. The degree of leniency may vary according to the degree of inevitability of conviction as it may appear to the sentencing judge, but it is always a factor to which a greater or lesser degree of weight must be given.

When the conviction follows upon a plea of guilty, that itself is the result of a voluntary disclosure of guilt by the person concerned, a further element of leniency enters into the sentencing decision. Where it was unlikely that guilt would be discovered and established were it not for the disclosure by the person coming forward for sentence, then a considerable element of leniency should properly be extended by the sentencing judge. It is part of the policy of the criminal law to encourage a guilty person to come forward and disclose both the fact of an offence having been committed and confession of guilt of that offence.

The leniency that follows confession of guilt in the form of a plea of guilty is a well recognised part of the body of principles that cover sentencing. Although less well recognised, because less frequently encountered, the disclosure of an otherwise unknown guilt of an offence merits a significant added element of leniency, the degree of which will vary according to the degree of likelihood of that guilt being discovered by the law enforcement authorities, as well as guilt being established against the person concerned.” (emphasis added)


	
	This passage adverts to the leniency that is proffered to an offender on the account of a plea of guilty and the possibility that a “further element of leniency” may be afforded in circumstances where the plea of guilty “is the result of a voluntary disclosure of guilt” such as in the circumstance “[w]here it was unlikely that guilt would be discovered and established were it not for the disclosure by the person coming forward for sentence”. This additional measure of leniency is often referred to as an “Ellis discount”.
	
	
	The above statement from Ellis is accommodated by two provisions of the Sentencing Act. First, s 21A(3)(i) provides that remorse shown by an offender is a mitigating factor and can be considered by a sentencing judge as part of the “instinctive synthesis”. If an offender discloses unknown offences to the police, that can be powerful evidence of their offender’s remorse. No separate discount should be given on account of remorse (R v Robert Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; 195 A Crim R 1 at [32] per Howie J; “Borkowski”).
	
	
	Second, s 23 of the Sentencing Act provides:
	


23 Power to reduce penalties for assistance provided to law enforcement authorities

(1)   A court may impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise impose on an offender, having regard to the degree to which the offender has assisted, or undertaken to assist, law enforcement authorities in the prevention, detection or investigation of, or in proceedings relating to, the offence concerned or any other offence.

(2)   In deciding whether to impose a lesser penalty for an offence and the nature and extent of the penalty it imposes, the court must consider the following matters:

(a)   (Repealed)

(b)   the significance and usefulness of the offender’s assistance to the authority or authorities concerned, taking into consideration any evaluation by the authority or authorities of the assistance rendered or undertaken to be rendered,

(c)   the truthfulness, completeness and reliability of any information or evidence provided by the offender,

(d)   the nature and extent of the offender’s assistance or promised assistance,

(e)   the timeliness of the assistance or undertaking to assist,

(f)   any benefits that the offender has gained or may gain by reason of the assistance or undertaking to assist,

(g)   whether the offender will suffer harsher custodial conditions as a consequence of the assistance or undertaking to assist,

(h)   any injury suffered by the offender or the offender’s family, or any danger or risk of injury to the offender or the offender’s family, resulting from the assistance or undertaking to assist,

(i)   whether the assistance or promised assistance concerns the offence for which the offender is being sentenced or an unrelated offence,

(j)   (Repealed)

(3)   A lesser penalty that is imposed under this section in relation to an offence must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.

(4)   A court that imposes a lesser penalty under this section on an offender because the offender has assisted, or undertaken to assist, law enforcement authorities must:

(a)   indicate to the offender, and make a record of the fact, that the lesser penalty is being imposed for either or both of those reasons, and

(b)   state the penalty that it would otherwise have imposed, and

(c)   where the lesser penalty is being imposed for both reasons—state the amount by which the penalty has been reduced for each reason.

(5)   Subsection (4) does not limit any requirement that a court has, apart from that subsection, to record the reasons for its decisions.

(6)   The failure of a court to comply with the requirements of subsection (4) with respect to any sentence does not invalidate the sentence.


	
	Sub-sections 23(4) to (6) were inserted with effect from 14 March 2011 by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment Act 2010.
	
	
	In CMB at [72], Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ held that disclosure by an offender to law enforcement authorities of otherwise unknown guilt involves the provision of assistance to law enforcement authorities within the meaning of s 23(1) and is thereby “subject to the stricture of s 23(3)”. French CJ and Gageler J adopted the same construction (at [41]). In such cases, sentencing judges are also required to comply with s 23(4) and specify the level of the discount proffered (see Panetta v R [2016] NSWCCA 85 at [34] per Adams J with whom Ward JA at [1] and Bellew J at [60] agreed in this respect). The combination of CMB and the introduction of s 23(4) to (6) rendered a change in the position previously adopted in this Court which was to the effect that the level of discount afforded on the basis of the disclosure of previously unknown offending did not need to be stated (see Borkowski at [32]).
	
	
	Beyond this, there is conflicting authority as to whether a sentencing judge’s failure to comply with s 23(4) necessarily results in an error of the kind referred to in House (see s 23(6) and s 101A; and compare Panetta at [34] to [37] with R v Robinson [2014] NSWCCA 12 at [42] per Basten JA (“Robinson)” and Avery v R [2015] NSWCCA 50 at [68]). Section 23(6) provides that the failure to comply with s 23(4) does not “invalidate the sentence”. However, s 101A provides that a “failure to comply with a provision of this Act may be considered by an appeal court in any appeal against sentence even if this Act declares that the failure to comply does not invalidate the sentence”. These provisions operate as a form of privative clause. Their combined effect is to negate any contention that a sentence imposed by a sentencing court that is not a superior court of record is affected by jurisdictional error by reason of a failure to comply with s 23(4). Instead, complaints about such failures fall to be considered as part of the appellate process.
	
	
	The end result is that, if sentencing judges are considering imposing a lesser sentence on account of the conduct of an offender in disclosing previously unknown offences, then they must consider the factors in s 23(2) in determining whether to proffer the discount (Williamson v R [2015] NSWCCA 250 at [68]) and, if so, its level. They also must ensure that the penalty imposed is not disproportionate (s 23(3)) and they must specify the level of discount in accordance with s 23(4). Irrespective of whether s 23 is engaged, sentencing judges may also consider whether the offender’s actions demonstrate remorse.
	
	
	In relation to Ground 1, the Crown contended that the sentencing judge “erred by failing to properly consider the factors in s 23(2)” of the Sentencing Act. The Crown submits that, had his Honour done so, then there would not have been applied an “unspecified further Ellis discount”. Ground 2 contends that the sentencing judge erred in failing to specify the level of discount. The submissions on behalf of AA contend that his Honour did not afford any “specific type of discount” but instead treated his attendance at the police station as “confirmation of the respondent’s remorse”. Otherwise, it was submitted on behalf of AA that the Court should not intervene merely because of a failure to comply with s 23(4) (citing Robinson at [42]).
	
	
	In this case there are reasons to doubt whether the form of “assistance” that AA provided on the evening of 23 October 2015 would fall within the passage from Ellis set out above. By the time AA attended the police station, the process for reporting BB and CC’s complaints to the police was already in train. Nevertheless, his actions in attending the police station in advance of the police being notified of the complaints, and in admitting some of the abuse, does fall within s 23(1).
	
	
	Accordingly, the real debate between the parties was whether the sentencing judge afforded a “discount”, albeit “unspecified”, on account of AA’s “assistance” or only considered his assistance as demonstrating his remorse. I consider that the sentencing judge adopted the former approach. The sentencing judge stated that he would give a “further discount” being a reference to a discount beyond that which was allowed for the utilitarian value of AA’s plea. When the Crown corrected his Honour’s initial finding that AA made full admissions on 23 October 2015, his Honour had the opportunity to clarify the statement that a further discount was being given but his Honour did not. In a separate part of the judgment his Honour expressly referred to AA’s actions in approaching the police as “confirmation of remorse” (see [33]).
	
	
	It follows from this conclusion that Ground 1 of the Crown’s appeal must be upheld. His Honour allowed a discount on account of AA’s assistance but in doing so failed to address the factors in s 23(2). In view of that conclusion it is not necessary to address the issue raised by Ground 2 as to whether error was established by the further failure of the sentencing judge to specify the level of discount in accordance with s 23(4).
	
	
	Further, it is appropriate to determine afresh whether, having regard to the factors in s 23(2), any discount was warranted, as that may be relevant to an assessment of whether the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate. In considering those factors it is to be recalled that when AA attended the police station the child protection authorities were already investigating BB’s and CC’s complaints. Further, AA did not initially confess to all his sexual acts with BB and CC. Instead, he only admitted to those acts that his family accused him of engaging in. In those circumstances, it was not established that what he provided on the evening of 23 October 2015 was ultimately of significance or especially timely in that the police would have been notified and would have ultimately interviewed BB and CC in any event (s 23(2)(b); s 23(2)(d)). The information he provided was not complete (s 23(2)(c)). AA did not obtain any other benefit from the assistance he provided (s 23(2)(f)). AA’s provision of assistance did not result in him suffering harsher custodial conditions (s 23(2)(g)) or injury to himself or his family (s 23(2)(h)). The assistance AA provided concerns the offence for which he is being sentenced (s 23(2)(i)). Bearing in mind that AA only attended the police station after he was notified of the complaints, when they were about to be reported anyway, and that his admissions were incomplete, I do not consider that the imposition of a lesser penalty on account of his assistance is warranted.
	
	
	Accordingly, I would uphold Ground 1 of the appeal. Ground 2 of the appeal does not arise.
	


Ground 3: The objective seriousness of Counts 3, 4 and 5


	
	Ground 3 of the appeal contends that the “sentencing judge erred in his Honour’s assessment of the objective seriousness of Counts 3, 4 and 5”.
	
	
	In the passage extracted in [31] above the sentencing judge assessed the objective seriousness of the third, fourth and fifth offences as “below the mid level”. The Crown accepted that this assessment is an evaluative one and is only reviewable for House error (Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282) at [46]). Nevertheless, the Crown contended that his Honour took into account irrelevant considerations in assessing the objective seriousness of these offences, namely, AA’s age and the duration of the offending.
	
	
	In relation to the age of AA, the Crown referred to the statement in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [27] (“Muldrock”) to the effect that, at least when considering offences to which a standard non‑parole period applies, the “objective seriousness of an offence is to be assessed without reference to matters personal to a particular offender or class of offenders”. Instead, the objective seriousness is “to be determined wholly by reference to the nature of the offending"" ([id]). Muldrock also distinguished between an assessment of the ""objective seriousness"" of an offence and an assessment of the offender's ""moral culpability"" for the offence (see Muldrock at [54]). An assessment of the latter can, and should, take into account matters personal to an offender such as his or her impaired intellectual functioning (see McLaren v R [2012] NSWCCA 284 at [29] per McCallum J, McClellan CJ at CL and Bellew J agreeing (“McLaren”); Elturk v R [2014] NSWCCA 61 at [33] to [34] per Beazley P). An assessment of moral culpability can also extend to an offender’s relative youth (see KT v R [2008] NSWCCA 51 at [22] to [25] per McClellan CJ at CL) although there are limits to its mitigating effect (JH v R [2017] NSWCCA 22 at [128]).
	
	
	In the passage set out at [31] above the sentencing judge expressly referred to AA’s youth as bearing on an assessment of his “criminality”. Considered in context, the reference to his “criminality” was a reference to his moral culpability. It follows that that aspect of his Honour’s reasons was not affected by error. However, in the earlier part of that extract his Honour expressly referred to AA’s age in the context of a determination of the objective seriousness of the offending (the “offender was either 16, 17, 18 or 19”). Nevertheless, in the context of a sexual offence some aspects of an offender’s personal circumstances may bear upon the “nature of the offending” (Muldrock at [27]). For example, the age difference between a sexual offender and their perpetrator can affect an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending. Additionally, the age of the perpetrator can be relevant to an explanation of the context in which the offending occurred. In the present case, AA was in his late teens when he committed the offences. He had not assumed responsibility for the care of BB and CC. It is likely, or at least possible, that BB and CC could distinguish between him and an adult. This does not deny or even mitigate the seriousness of his conduct and its terrible effect on the victims. However, at least in the present case, I do not accept that the sentencing judge erred in referring to the age of AA and his victims in assessing the objective seriousness of his conduct.
	
	
	Otherwise, I do not accept that his Honour erred in referring to the “relatively short duration” of the offending in assessing the objective seriousness of the third, fourth and fifth offences. The Crown contended that the agreed facts did not “suggest any particular time period relating to these counts” so as to enable his Honour to draw a conclusion about these offences. However, the description of the events and the context in which they occurred, namely while the children were in the care of AA’s mother, enabled his Honour to make the finding that was made. While the short duration of a sexual assault “would not ordinarily be considered as a factor which reduces the objective seriousness” of such an offence (R v Daley [2010] NSWCCA 223 at [48]; Cowling v R [2015] NSWCCA 213 at [16]), it was open to His Honour to have some regard to it (see Russell v R [2010] NSWCCA 248 at [61]).
	
	
	This ground of appeal was ultimately directed to his Honour’s finding as to the objective seriousness of the third, fourth and fifth offences. At first instance, the Crown submitted that the third offences fell “within the mid-range for offences of this nature” and the fourth offence fell “in the middle of the range for such offences”. His Honour found that they both were “below the mid-level”. The distinction between the Crown’s submission and his Honour’s finding for both offences is barely material. In any event, I do not accept that his Honour erred in this respect.
	
	
	The position is not the same with the fifth offence. This offence involved the penile penetration of an 8 year old girl in circumstances that caused her pain and in which she protested. I do not accept that it was open to his Honour to characterise the offence as “below the mid level”. To the contrary, I consider that it was above the middle of the range of objective seriousness. Further, given that AA was nineteen when the offence was committed his moral culpability was heightened compared to the other offences.
	
	
	I uphold Ground 3 in relation to the fifth offence but reject it in relation to the third and fourth offences.
	


Ground 4: Punishment under the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987


	
	Ground 4 of the appeal contends that the sentencing judge erred “by taking into account irrelevant considerations concerning the possible outcome had the respondent’s offending been detected earlier and by mistaking the effect of the [Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act]”.
	
	
	This ground of the appeal refers to that part of the sentencing judgment noted at [27]. The Crown contends that his Honour erred in having regard to the sentencing options that were open under the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act had AA been prosecuted as a juvenile shortly after he committed the first three offences. It also contends that his Honour erred in concluding that AA could have received a “control order” under s 33(1) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act for the third offence. The Crown contends that, as the third offence was a “[serious] children’s indictable offence it had to be dealt with according to law” (Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act; s 17). The result is that, if AA had been prosecuted as a juvenile, he would have been dealt with in accordance with the Sentencing Act which would have precluded the imposition of a control order (see R v KBM [2004] NSWCCA 123 at [20]).
	
	
	Counsel for AA, Mr Fernandez, submitted that, in addressing this issue, the sentencing judge was merely referring to submissions made before him on this topic. He submitted that his Honour was only “describing the complicated sentencing task before him, and the way the different sentencing regimes for children and adults operated”. He submitted that the sentencing judge was referring “by analogy, to another circumstance where sentencing is complicated in this way, [namely] sentencing for historical sexual abuse”.
	
	
	A review of the transcript of the sentence hearing reveals that it was the sentencing judge who first introduced the topic of the sentencing regime that would have been applicable for the first three offences had AA been prosecuted immediately after he committed them. Consistent with the statement set out at [31] above, his Honour asked whether he should “take into account that had [AA] been charged [for the first and second offence] while he was still under 18 ... [the matter] … would have stayed in the Children’s Court ...”. Counsel for AA embraced the proposition. The Crown’s representative did not expressly reject it.
	
	
	I do not accept that the sentencing judge merely referred to the provisions of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act as part of a recitation of the submissions made during the sentencing hearing. Instead, his Honour had regard to that legislation as a matter in mitigation of sentence. His Honour stated he would consider the regime for sentencing children “in the same way as I would take into account a different sentencing regime in other cases of, for instance, historical sexual abuse”. This is clearly a reference to the arguably analogous proposition that in sentencing for offences involving historical sexual abuse it is proper for a sentencing court to take into account the sentencing practice prevailing as at the date of commission of the offence charged when sentencing practice has moved adversely to an offence since that time (R v MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129; 54 NSWLR 368 at [31] per Spigelman CJ, at [71] per Grove J and at [105] per Sully J).
	
	
	Neither of the parties referred to any previous decisions of this Court that have addressed whether a sentencing court, in dealing with an adult offender for an offence committed while they were a juvenile, can have regard to the sentencing regime available for juveniles had they been prosecuted earlier. However, this issue has been addressed by this Court. In TC v R [2016] NSWCCA 3, this Court found error in circumstances where a fifty‑five‑year‑old offender was sentenced for an offence he committed when he was seventeen years old. The judge at first instance was found to have erred in failing to specifically address the statutory regime for the sentencing of children prevailing at the time the offence was committed (at [42] to [48] per Gleeson JA with whom Rothman and Bellew JJ agreed, at [88] to [89]). Similarly, in SHR v R [2014] NSWCCA 94, Fullerton J accepted that an offender who was thirty nine years old but had committed serious sexual assaults when he was 16 years of age had the capacity to “ask what might have happened had he been arrested and dealt with expeditiously after the offending” (at [50]; Basten JA and Davies J agreeing). However, it was of no assistance to the offender in that case as his offences were “serious children’s indictable offences” that had to be dealt with according to law and not in accordance with the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act (at [50] per Fullerton J).
	
	
	It follows that so much of Ground 4 as makes complaint in relation to the sentencing judge’s approach to the relevance of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act to the sentencing of AA for the first two offences, must be rejected. His Honour was entitled to adopt the approach that he did in relation to those two offences.
	
	
	However, his Honour erred in his approach to the third offence in this respect. Given that it was, and is, a “serious children’s indictable offence” it had to be dealt with according to law and that could not have included the imposition of a control order.
	
	
	I would reject so much of Ground 5 as concerns the first two offences. I would uphold Ground 5 in relation to the third offence.
	


Ground 5: AA’s youth


	
	Ground 5 of the appeal contends that the “sentencing judge erred by taking into account [AA’s] youth when finding special circumstances”.
	
	
	The matters relied on by the sentencing judge in finding special circumstances are set out at [35]. The Crown’s written submissions noted that the sentencing judge took into account AA’s youth when having regard to the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act, in observing that considerations of general deterrence do not have the same force for a young offender as they do for an older adult, in finding that AA’s conduct ceased when he was 19 and in determining both the objective seriousness of the offences and his “criminality”. I have already addressed complaints about the first and last of these matters.
	
	
	The Crown contended that, having considered AA’s youth in those various respects, his Honour erred by further taking into account his youth in finding special circumstances. The Crown submitted that was an impermissible form of double counting in that matters taken into account in reducing the head sentence should not be used to reduce the non‑parole period. The Crown referred to R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 at [47] (“Simpson”) and R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [18] per Spigelman CJ (“Fidow”).
	
	
	The relevant passage from Fidow is as follows (at [18]):
	


“‘Double counting’ for matters already taken into account in reducing the head sentence, and therefore already reflected in the non parole period, must be avoided. (See Simpson at [47]). Almost all matters capable of constituting special circumstances have usually been taken into account in determining the head sentence and sentencing judges should ensure that double counting does not occur”.


	
	The reference to “Simpson at [47]” in this passage appears to be a mistake in that [47] of Simpson does not address this topic. It may have been intended to be a reference to Simpson at [67] in which Spigelman CJ stated:
	


“Where a circumstance is taken into account by way of reduction of the head sentence, the application of the statutory proportion will have the result that the circumstance also reduces the non-parole period. Before a sentencing judge further reduces the non-parole period by reason of that circumstance, he or she must undertake a process of analysis which travels beyond that which has been undertaken in the course of determining the head sentence.”


	
	This passage informs what is meant by the reference to double counting for “matters already taken into account in reducing the head sentence” in the above extract from Fidow. A sentencing judge may be found not to have engaged in “double counting” if the analysis of the relevance of a particular circumstance to the non‑parole period “travels beyond” the analysis of its relevance to the head sentence. Thus, for example, matters which are purely subjective to the offender, such as their ill health or the effect of their plea of guilty, do not warrant a reduction in the head sentence and a further reduction in the non‑parole period (see Bell v R; Jelisavac v R [2009] NSWCCA 206 – medical condition; and Trindall v R [2013] NSWCCA 229 at [17] – plea of guilty). For such factors the analysis of their relevance to the head sentence and the non‑parole period is usually the same.
	
	
	However, in this case I do not accept that there was any relevant form of double counting. The analysis of the relevance of AA’s youth to the head sentence was different to the analysis of its relevance to the non‑parole period. With the former, AA’s youth was considered by the sentencing judge as part of the determination of his moral culpability and the objective seriousness of the offence. It was also considered when the sentencing judge had regard to the relevant sentencing regime for juveniles in determining the appropriate sentence for the first two offences (and erroneously in sentencing for the third offence). Thus, in the determination of the head sentence AA’s youth was not considered by the sentencing judge to be some generally mitigating circumstance. It was considered in that way as part of the determination of special circumstances, but only because, when considered with other factors, it bore upon the assessment that a longer period of supervision was required as part of AA’s rehabilitation. His Honour did not err in this respect.
	
	
	Before the sentencing judge, the Crown accepted that the combination of AA’s need for treatment, his age and the fact that it would be his first time in custody “could allow the Court to make a finding of special circumstances in this case”. This is arguably inconsistent with this ground of appeal although, as I have explained, the substance of the complaint was the reliance by the sentencing judge on AA’s youth in determining the head sentence and finding special circumstances. In any event, for the reasons set out above, I would reject Ground 5.
	


Ground 6: Accumulation


	
	Ground 6 of the appeal contends that the “sentencing judge failed to sufficiently accumulate the sentences”. The Crown’s submissions accepted that the sentencing judge had regard to Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 but submitted that the accumulation between the sentences did not “adequately reflect the totality of the criminality”.
	
	
	The sentence for the second offence was partially accumulated on the first offence by three months and the sentence for the third offence was partially accumulated on the second offence by three months. The sentence for the fourth offence was partially accumulated on the sentence for the third offence by two months and the sentence for the fifth offence was accumulated on the fourth sentence by a further nine months.
	
	
	A determination by a sentencing judge that sentences should or should not be accumulated is discretionary (R v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 219 at [37]). The Crown’s complaint that, even though his Honour accumulated sentences and referred to the appropriate principles, the sentences are not “sufficiently” accumulated, does not raise a complaint of an error of the kind referred to in House. However, I will treat the Crown’s complaint as if it asserted that the sentencing judge’s determination was “unreasonable or plainly unjust” such that this Court could “infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion” to accumulate sentences or make them run concurrently (House at p 505). Even treating the complaint in that way, I do not consider that it is established. While the accumulation of a period of two months for the fourth offence was lenient I am not persuaded that it or the other periods of accumulation reveal that the sentencing judge’s discretion was exercised “unreasonably”.
	
	
	I would reject Ground 6.
	


Ground 7: Individual sentences are each manifestly inadequate


	
	Ground 7 of the appeal contends that the “terms and non-parole periods of the individual sentences are each manifestly inadequate and ‘plainly unjust’”.
	
	
	The Crown’s submissions referred to the seriousness with which sentencing Courts regard offences committed against children (R v CJP [2004] NSWCCA 188 at [21]) and the necessity to ensure that “sexual assaults upon young children, especially by those who stand in a position of trust to them, must be severely punished” (R v Fisher (1989) 40 A Crim R 442 at 445). They also noted that the agreed facts concerning the first four offences record that each act was not the only occasion that the respective offence occurred. Such a statement has been held as “appropriate to be taken into account for purposes of rejecting any claim to mitigation and attendant reduction of an otherwise appropriate sentence” but is not “to be taken into account as a circumstance of aggravation” (R v JCW [2000] NSWCCA 209; 112 A Crim R 466 at [68] per Spigelman CJ). Further, as each of the third and fourth offences was accompanied by offences on a Form 1, the sentencing for those offences was required to be undertaken in a manner consistent with what Bathurst CJ stated in Abbas, Bodiotis, Taleb and Amoun v R [2013] NSWCCA 115 at [22] to [23].
	
	
	The Crown’s submissions did not specifically address the sentence imposed for the first two offences. At the time they were committed, AA was fifteen or sixteen years old. There was no standard non‑parole period for those offences. When they were committed AA had no prior convictions and a strong subjective case, especially given his father’s conduct towards him. AA admitted these offences on the evening of 23 October 2015. He later pleaded guilty. In those circumstances a combined sentence of 17 months imprisonment with a total non‑parole period of 11 months for the first two offences was certainly not manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	The position is less clear with the third, fourth and fifth offences. As part of the assessment of the adequacy of the sentences for the fourth and fifth offences, the Crown provided a table identifying some sentences imposed or considered by this Court for offences against former s 66A(1) or (2) committed by offenders aged between eighteen and twenty-five years. I will not describe all of those decisions. Instead, a consideration of some of them will suffice.
	
	
	In R v Ronald King [2009] NSWCCA 117 (“King”) this Court allowed a Crown appeal against a 2 year suspended sentence imposed on a 23 year old male who broke into a home and digitally penetrated a four-year-old girl and also indecently assaulted her. This Court concluded that the offending was “only slightly below [the] mid range in seriousness” (at [48]). The offender had a long criminal record but it did not include any sexual offences (at [17]). This Court imposed a non‑parole period of 4 years and 6 months with a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months. The Court described this as a “sentence of significantly less severity than should have been imposed” by the sentencing judge (at [71]). King was decided prior to the enactment of s 68A of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. Accordingly, the sentence imposed by this Court in King reflected the principle that following a successful Crown appeal this Court will impose a sentence that is either at the bottom of the applicable range (see R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 at 232 per Spigelman CJ) or towards the bottom of that range (Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CR 321 at [62]). After the enactment of s 68A the position is that, if this Court intervenes, it will impose the penalty that is appropriate (R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49; 77 NSWLR 7).
	
	
	In AAT v R [2011] NSWCCA 17 (“AAT”), this Court allowed an appeal against a sentence imposed for three offences against former s 66A and two child pornography offences. One of the offences against former s 66A had a charge of aggravated indecent assault included on a Form 1 (at [3]). The offender was twenty-two years of age and the victim was his eight‑year‑old half-brother (at [6]). The three offences under former s 66A involved the offender and the victim performing oral sex on each other (at [14]). One of the child pornography offences concerned photos of the victim that had been taken by the offender (at [13]). The offender had no prior convictions and a history of depression (at [17]). He had pleaded guilty and proffered assistance that involved nominating others who had committed child sex tourism and child pornography offences (at [29]). This Court concluded that the assistance and his plea were not such as would “warrant a discount in excess of 50%”. In resentencing the offender, this Court imposed non‑parole periods of 4 years 3 months, 3 years 3 months and 3 years 3 months for the three offences under s 66A respectively. The overall sentence imposed was a non‑parole period of 5 years and 6 months and a balance of term of 2 years.
	
	
	In Jones v R [2012] NSWCCA 262 (“Jones”), the offender was convicted following a trial of two offences under former s 66A(1) and indecently assaulting the victim. The offender was twenty years of age and attended at a home of a friend where the six year old victim was staying with his family. The offender stated that he was taking the victim to a shop but instead drove him to a secluded spot. The first offence under former s 66A was constituted by the offender sucking the victim’s penis. The second offence was committed when the offender anally penetrated the victim (at [7]). The indecent assault was committed the next day when the offender played with the complaint’s penis. An appeal to this Court against conviction was dismissed but an appeal against sentence was allowed. The offender was resentenced to a non‑parole period of 3 years imprisonment in respect of the first offence under former s 66A(1) and 8 years imprisonment in respect of the second offence.
	
	
	AA’s offending was similar to, but less than, the criminality of the offenders in AAT and Jones. AAT’s use of the victim for child pornography arguably makes his total criminality the worst of these examples. Like AAT and King but unlike Jones, AA pleaded guilty to the charges against him. Unlike King, AA is not eligible to receive a discount for assistance.
	
	
	Overall, a consideration of these sentences and the other sentences referred to by the Crown confirms that the sentences imposed on AA for the third, fourth and fifth offences were undoubtedly very lenient, especially when the sentences are corrected for the errors that have been identified. However, I am not persuaded that, considered either individually or in their totality, the sentences for those offences or any of the offences were manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	I would reject Ground 7.
	


Disposition


	
	Even allowing for the errors made by the sentencing judge, I am not persuaded that the sentences imposed, considered individually or in their totality, were “manifestly inadequate in the circumstances of this case” (Janceski at [25]).
	
	
	I propose that the appeal be dismissed.

6073719,R v Akkouche [2016] NSWDC 434,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: On Monday this week I commenced a trial involving allegations that the accused, Bilal Akkouche, supplied a prohibited drug, namely, 3-4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine also known as MDMA and also known as ecstasy. That charge was based on Mr Akkouche being found to be in possession of 31 capsules containing ecstasy. He was seen by a police officer at the Ivy Bar on New Year’s Day 2015 to react when a police dog entered the pool bar area by standing up from where he was, leaving behind a tin of mints. The police officer picked up the tin, approached Mr Akkouche and questioned him. From that moment on Mr Akkouche was cooperative with police. He immediately admitted possession. He told police the drugs were for his own use. He was charged with possession and issued a court attendance notice. Sometime later that charge was upgraded to supply and it was on that charge that he faced trial this week.
	
	
	During the course of the trial Mr Akkouche gave evidence. He confirmed what he had told police, confirmed that he was in possession of drugs, but said that he intended to use them all himself. He denied that he was going to supply any or all of those capsules.
	
	
	The jury, after perhaps lengthier deliberations than I would have expected, acquitted Mr Akkouche, being satisfied on the balance of probabilities that he was going to use the drugs himself.
	
	
	In the course of his evidence Mr Akkouche explained the nature of his drug habit. In the months leading up to his arrest he said that he would, effectively, party every weekend, starting on a Friday evening and ending in the early hours of a Monday morning. Over the course of that weekend he would consume ecstasy tablets regularly, so much so that he could, if his evidence was believed, have easily consumed those 31 tablets that he was found in possession of in a single weekend.
	
	
	Mr Akkouche gave evidence also that he did not actually buy those 31 tablets, they were given to him as a belated birthday present by a man he met up with at the Ivy Bar.
	
	
	Consistent with what he said to police and the evidence that he gave during his trial, when the Crown asked me to deal with the backup possession charge on a s 166 certificate Mr Akkouche pleaded guilty to that charge. In exercising the powers that are thus given to me I am bound by the jurisdictional limit which applies in the Local Court.
	
	
	Although Mr Akkouche’s plea of guilty came after his acquittal on the supply charge it is consistent with what he told police from the very beginning and consistent with an offer he made to the prosecution at the Local Court stage that he would, in fact, plead guilty to possession. Accordingly, I will allow the maximum 25% discount to which Mr Akkouche is entitled, because of the utilitarian value of his plea offer.
	
	
	I take into account that facing trial for supply, a charge which the jury has found him not guilty of, is itself punishment to some extent. No doubt the clear possibility that he would be convicted of supply and then perhaps even go to gaol would have had a profound effect upon him.
	
	
	Mr Akkouche gave evidence, both in the trial and in sentencing proceedings today, as to the change that has come about since he was arrested. Although, as I have explained, in the months leading up to his arrest he was a regular and enthusiastic consumer of MDMA, he says that since his arrest he has not used any form of illegal drug whatsoever. He said that his arrest was a wakeup call, that he no longer associates with the people he used to associate with and now recognises the harm that using and supplying drugs can cause.
	
	
	He continues to work as a carpenter form worker and has to a very large extent turned his life around from the way it was headed at the time he was arrested. He is now associated with a charity called Homeless Run the White Coats. An email from one of the organisers of that charity was tendered today which says that he is an exceptional member of the team. Mr Akkouche has plans for the future and wishes to start his own business and plans this very day to get engaged. It is pleasing to see that Mr Akkouche has the strength of character that he was able to make such a fundamental change in his life. He is now entitled to be proud as to the position he is in, especially when he compares himself with the position he was in at the time of his arrest.
	
	
	The question ultimately becomes as to what sentence to impose upon Mr Akkouche. Mr Thomas made a submission that the matter could be dealt with by way of an order s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing) Procedure Act. Mr Thomas relied on a single case in support of that submission in an effort to demonstrate that such an outcome was within the range of sentences to be imposed for sentences of this kind. Reliance on a single case in that manner has been described by the Court of Criminal Appeal, or at least one member of it, as a submission which is deeply flawed. I am familiar with that decision, because it was me who tried to impress upon the Court of Criminal Appeal that argument and it was my argument which was described in that manner. As a fall-back position Mr Thomas submitted that an order under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act would be appropriate. The difference is, of course, the conviction. I have little doubt that Mr Akkouche will be able to comply with any bond imposed upon him, whether under s 10 or s 9. So the difference in the two outcomes is, as I have said, one involves Mr Akkouche having a criminal conviction and one does not.
	
	
	There will be consequences for Mr Akkouche of a conviction. He occasionally works as a security guard and there will probably be difficulties with him in that career in the event that a conviction is imposed. Mr Akkouche, like many people, especially young people, wishes to travel overseas and a submission was made by Mr Thomas that his conviction might cause him difficulties in travelling overseas. In the absence of evidence that a conviction will preclude him travelling to any specific country that is not a finding I am prepared to make. I am prepared to accept that there is a risk that a conviction will make it harder for him to travel overseas, but the extent of that risk is not something I can really assess.
	
	
	It remains important to consider the purposes of sentencing. In this case rehabilitation and personal deterrence have little part to play, but general deterrence remains of importance. As Mr Akkouche belatedly realises, drugs are terrible things. People who use drugs have their lives affected adversely in very many ways and the effects extend beyond the individual users of those drugs. It may be, as evidence in the trial suggests, that ecstasy use amongst young people is relatively common, but the criminal justice system cannot simply throw up its hands and say “well we give up”. It is important when ecstasy use remains illegal, because of the harm that it causes to drug users, that those who are arrested in possession of substantial quantities of ecstasy are punished so that others who may be tempted to what Mr Akkouche did might reflect on their behaviour and hopefully will be less likely to possess and use drugs, as Mr Akkouche did. For that reason I am satisfied that a s 10 bond does not act as an appropriate general deterrent.
	
	
	The order I therefore make is that Mr Akkouche is convicted. I order that he enter into a bond under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to be of good behaviour for 18 months from today. The conditions of that bond are that he is to commit no criminal offences. He is to advise the Registrar of this Court of any changes in his residential address and he is to appear before this Court if called upon to do so at any time.

KIEFEL CJ, BELL AND GORDON JJ.   The appellant, the prosecution, alleged 
that,  while  in  custody  pending  sentence  for  sex  offences,  the respondent, 
Mr Holliday, offered another inmate, Mr Powell, a reward for organising people 
outside prison to kidnap two witnesses, force them to adopt a statement prepared 
by Mr Holliday that was designed to exculpate him of the sex offences, and then 
kill them.  Mr Powell did not go through with the plan and reported Mr Holliday. 

Mr  Holliday  was  tried  on  indictment  before  a  judge  and  jury  in  the 
 
Supreme  Court  of  the  Australian  Capital  Territory  on  five  counts.    Count  1 
charged that  Mr Holliday  ""attempted by  his  conduct to intentionally  pervert the 
course of justice"" contrary to ss 44 and 713(1) of the Criminal Code 2002 (ACT).  
Mr Holliday  was  convicted  on  that  count.    Counts  2  and  3  charged  that 
Mr Holliday ""committed the offence of incitement in that he urged [Mr Powell] 
to  murder""  each  witness  contrary  to  s 47  of  the  Criminal  Code  and  s 12  of  the 
Crimes Act 1900 (ACT).  Mr Holliday was found not guilty on these counts. 

 
Counts  4  and  5  charged  that  Mr  Holliday  ""committed  the  offence  of 
incitement in that he urged [Mr Powell] to kidnap"" each witness contrary to s 47 
of the Criminal Code and s 38 of the Crimes Act.  The prosecution conducted its 
case  alleging  that  Mr Holliday  urged  Mr Powell  to  procure  a  third  person  to 
kidnap each witness.  Mr Holliday was convicted on these counts. 

 
Mr Holliday appealed against his convictions to the Court of Appeal of the 
Supreme  Court  of  the  Australian  Capital  Territory.    His appeal  on  count  1  was 
dismissed.    The  verdicts  on  counts 4  and  5  were  set  aside  and  verdicts  of  not 
guilty were entered; these counts are the subject of the appeal to this Court. 

 
In  general  terms,  this  appeal  is  concerned  with  a  situation  in  which 
Person A  incites  Person B  (or  persons  generally)  to  undertake  a  course  of 
conduct  that  might  ultimately  result  in  Person C  committing  a  substantive 
offence.    That  form  of  conduct  is  not  uncommon  and  is  not  to  be  condoned.  
The question  is  what  offence  or  offences  under  the  Criminal  Code  attach  to  the 
conduct of Person A.   

 
Section  47(1)  of  the  Criminal  Code  provides  that  a  person  commits  the 
offence  of  incitement  if  the  person  ""urges  the  commission  of  an  offence"" 
(emphasis added).  Section 45(1) of the Criminal Code relevantly provides that a 
person  is  ""taken  to  have  committed  an  offence""  if  the  person  procures  the 
commission of the offence by someone else.   

 
At  issue  in  this  appeal  is  whether  Mr Holliday  could  be  convicted  of 
urging  the  commission  of  the  offence  of  kidnapping,  contrary  to  s 47  of  the 
Criminal  Code,  by urging  Mr Powell  to  procure  a  third  person  to  kidnap.  
The parties identified two questions.  The first question was whether inciting the

procurement  of a substantive offence (here, kidnapping) is an offence under the 
Criminal  Code.    The  second  question  was  whether  ss 45(2)(a)  and  45(3)  of  the 
Criminal  Code  are  ""limitation[s]  or  qualifying  provision[s]""  within  the  meaning 
of s 47(5) of the Criminal Code. 

 
As  these  reasons  will  demonstrate,  there  is  no  offence  of  incitement  to 
procure in the Criminal Code.  If that is a gap or omission in the Criminal Code, 
that gap or omission cannot be filled or resolved by resort to the text or structure 
of  the  Criminal  Code  or  its  legislative  history1.    If  the  legislature  wishes 
incitement  to  procure  to  be  a  discrete  offence  under  the  Criminal  Code 
(and, given the serious nature of the conduct, that is an available view), then that 
is  a  matter  for  the  legislature  to  consider;  and  it  is  for  the  legislature, 
if appropriate, to expressly provide for that offence.  

 
Accordingly,  the  second  question  –  whether  ss 45(2)(a)  and  45(3)  of  the 
Criminal  Code  are  ""limitation[s]  or  qualifying  provision[s]""  within  the  meaning 
of  s 47(5)  of  the  Criminal  Code  –  is not  reached.    The  appeal  should  be 
dismissed.   

 
These  reasons  will  address  the prosecution  case  at  trial,  the  Court  of 
Appeal's  decision,  the  statutory  framework  and  then  whether  inciting  the 
procurement of a substantive offence is an offence under the Criminal Code. 

Prosecution case at trial 

Counts 4  and  5  charged  that  Mr  Holliday  ""committed  the  offence  of 
 
incitement in that he urged [Mr Powell] to kidnap"" each witness contrary to s 47 
of the Criminal Code and s 38 of the Crimes Act. 

In  the  prosecution's  opening  address,  the  prosecutor  said  that  it  was  ""not 
 
alleged  that  [Mr  Holliday]  intended  [Mr  Powell]  to  commit  the  kidnapping  ... 
personally  as  he  was  in  prison  himself  at  the  time,  rather  that  Mr  Powell  was 
urged to procure other people or other persons to commit the offence"".  Procuring 
others  was  said  to  be  ""just  a  mechanism  by  which  [the  prosecution]  would  say 
[Mr Holliday] urged [Mr Powell] to commit"" the offence of kidnapping.  Indeed, 
the  prosecution  case  statement  referred  to  s 45  of  the  Criminal  Code  in 
addressing the elements of counts 2 to 5.  Mr Holliday did not object to, or raise 
any  complaint  about,  this  aspect  of  the  prosecution  case  statement  or  the 
prosecution's opening address.

At the close of the prosecution case, Mr Holliday made an unsuccessful no 
 
case submission in relation to counts 2 to 5.  In the course of submissions relating 
to  that  application,  there  was  a  discussion  between  the  trial  judge  and  the 
prosecutor  about  whether  s 47  could  operate  with  s 45.    That  discussion  reveals 
that  the  prosecution  thought  it  necessary  to  rely  on  s 45  to  attach  criminal 
liability to Mr Holliday for counts 2 to 5.  Although this basis did not reflect the 
framing  of  the  counts  in  the  indictment,  Mr Holliday  did  not  object  to  the 
indictment, or raise any complaint about the way the indictment was framed.   

 
In closing submissions, the prosecutor put the question to the jury in this 
way:    ""Did  [Mr  Holliday]  urge  [Mr  Powell]  to  procure  others""  to  commit  the 
offence of kidnapping?  The prosecutor explained that the  mechanism by which 
Mr  Holliday  intended  to  ""derail[]""  his  prosecution  ""was  to  urge  [Mr  Powell]  to 
organise the two [witnesses] to be kidnapped"". 

 
In  directing  the  jury  on  counts  4  and  5,  the  trial  judge  said  that 
""the evidence  ...  was  to  the  effect  that  [Mr  Holliday]  urged  [Mr Powell]  not  to 
personally  kidnap  [each  witness]  but  to  arrange  for  a  third  party  to  do  so"".  
His Honour continued:   

""[A]s  I  have  said,  it  does  not  appear  to  me  to  be  any  part  of  the 
[prosecution]  case  that  [Mr  Holliday]  intentionally  urged  [Mr  Powell] 
personally  to  undertake  either  of  the  kidnappings  that  are  referred  to  in 
counts  4  and  5.    ...    [T]he  law  in  this  Territory  is  that  a  person  who 
procures  the  commission  of  [an]  offence  is  taken  to  have  committed  the 
offence themselves."" 

 
In particular, the jury was directed that the prosecution had to prove that:  
(1)  ""[Mr  Holliday]  intentionally  urged  [Mr Powell]  to  procure  a  third  party  to 
kidnap"" each witness; and (2) ""he did so intending"" that each witness ""should be 
kidnapped"". 

 
It is apparent that the trial judge's reference to the ""law in this Territory"" 
was  intended  to  invoke  s 45(1)  of  the  Criminal  Code.    However,  at  no  point 
during  the  directions  was  s 45(1)  referred  to  or  were  further  directions  given 
about how s 45(1) might relate to counts 2 to 5.

Court of Appeal's decision 

4. 

18 

 
The  Court  of  Appeal  plainly  understood  s 45  to  be  central  to  the 
prosecution  case  at  trial.    Referring  to  the  no  case  application,  Murrell CJ  said 
that2: 

""[Mr  Holliday]  submitted  that  there  was  no  case  to  answer  on  the 
incitement  counts  because  the  law  does  not  recognise  an  offence  of 
inciting  another  to  procure  an  offence  where  the  latter  offence  is  not 
committed.  

The prosecution response was that, if Mr Powell had procured the 
kidnappings,  then  he  would  be  'taken  to  have  committed'  the  substantive 
offences  of  kidnapping  and  murder,  despite  the  fact  that  the  substantive 
offences were to be committed by procurement. 

The trial judge acknowledged that the submission raised a difficult 
question, but found that there was a case to answer.  Detailed reasons were 
not given."" 

19 

20 

 
Murrell  CJ's  understanding  of  the  prosecution  case  was  shared  by 
Wigney J,  who  stated  that  the  prosecution  case  was  that  ""Mr Holliday  urged 
Mr Powell  to  commit  the  crime  of  kidnapping  by  operation  of  s 45  of  the 
Criminal  Code""3.    Wigney  J  also  noted  that  the  prosecution  case  statement 
""referred  to  s 45  of  the  Criminal  Code  in  addressing  the  elements  of  the 
incitement counts""4. 

 
It was against that background that Wigney J identified the central issue as 
being  ""whether  the  offence  of  inciting  someone  to  procure  a  third  person  to 
commit an offence is an offence known to the law""5.  Murrell CJ also considered 
this as the central issue but in a more qualified manner – whether it is an offence 
known to law when the person incited does not procure the offence.

concluded that, ""at least when no substantive offence occurs, a person cannot be 
convicted  of  incitement on the basis  that they  incited another  to procure  a  third 
person to commit a substantive offence""6.  Although her Honour did not consider 
it necessary to finally decide whether the same is true if a substantive offence is 
committed  (given  that  none  was  in  this  case),  her  Honour's  reasoning  suggests 
that the same would be true in those circumstances.   

Wigney J disagreed with her Honour's conclusion, holding that if a person 
 
""urges someone to procure a third person to commit an offence ... the person can 
be charged  with inciting the commission of that offence""7.  Refshauge J did not 
decide  the  issue.    Wigney J,  with  whom  Refshauge J  agreed  in  this  respect, 
allowed the appeal in relation to counts 4 and 5 on the basis that ss 45(2)(a) and 
45(3)  of  the  Criminal  Code  –  which  together  provide  that  a  person  is  taken  to 
have committed the substantive offence only if the person's conduct in fact aids, 
abets,  counsels  or  procures  the  commission  of  the  offence  by  the  other  person 
and  the  other  person  commits  the  offence  –  are  ""limitation[s]  or  qualifying 
provision[s]"" within the meaning of s 47(5).  The requirement that the substantive 
offence  be  committed  therefore  applied  to  the  offence  of  incitement.    That led 
Wigney J  to  conclude  that  ""[b]ecause  Mr Powell  did  not  successfully  procure 
anyone  to  kidnap,  and  nobody  was  kidnapped,  not  only  did  Mr  Powell  not 
commit  an  offence,  but  Mr  Holliday  also  could  not  be  convicted  of  inciting 
Mr Powell""8. 

 
Although  Murrell  CJ  and  Wigney  J  reasoned  differently,  they  each 
concluded  that  the  convictions  on  counts  4  and  5  were  to  be  quashed  and  each 
considered  the  fact  that  no  substantive  offence  had  been  committed  to  be 
important to that conclusion.

Section 47, titled ""Incitement"", was the offence charged in counts 2 to 5.  

 
It relevantly provides that: 

""(1) 

If  a  person  urges  the  commission  of  an  offence  (the offence 
incited), the person commits the offence of incitement. 

... 

(2)  However, the person commits the offence of incitement only if the 

person intends that the offence incited be committed. 

... 

(4)   A  person  may  be  found  guilty  of  the  offence  of  incitement  even 

though it was impossible to commit the offence incited. 

(5)  Any  defence,  procedure, 

limitation  or  qualifying  provision 
applying  to  an  offence  applies  to  the  offence  of  incitement  in 
relation to the offence. 

(6) 

This  section  does  not  apply  to  an  offence  against  section  44 
(Attempt),  section  48  (Conspiracy)  or  this  section.""    (emphasis 
added) 

26 

27 

 
Section  47(1)  extends  criminal  responsibility  by  providing  that  a  person 
commits  the  discrete  offence  of  ""incitement""  if  that  person  ""urges  the 
commission of an offence"" (emphasis added). 

 
The  physical  element  of  s 47(1)  is  conduct:    that  the  person  urges  the 
commission  of  an  offence.    Under  the  Criminal  Code,  the fault  element  that 
applies  to  conduct  is  intention11:    the person  commits  the  offence  of  incitement 
only if the person intentionally urges the commission of an offence.

this kind in Pt 2.4.

Further,  the  person  will  commit  the  offence  of  incitement  only  if  the 
 
person  intends  that  the  offence  incited  be  committed.    However,  it  is  not 
necessary that the offence incited be completed.  Moreover, as s 47(4) provides, 
impossibility is not a defence.   

As  the  prosecution  submitted,  to  prove  the  offence  of  incitement  the 

 
prosecution must establish that: 

(1) 

(2) 

(3) 

a  person  ""urge[d]""  some  conduct,  namely  ""the  commission  of 
an offence""12; 

the person intentionally urged the conduct13; 

the  conduct  that  was  urged  would  amount  to  the  commission  of 
an offence; and 

(4) 

the person intended that the offence incited be committed14.   

It can be accepted that a person can be found guilty of incitement if they 
 
either urge a particular person to commit an offence or urge the commission of an 
offence  generally.    In  either  case,  once  the  urging  is  done,  the  offence  of 
incitement is complete15.   

 
Each of ss 44, 47 and 48 creates a discrete offence which is phrased ""[i]f a 
person  [does X],  the  person  commits  the  offence  of [X]"";  provides  that 
impossibility  is  not  a  defence16;  and  provides  that  ""any  defence,  procedure, 
limitation  or  qualifying  provision""  that  applies  to  the  substantive  offence  also

The  other  provisions  in  Pt 2.4  are  concerned  with  modes  of  proof18  – 
 
complicity  and  common  purpose  (s 45)  and  agency  (s 46).    And,  in  particular,

Section  45(1)  provides  that  a  person  is  ""taken  to  have  committed"" 
an offence if the person ""aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of the 
offence  by  someone  else""  (emphasis  added).    In  those  specified  circumstances, 
it extends criminal responsibility for a substantive offence20.  The ""offence"" that a 
person  is  taken  to  have  committed  is  the  ""offence""  the  commission  of  which, 
by the other person, is aided, abetted, counselled or procured (ie, the substantive 
offence).    There is  no  discrete  offence  of  aiding,  abetting,  counselling  or 
procuring.   

 
This  construction  –  which  follows  from  the  words  used  in  s 45(1)  – 
is supported  by  s 45(2),  which  provides  that  the  person  ""commits  the  offence"" 
because  of  s 45  only  if  certain  conditions  are  met,  including  that  the  person's 
conduct ""in fact aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of the offence 
by the other person""21, and by s 45(3), which provides that ""the person is taken to 
have committed the offence only if the other person commits the offence"".   

 
Section  45  has  no  operation  until  the  substantive  offence  has  been 
completed.  And, once the substantive offence has been completed, s 45 does not 
create  a  discrete  offence  of  aiding,  abetting,  counselling  or  procuring.    Instead, 
by reason of s 45, the person is liable to be charged with the substantive offence. 

 
There  are  some  aspects  of  s 45  that  might  be  thought  to  support  the 
conclusion  that  the  provision  creates  a  discrete  offence.    For example,  s 45(4)

refers to ""the offence of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the commission 
of the offence"" (emphasis added) and ss 45(5) and 45(6) refer to a person being 
found  guilty  (or  not)  of  ""aiding,  abetting,  counselling  or  procuring  the 
commission  of  an  offence"".    However,  as  a  matter  of  statutory  construction, 
these provisions  should  be  understood  as  secondary  to  s 45(1),  which  must  be 
treated as the leading provision in s 45.  It is s 45(1) that operates to provide that 
a person is ""taken to have committed"" an offence in the circumstances specified.  
The balance of s 45 then explains and circumscribes the scope of the liability for 
which  s 45(1)  provides.    Elevating  the  importance  of  s 45(4),  (5)  and  (6)  would 
ignore  the  primacy  of  s 45(1),  which  does  not  create  a  discrete  offence, 
in contradistinction to those provisions in Pt 2.4 that do create discrete offences. 

 
That result is neither novel nor surprising.  It must be recalled that Isaacs J 
in Walsh v Sainsbury22, when considering the interaction between the incitement 
and  procurement  provisions  in  the  Crimes  Act  1914  (Cth)  (which  were  in 
somewhat  different  terms  from  ss 47  and  45),  stated  that  the  procurement 
provision in that Act (being s 5) did not create a new and substantive offence and 
did not operate until the substantive offence had been committed.   It was, in his 
Honour's view, only when the offence had been committed that the procurement 
provision  operated  to  make  any  person  falling  within  its  terms  a  principal 
participating in the substantive offence. 

Incitement to procure an offence under the Criminal Code? 

 
The  principal  question  in  this  appeal  is  whether  the  Criminal Code 
provides  that Person A is guilty of committing the offence of incitement if they 
urge Person B (or persons generally) to procure Person C to commit an offence.   

 
As identified at the start of these reasons, the key statutory question under 
s 47  of  the  Criminal  Code  is  whether  the  conduct  (or course  of  conduct)  urged, 
if acted  upon  as  the  inciter  intended,  would  amount  to  the  commission  of  an 
offence.    That  is,  the  question  is  whether  the  conduct  that  was  incited, 
when completed,  would  amount  to  the  commission  of  an  offence  by  the  person 
incited, and, if so, what offence.   

The  prosecution  identified  the  conduct  incited  as  the  procurement  of  the 
 
  So identified,  that  conduct 
commission  of  the  offence  of  kidnapping. 
(the procuring), when completed by Mr Powell, would not of itself amount to the 
commission  of  an  offence  under  s 45  of  the  Criminal  Code.    Procurement  of  a

substantive  offence  is  not  a  discrete  offence  which  exists  separately  from  the 
substantive offence.  

11. 

 
Put another way, procurement is addressed in s 45 of the Criminal  Code, 
but s 45 does not create a discrete offence23.  Thus, there is no offence under s 45 
to which s 47 can attach.   

Moreover, no implication that s 47(1) can operate upon s 45(1) should be 
 
drawn from the absence of a reference to s 45 in s 47(6).  As seen above, s 47(6) 
provides  that  ""[t]his  section  does  not  apply  to  an  offence  against  section  44 
(Attempt),  section 48  (Conspiracy)  or  this  section"".    The  natural  reading  of 
s 47(6) is that s 47 does not apply to s 47:  there is no offence of inciting to incite 
the  commission  of  an  offence.    Nor  are  there  offences  of  inciting  an  attempt  or 
inciting  a  conspiracy.    In  other  words,  s 47(6)  carves  out  extension  provisions 
from  the  scope  of  s 47(1).    But  it  only  carves  out  those  provisions  that  create 
discrete offences.  Because s 45(1) does not create an ""offence"", there is no need 
for it to be carved out in the same way.   

Reference also should  be made to s 44(10).   Section 44(10) provides that 
 
s 44 (dealing with attempts) ""does not apply  to an offence against section 45  or 
section 48 (Conspiracy)"".  There are a  number of things  that should be noticed.  
When  referring  to  the  discrete  offence  created  by  s 48,  s 44(10)  identifies  the 
offence  as  ""Conspiracy"".    In  contrast,  when  the  provision  refers  to  s 45,  which 
does  not  create  a  discrete  offence,  it  does  not  name  the  offence.    The  fact  that, 
in the  context  of  the  attempt  offence  created  by  s 44,  s 44(10)  uses  the  phrase 
""an offence  against  section 45""  is  not  determinative  of  the  interaction  (if  any) 
between  ss 47  and 45.    Section  44(10)  does  not  provide  a  sufficient  basis  for 
construing s 45 so that it creates, or is to be treated as creating, a discrete offence 
to which s 47(1) can attach. 

 
The  conclusion  that  s 47(1)  cannot  operate  by  reference  to  s 45(1)  is  not 
undermined by observing, as Wigney J did, that it would be ""a very strange result 
indeed  if  a  person  who  incited  someone  to  procure  a  third  person  to  commit  an 
offence would escape liability even in circumstances where the person urged or 
incited  successfully  procured  the  third  person  to  commit  the  substantive 
offence""24.    That  observation  ignores  the  other  ways  in  which  criminal 
responsibility might attach to a person in that position under Pt 2.4.  For example, 
assuming  that  Mr Holliday's  plan  had  come  to  fruition,  s 45(1)  might  have 
operated  on  Mr  Holliday  himself  on  the  basis  that  his  conduct  aided,  abetted,

counselled  or  procured  the  commission  of  the  kidnapping.    Or,  if  Mr Holliday 
and Mr Powell had entered into an agreement, it may have been open to charge 
Mr Holliday with conspiracy25.   

And,  of  course,  under  the  Criminal  Code,  there  is  nothing  to  preclude  a 
 
distinct  offence  of  attempting 
incitement.  
So, for example,  where  a  communication  amounting  to  an  incitement  did  not 
reach the intended recipient of the communication26, that would be an offence of 
attempting to incite.    

the  offence  of 

to  commit 

The  legislative  history  of  the  Criminal  Code  (Cth)27,  upon  which  the 
 
Criminal Code was based, demonstrates that, although there was early discussion 
about  the  need  for  an  offence  of  incitement  to  procure  to  be  included,  no  such 
offence was in fact included.  

In  1990, 

the  Gibbs  Committee,  established 

 
to  review 
Commonwealth  criminal  laws  as  part  of  a  project  to  develop  an  Australian 
criminal code, recommended that ""it should be made clear that it is an offence to 
incite  a  person  to  assist,  encourage  or  procure  another  person  to  commit  an 
offence""28.    This recommendation  was  made  in  light  of  the  observation  by  the 
England and Wales Law Commission that29: 

in  1987 

""it  appears  that  the  incitement  of  another  to  aid,  abet,  counsel  or  procure 
(in  other  words,  to  make  himself  an  accessory  to)  the  commission  of  an 
offence by a third person is not an offence known to the law.  The reason 
for  this  is  that  aiding  and  abetting  is  not  in  itself  an  offence.    It  attracts

However, as the Gibbs Committee recognised, ""it is possible to conceive 
 
of circumstances where a person is incited to take steps  of an active or positive 
nature  to  assist  or  facilitate  the  commission  by  another  of  an  offence""30.  
The Committee  went  on  to  state  that  ""the  technical  ground  put  forward  by  the 
Law Commission that these steps would not represent an offence until taken does 
not  seem  sufficient  reason  to  refrain  from  making  such  incitement  subject  to 
criminal sanction""31.   

 
It  was  therefore  unsurprising  that  the  Draft  Bill  annexed  to  the  Report 
prepared by the Gibbs Committee specifically included a provision that provided 
that,  for the  purpose  of  incitement,  ""offence""  included  an  offence  under  what 
ultimately became the Commonwealth equivalent of s 45 of the Criminal Code32.   

 
However, neither the Discussion Draft nor the Final Report of the Model 
Criminal Code Officers Committee (""the MCCOC"")33 – established following the 
release  of  the  Gibbs  Committee  Report  –  addressed,  when  dealing  with  the 
general principles of criminal responsibility, the issue of whether the incitement 
offence  could  operate  upon  the  provision  dealing  with  aiding,  abetting, 
counselling or procuring.  Nor was a provision akin to the one recommended by 
the Gibbs Committee included in the Criminal Code (Cth) as enacted.   

 
In  circumstances  where,  at  best,  it  was  uncertain  whether  there  was  a 
common  law  offence  of  incitement  to  procure  and,  at  worst,  there  was  no  such 
offence34, one might reasonably expect that, if the drafters had intended that the 
Criminal  Code  (Cth)  include  an  offence  of  incitement  to  procure,  they  would 
have expressly provided for one, as suggested by the Gibbs Committee.

In  the  Court  of  Appeal,  Wigney J  suggested  that  the  Gibbs Committee's 
recommendation  may  not  have  been  taken  up  ""for  any  number  of  reasons,

including  that  it  was  not  considered  that  such  a  clarification  was  necessary""35.  
It is not useful to speculate.  It is sufficient to observe that, given the legislative 
history  and  the  fact  that  the  express  terms  of  s 45(1)  provide  that  it  does  not 
create a discrete offence, if incitement to procure were to be an offence under the 
Criminal Code, one would have expected it to have been expressly dealt with.   

Relationship between incitement to incite and incitement to procure 

54 

55 

 
As  the  prosecution  recognised  on  appeal  to  this  Court,  the concepts  of 
incitement  and  procurement  have  the  potential  to  overlap.    For  that  reason,  it  is 
relevant  to  consider  the  Criminal  Code's  treatment  of  ""incitement  to  incite"".  
As noted  above,  because  of  s 47(6),  there  is  no  offence  of  incitement  to  incite.  
It is useful to consider the legislative history that led to that position. 

 
The  Gibbs  Committee  did  not  recommend  creating  an  offence  of 
incitement to incite the commission of an offence36.  The Committee ""doubt[ed] 
the  need  for  such  an  offence""37,  although  this  was  in  the  context  of  it 
recommending  that  there  be  an  offence  of  inciting  a  person  to  be  ""knowingly 
involved  in""  an  offence38.    In  the  event,  the  Criminal  Code  (Cth)  adopted  the 
language  of  aiding,  abetting,  counselling  or  procuring  rather  than  knowing 
involvement.  And as noted above, no express provision was made for an offence 
of incitement to aid, abet, counsel or procure. 

56 

 
In  the  MCCOC  Discussion  Draft,  the  draft  incitement  provision  read:  
""[t]his section does not apply to an offence under section 401 (attempt), [section] 
405  (conspiracy)  or  this  section  (incitement)""39.    Then, in the  MCCOC  Final

Report, the draft incitement provision no longer included the word ""(incitement)"" 
after ""this section""40.  However, the MCCOC stated that it had decided that41: 

15. 

""it  should  not  be  possible  to  be  guilty  of  inciting  to  incite,  inciting  to 
conspire, or inciting to attempt.  There has to be some limit on preliminary 
offences.    This  follows  the  position  taken  by  the  Gibbs  Committee 
(paras 18.41-18.46) 
the  English  Law 
Commission.  The Gibbs Committee did not think it necessary to include a 
provision to achieve the abolition of incitement to incite in its Bill (s 7B).

That  passage  from  the  Final  Report  was  included,  in  relevantly  identical 
terms, in the Explanatory Memorandum to the Criminal Code Bill 1994 (Cth)42,

quoted  in  full  in  the  Explanatory  Memorandum  to  the  Bill  for  the  Criminal

The contrary view of the England and Wales Law Commission expressed 
 
in 1989 – that an offence of incitement to incite should not be excluded – was in 
part due to the fact that the offence had recently been stated to exist at common 
law  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  of  England  and  Wales44.    The  Law  Commission 
considered  that  ""[i]t would  not  be  right"",  within  the  scope  of  the  project  it  was

undertaking  at  the  time,  ""to  attempt  to  overturn  the  recent  decisions""  and  that 
""[s]uch a course would require much fuller discussion and consultation""45. 

16. 

 
In this context, it is relevant to note that the Law Commission was alive to 
the  apparent  tension  between  retaining  an  offence  of  ""inciting  to  incite""  but  not 
creating an offence of ""inciting to procure""46.   The Law Commission  noted that 
taking  that  course  ""embodies  a  distinction  that  might  be  thought  by  some  to  be 
purely technical""47.  The Law Commission observed that the reason that it is not 
an offence to incite another person to procure the commission of an offence by a 
third person is that procuring an offence48: 

""is not in itself an offence.  It attracts liability only on the commission of 
the substantive offence.  Until that offence is committed the incitement is 
only to do acts which may or may not turn out to be criminal.  The logic of 
this  rule  ...  has  been  undercut  to  some  extent  by  the  decisions  that 
incitement to incite is an offence known to the law."" 

This legislative history reveals that the drafters of the Criminal Code (Cth) 
 
intended to expressly exclude an offence of incitement to incite.  They can also 
be  taken  to  have  been  aware  of  the  postulated  need  to  make  provision  for  an 
offence of incitement to procure, as suggested by the Gibbs Committee.  Against 
that  background,  it  is  unlikely  that  the  failure  to  include  such  a  provision  was 
inadvertent.  And by not including either of those offences in the Criminal Code 
(Cth),  the drafters  avoided  the  tension,  noted  by  the  England  and  Wales  Law 
Commission, created by having one offence and not the other. 

 
The prosecution's contention that, as ""a matter of evidence"", a person can 
be  found  guilty  of  inciting  the  commission  of  an  offence  if  they  incite  another 
person  to  procure  a  third  person  to  commit  that  offence  would  permit  the 
prosecution  to  circumvent  s 47(6)  and  would  potentially  undermine  the 
legislative  choice  not  to  make  procurement  a  discrete  offence.    In  substance,

it would  permit  a  person  to  be  convicted  for  conduct  that  would  in  many  cases 
amount  to  no  more  than  incitement  to  incite.    Such  a  conviction  would  be 
contrary to the express terms of s 47 and inconsistent with the legislative history 
of the Criminal Code and its Commonwealth progenitor.   

that,  although 

The  prosecution  further  contended 

 
incitement  and 
procurement  overlap,  they  target  different  conduct,  in  that  the  former  would 
normally  be  charged  only  where  there  had  been  no  completed  offence.  
In particular,  the  prosecution  contended  that  if  a  person  is  urged  to  urge  the 
commission  of  an  offence,  they  are  not  being  urged  to  take  active  steps  that 
might result in them being found guilty of the substantive offence.  Instead, they 
are  merely  being  urged  to  undertake  further  urging,  which  is  a  step  further 
removed 
the  ultimate  commission  of  any  substantive  offence.  
The remoteness of that urging from the substantive offence is reflected in the less 
serious penalties for incitement under s 47(1).   

from 

 
That contention is contrary to the legislative scheme of the Criminal Code.  
Under  the  Criminal  Code,  there  is  no  offence  of  incitement  to  incite49, 
and procurement (s 45) is not a discrete offence.  The legislative intention is not 
to  capture  conduct  that  amounts  to  either  incitement  to  incite  or  incitement  to 
procure.    Put another  way,  the  existence  of  an  offence  of  incitement  to  procure 
would ""undercut"" the logic of the express exclusion of incitement to incite under 
s 47(6). 

Limitation or qualifying provision 

 
Once  it  is  accepted  that  s 45(1)  does  not  create  an  offence  on  which 
s 47(1) can operate, the issue of whether ss 45(2)(a) and 45(3) are ""limitation[s] 
or  qualifying  provision[s]""  within  the  meaning  of  s 47(5)  does  not  arise.  
Section 47(5)  provides  that  ""[a]ny  defence,  procedure,  limitation  or  qualifying 
provision applying to  an offence applies to the offence of incitement in relation 
to the offence"".  It is plain that the reference to ""an offence"" in this provision is to 
the  substantive  offence  that  is  the  subject  of  s 47(1).    Because  the  prosecution 
could  not  rely  upon  s 45(1)  as  creating  that  offence,  the question  about 
ss 45(2)(a) and 45(3) is not reached.

GAGELER J.   I agree with Kiefel CJ, Bell and Gordon JJ that the appeal must 
be dismissed because s 47(1) of the Criminal Code is not engaged.  

18. 

 
The  critical  question  for  the  purpose  of  s  47(1),  as  I  see  it,  is  whether 
Mr Powell  would  have  been  taken  by  s  45(1)  to  have  committed  the  offence  of 
kidnapping had Mr Powell done what the jury must have found that Mr Holliday 
urged  him  to  do  so  as  to  have  arranged  for  another  person  to  kidnap  a  witness.  
The answer compelled by s  45(3)  is that, unless that other  person actually went 
on to kidnap a witness, Mr Powell could not have been taken by s 45(1) to have 
committed that offence by procuring it.  

 
Odd as it might seem at first blush, that outcome is not incomprehensible 
having  regard  to  policy  choices  embedded  within  the  scheme  of  Pt  2.4  of  the 
Criminal  Code.    If  there  is  no  offence  of  incitement  to  incite  an  offence  (as 
s 47(6)  says  there  is  not),  but  if  there  is  an  offence  of  incitement  to  procure  an 
offence (as s 47(6) leaves open), and if procurement cannot be an offence unless 
and  until  the  procured  offence  is  committed  (as  s  45(3)  makes  clear),  it  is 
unsurprising  that  incitement  to  procure  an  offence  should  not  be  an  offence 
unless  and  until  the  offence  is  procured  and  committed.    Without  the  added 
requirement  that  the  offence  incited  to  be  procured  actually  be  procured  and 
committed, the distinction between the known offence of inciting to procure and 
the unknown offence of inciting to incite would be so fine as to be illusory. 

The  outcome  is  even  less  surprising  against  the  background  of  Walsh  v 
 
Sainsbury50, which relevantly concerned the relationship between ss 5 and 7A of 
the  Crimes  Act  1914  (Cth).    Section  5  provided  that  ""[a]ny  person  who  aids, 
abets,  counsels,  or  procures,  or  by  act  or  omission  is  in  any  way  directly  or 
indirectly  knowingly  concerned  in,  or  party  to,  the  commission  of  any  offence 
against  this  Act  or  any  other  Act  ...  shall  be  deemed  to  have  committed  that 
offence  and  shall  be  punishable  accordingly"".    Section  5  was  an  ""aiding  and 
abetting  section""  which  could  apply  ""only  where  what  has  been  called  the 
principal  offence  [had]  been  committed""51.    Section  7A  made  it  an  offence  to 
""incite"" the commission of an offence against a law of the Commonwealth.   

The  clearly  expressed  view  of  Isaacs  J  in  Walsh  v  Sainsbury  was  that 
 
Mr Walsh could not be convicted of having ""incited"" another person (Mr O'Neill) 
(within  the  meaning  of  s  7A)  to  ""counsel""  (within  the  meaning  of  s  5)  the 
Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia to strike (contrary to another law of 
the Commonwealth) in the absence of proof of ""the fact of an actual strike of the

NETTLE  J.      The  issue  in  this  appeal  is  whether  it  is  sufficient  to  constitute  an 
offence of incitement  contrary to s 47 of the Criminal Code 2002 (ACT) for an 
accused  (""the  incitor"")  to  urge  another  person  (""the  incitee"")  to  procure  a  third 
person to commit an offence against the Criminal Code (the ""principal offence"") 
in circumstances where, despite the incitor's urging, the incitee does not procure 
the third person to commit the principal offence.  The facts of the matter and the 
relevant provisions of the Criminal Code are sufficiently stated in the reasons for 
judgment of Kiefel CJ, Bell and Gordon JJ and there is no need to repeat them. 

In substance, s 47(1) of the Criminal Code provides that, if a person urges 
 
the  commission  of  ""an  offence"",  the  person  commits  an  offence  of  incitement.  
Thus,  consistently  with  the  position  that  pertained  at  common  law53  and  under 
s 7A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth)54, which s 47 of the Criminal Code replaced55, 
in order to constitute an offence of incitement under s 47(1), what is incited must 
be ""an offence"".  The  Crown alleged that the respondent (""Holliday"") urged the 
commission  of  an  offence  by  another  person  (""Powell"").    The  offence  which  it 
was  contended  that  Holliday  had  urged  Powell  to  commit  was  an  offence 
contrary  to  s  45  of  the  Criminal  Code,  namely,  procuring  a  third  person  to 
commit  offences  of  kidnapping  and  the  suborning  of  persons  proposed  to  be 
called as witnesses in Holliday's then forthcoming trial for child sex offences.  As 
will  be  explained,  that  contention  was  ill-founded.    Section  45  of  the  Criminal 
Code does not create an offence of procuring the commission of an offence by a 
third person. 

In  form  and  substance,  s  45  of  the  Criminal  Code  is  similar  to  earlier 
 
iterations of what Isaacs J described in Walsh v Sainsbury56 as ""merely an 'aiding 
and abetting' section"".  His Honour was there speaking of s 5 of the Crimes Act

""Any person who aids, abets, counsels, or procures, or by act or omission 
is  in  any  way  directly  or  indirectly  knowingly  concerned  in,  or  party  to, 
the commission of any offence against this Act or any other Act ... shall be 
deemed  to  have  committed  that  offence  and  shall  be  punishable 
accordingly."" 

Section 87 was as follows: 

""Every  person  who,  or  organization  which,  is  directly  or  indirectly 
concerned in the commission of any offence against this Act, or counsels 
takes part in or encourages the commission of any  such offence, shall be 
deemed  to  have  committed  that  offence  and  shall  be  punishable 
accordingly."" 

Isaacs  J  considered58  that  neither  provision  operated  until  and  unless  a 
 
principal offence was committed and that, even then, neither provision created an 
offence.  Rather, when and if a principal offence was committed, each provision 
operated so as to deem a person who had counselled or procured the commission 
of  that  principal  offence  to  be  a  principal  participant  in  the  principal  offence.  
Thus, with respect to s 5, Isaacs J stated59:  

""That  section,  construed  in  accordance  with  a  long-continued  and 
consistent judicial and legislative view, is merely an 'aiding and abetting' 
section.  It creates no new offence.  It does not operate unless and until the 
'offence'    which  may  be  called,  for  convenience,  the  principal  offence, 
though  it  really  is  the  only  substantive  offence    has  been  committed.  
Then, and then only, does the section operate to make any person falling 
within the terms of the section a principal participating in that offence."" 

Similarly, with respect to s 87, his Honour observed60:  

""I am unable to discern any  distinction  between the effect of  [s] 5  above 
quoted  and  [s]  87  now  in  hand.    In  each  there  is  supposed  to  be  an 
'offence' committed and the section deems any person answering the given 
description  'to  have  committed  that  offence,'  and  to  be  punishable 
'accordingly,'  that  is,  as  having  actually  as  a  principal  committed  the 
offence.  It does not create a new and substantive offence.  It does not say, 
for instance, that a person who 'counsels' or 'encourages' a person to lock 
out his workmen is deemed to have locked out the workmen even though

the  employer  has  refused  to  accept  the  counsel  or  yield  to  the 
encouragement.    No  special  penalty  is  provided  for  the  offence  of 
counselling  or  encouraging  apart  from  the  punishment  for  actually 
committing the offence."" 

Isaacs  J  concluded61  accordingly  that  a  person  could  not  be  convicted  of 
 
an  offence  of  unlawfully  inciting  a  person  to  counsel  a  union  to  undertake  an 
illegal  strike  contrary  to  s 7A  of  the  Crimes  Act  until  and  unless  the  unlawful 
strike was undertaken.   

Section 45(1) of the Criminal Code is, in relevant substance, the same as 
 
s 5  of  the  Crimes  Act  and s  87  of  the  Commonwealth  Conciliation  and 
Arbitration  Act,  and  s 47(1)  of  the  Criminal  Code  is,  in  relevant  respects, 
identical  to  s 7A  of  the  Crimes  Act.    There  is  little  reason  to  doubt  that  they 
operate  in  a  similar  fashion.    Like  s 5  of  the  Crimes  Act  and s  87  of  the 
Commonwealth  Conciliation  and  Arbitration  Act,  s 45(1)  of  the  Criminal  Code 
has  no  effect  in  terms  until  and  unless  a  principal  offence  has  been  committed.  
And like s 5 of the Crimes Act and s 87 of the Commonwealth Conciliation and 
Arbitration  Act,  s 45(1)  of  the  Criminal  Code  does  not  create  a  new  offence.  
Instead, when and if a principal offence is committed, s 45(1) has the effect that a 
person who has counselled or procured the commission of the principal offence 
""is taken to have committed"" (scil ""is deemed to have committed"") the principal 
offence.  Sub-sections (2) and (3) of s 45 explicitly confirm that.   

To  the  contrary,  it  was  observed  in  the  Court  below62  that,  because 
 
sub-ss (4), (5) and (6) of s 45 speak in terms  of ""the offence of aiding, abetting, 
counselling or procuring the commission of the [principal] offence"", or a person 
being  guilty  of  such  an  offence,  unlike  s 5  of  the  Crimes  Act  and s  87  of  the 
Commonwealth  Conciliation  and  Arbitration  Act,  s  45  relevantly  creates  an 
offence:  an offence of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the commission 
of the principal offence.   

 
At  first  sight,  that  presents  as  an  attractive  proposition.    But  it  does  not 
withstand closer analysis.  As is apparent from s 45(1), (2) and (3)  those being 
the  sub-sections  principally  concerned  with 
imposition  of  criminal 
liability  the  operative  effect  of  s 45  is  to  subject  a  person  who  aids,  abets, 
counsels or procures the commission of a principal offence to being taken to have 
committed the principal offence.  That operation is reinforced by  the references 
in  s 45(7)  to  a  ""person  ...  taken  to  have  committed  an  offence  because  of  this 
section""  being  liable  to  punishment  ""as  if,  apart  from  the  operation  of  this 
section,  the  person  had  committed  the  offence""  (emphasis  added).    As  appears

from  s 45(1),  (2)  and  (3),  the  only  offence  which  a  person  is  ""taken  to  have 
committed""  because  of  s 45  is  the  principal  offence,  not  an  offence  of  aiding, 
abetting, counselling or procuring the principal offence contrary to s 45.  Equally, 
as is apparent from s 45(7), the only penalty to which a person may be subjected 
by  reason  of  s 45  is  the  penalty  applicable  to  the  principal  offence  when  and  if 
the principal offence is committed, and even then only because the person is, by 
reason of having aided, abetted, counselled or procured its commission, ""taken to 
have committed"" the principal offence.  There is also the reference in s 45(8) to a 
""trier  of fact  [being]  satisfied  ...  that  a  defendant  committed  an  offence  because 
of this section or otherwise"".  In that context, ""an offence because of this section"" 
can only mean the principal offence which a person is ""taken to have committed"" 
because of s 45.   

 
Thus,  read  in  context,  and  especially  in  light  of  s 45(1),  (2),  (3),  (7) 
and (8), the expression in s 45(4) ""the offence of aiding, abetting, counselling or 
procuring the commission of the [principal] offence"" presents not as creating or 
recognising  the  existence  of  an  offence  of  aiding,  abetting,  counselling  or 
procuring  the  commission  of  the  principal  offence,  but  rather  as  an  epithetical, 
compendious descriptor of the criminal liability of a person who, by operation of 
s 45(1),  is  ""taken  to  have  committed""  the  principal  offence  by  reason  of  having 
aided, abetted, counselled or procured its commission.  Similarly, the stipulation 
that  a  person  ""must  not  be  found  guilty  of  aiding,  abetting,  counselling  or 
procuring  the  commission  of  [the  principal]  offence""  in  s  45(5)  is  to  be 
understood  not  as  creating  or  recognising  the  existence  of  an  offence  of  aiding, 
abetting,  counselling  or  procuring  the  commission  of  the  principal  offence,  but 
rather as a similarly epithetical, compendious means of stipulating that a person 
must not be found guilty of having committed the principal offence by reason of 
having aided, abetted, counselled or procured its commission if the person ended 
his or her involvement and took all reasonable steps to prevent the commission of 
the principal offence.  And, likewise in context, it is apparent that the stipulation 
in s 45(6) that a person ""may be found guilty of aiding, abetting, counselling or 
procuring the commission of [the principal] offence"" is designed to convey that a 
person may be found guilty of having committed the principal offence, by reason 
of having aided, abetted, counselled or procured its commission, notwithstanding 
that  the  principal  in  the  first  degree  is  not  prosecuted  for  or  found  guilty  of  the 
principal offence.   

 
None of this suggests  that s 45 creates a new offence of aiding, abetting, 
counselling  or  procuring  the  commission  of  a  principal  offence,  as  opposed  to 
deeming  a  person  who  aids,  abets,  counsels  or  procures  the  commission  of  a 
principal  offence  to  have  committed  the  principal  offence,  when  and  if  it  is 
committed.    

 
Perhaps  it  could  be  argued  that,  because  s  45(4)  employs  the  expression 
""the offence of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the commission of the 
offence""  as  a  means  of  describing  the  criminal  liability  of  a  person  who,  by

reason of s 45(1), is taken to have committed the principal offence, the reference 
to  ""an  offence""  in  s 47(1)  should  equally  be  understood  as  picking  up  and 
including the criminal liability of a person who, by operation of s 45(1), is taken 
to  have  committed  the  principal  offence.    On  that  construction,  it  would  be 
sufficient to constitute an offence of incitement under s 47(1) for a person to urge 
another to aid, abet, counsel or procure the commission of the principal offence; 
and,  because  an  offence  of  incitement  is  complete  upon  the  act  of  urging63, 
Holliday  would  be  liable  to  be  convicted  of  inciting  Powell  to  procure  the 
commission  of  the  kidnapping  and  subornation  of  the  witnesses  via  a  third 
person, despite Powell not having done so. 

 
The difficulty with that argument, however, is that where s 45(4) employs 
the  expression  ""the  offence  of  aiding,  abetting,  counselling  or  procuring  the 
commission  of  the  offence""  as  a  means  of  describing  the  criminal  liability  of  a 
person who is taken to have committed the principal offence, it does so in order 
to describe a species of accessorial criminal liability which has arisen by reason 
that  the  principal  offence  has  been  committed.    The  use  of  the  present  perfect 
""taken  to  have  committed""  in  s  45(1),  (3)  and  (7)  is  calculated  to  achieve  that 
result and s 45(3) emphasises the point by providing that a person is to be taken 
to have committed a principal offence only if the principal offence is committed.  
By  contrast,  s 47(1)  uses  the  expression  ""an  offence""  to  describe  a  criminal 
offence  which  has  not  yet  been  committed.    It  proscribes  the  act  of  urging  a 
person  to  do  something  which,  if  that  person  were  to  do  it,  would  be  ""an 
offence"".  It is not in terms directed to proscribing an act of urging a person to do 
an  act  which,  if  that  person  were  to  do  it,  would  not  itself  comprise  an  offence 
but  would,  when  and  if  the  principal  committed  the  principal  offence,  result  in 
the person so incited being taken to have committed the principal offence.  And, 
although it would not be impossible to read the provision as being so directed, it 
would  require  the  reading  in  of  a  significant  number  of  words  in  order  to 
conclude that ""urges the commission of an offence"" in s 47(1) includes ""urges the 
commission  of  such  acts  of  aiding,  abetting,  counselling  or  procuring  the 
commission of a principal offence as might, when and if the principal offence is 
ever committed, result under s 45(1) in the incitee being taken to have committed 
the principal offence"".  Beyond question, it is a strong thing to read words into a 
statute  and,  therefore,  it  is  something  which  courts  should  be  hesitant  to  do64.

And  where  the  effect  would  be  to  create  a  degree  of  criminal  liability  that  the 
Parliament has not clearly signalled it intends to impose, it is necessary to be still 
more hesitant65.  

 
The Crown contended that, because s 47(4) provides that a person may be 
found  guilty  of  the  offence  of  incitement  even  if  it  is  impossible  to  commit  the 
offence incited, it would only be logical to construe s 47 as having the effect that 
a  person  may  be  found  guilty  of  an  offence  of  incitement  where,  although  it  is 
possible  to  commit  the  offence  incited,  the  offence  is  not  committed.    So  much 
may  readily  be  accepted.    But  it  does  not  detract  from  the  conclusion  already 
expressed that s 47 proscribes the act of urging a person to do something which, 
if that person were to do it, would be an offence (scil ""procuring the commission 
of a principal offence""); as opposed to urging a person to do something which, if 
the person so incited were to do it, would not be an offence, but would, when and 
if  the  principal  offence  were  committed,  result  in  the  person  so  incited  being 
taken  to  have  committed  the  principal  offence.    Section 47(4)  restates  the 
position which existed at common law that an accused could be convicted of an 
offence  of  incitement  even  though  the  offence  incited  was  not  committed  and 
even  though  the  offence  incited  could  not  in  fact  be  committed66.    But, 
consistently with the common law67, s 47(4) does not imply that an accused may 
be  convicted  of  inciting  another  person  to  do  something  which,  if  it  could  be 
done and were done, would not be an offence. 

There  are  also  indications  elsewhere  in  the  Criminal  Code  that  s 47(1) 
 
does  not  apply  to  an  act  of  urging  a  person  to  procure  the  commission  of  an 
offence.    Section  47(6)  provides  that  s 47  does  not  apply  to  an  offence  against 
s 44  (attempt),  s 48  (conspiracy)  or  s 47  (incitement).    The  manifest  purpose  of

that provision is to ensure that it is not an offence to incite the commission of an 
inchoate  offence  of  attempt,  conspiracy  or  incitement.    Section 47(6)  does  not 
provide,  however,  that  s 47  does  not  apply  to  an  inchoate  offence  of  aiding, 
abetting, counselling or procuring the commission of an offence.  The most likely 
reason  for  that  is  that  the  drafters  of  the  Criminal  Code  did  not  intend  s 45  to 
create,  or  consider  that  it  did  create,  an  inchoate  offence  of  aiding,  abetting, 
counselling or procuring the commission of an offence.  Instead, for the reasons 
already  stated,  it  is  to  be  inferred  that  they  intended  and  considered  that  s 45 
should  and  would  do  no  more  than  deem  a  person  who  has  aided,  abetted, 
counselled or procured the commission of an offence, when and if the offence is 
committed, to have committed that offence.   

 
The  likelihood  of  that  being  so  is  further  fortified  by  an  appreciation  of 
what the consequences would be if that were not the case.  If s 47 did make it an 
offence to urge a person to procure the commission of an offence, it would mean 
that, although a person cannot be convicted of inciting another person to ""incite"" 
(scil  ""urge"")  a  third  person  to  commit  an  offence  (because  of  the  express 
exclusion in s 47(6) of offences of incitement from the application of s 47), such 
a person may be convicted of an offence of inciting another person to ""procure"" 
(scil ""urge"") a third person to commit an offence.  There is no sense in that, and it 
was not suggested that there is any other explanation for caprice and incongruity 
of  that  order  within  the  frame  of  the  one  provision.    The  more  likely,  and 
therefore  more  compelling68,  construction  is  that  s 47  does  not  apply  to  the 
incitement of a person to procure the commission of a principal offence because, 
even  when  and  if  the  principal  offence  is  committed,  it  will  remain  that  the 
person  so  incited  will  not  have  committed  an  offence  of  procuring  the 
commission of the principal offence.  Instead, when and if the principal offence 
is  committed,  the  person  so  incited  to  procure  the  commission  of  the  principal 
offence will be deemed by operation of s 45(1) to have committed the principal 
offence;  and,  at  that  point,  but  not  before,  the  incitor  will  have  committed  an 
offence of inciting the person so incited to commit the principal offence.

extent  to  which  those  recommendations  do  or  do  not  appear  to  have  been 
implemented, support that party's preferred construction of s 47.  In fact, there is 
little assistance to be derived from the extrinsic materials either way.  At various 
points  and  in  various  ways  the  reports  of  the  Gibbs  Committee  and  the  Model 
Criminal Code Officers Committee point in opposite directions.  The safest guide 
is the language of the legislation and the requirement for clarity in the framing of

Conclusion 

88 

 
In  the  view  which  I  take  of  the  operation  of  s 47(1),  it  is  unnecessary  to 
consider  the  effect  of  s 47(5).    Accordingly,  for  these  reasons,  I  agree  in  the 
orders proposed by Kiefel CJ, Bell and Gordon JJ.

 Steven Chong JA (delivering the judgment of the court 
ex tempore
):
1       In 
Liew Zheng Yang v Public Prosecutor
 
[2017] SGHC 157
 (“the Judgment”), I allowed the appeal by the appellant, Liew Zheng Yang (“Liew”), against his conviction of two charges of abetting in a conspiracy to traffic controlled drugs under s 5(2) and s 12 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the MDA”), read with s 107(
b
) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (collectively, “the Conspiracy Charges”). I set aside his conviction for the Conspiracy Charges, and convicted him on two reduced charges of attempted possession of the same drugs under ss 8(
a
) and 12 of the MDA (“the Attempted Possession Charges”). The drugs in question were 34.53 grams of cannabis and 68.21 grams of cannabis mixture, for the first and second charges respectively.
2       The present matter concerns the sentences to be imposed in respect of the Attempted Possession Charges. In the course of this judgment, I will also address a new sentencing framework proposed by the Prosecution for the offence of drug possession.
3       Liew had also pleaded guilty to one charge of consumption of a cannabinol derivative under s 8(
b
)(ii) of the MDA (“the Consumption Charge”). The district judge sentenced Liew to six months’ imprisonment for the Consumption Charge, and Liew did not appeal against this sentence. Subsequently, after the Judgment was delivered, Liew brought Criminal Motion No 32 of 2017 (“CM 32/2017”) to seek an extension of time to file a notice of appeal against the sentence imposed for the Consumption Charge. I heard and dismissed CM 32/2017 on 19 September 2017, and stayed the execution of the sentence pending the determination of the sentences for the Attempted Possession Charges. Given that Liew has been convicted of three charges, the sentences for at least two of these charges must run consecutively: s 307(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed).
Parties’ submissions 
4       Parties are in agreement that the sentences for the Attempted Possession Charges should run consecutively with the sentence for the Consumption Charge. They differ, however, on the appropriate sentence for the Attempted Possession Charges.
5       Liew’s counsel, Mr Eugene Thuraisingam (“Mr Thuraisingam”), submits that a sentence of no more than 12 months’ imprisonment should be imposed for each of the Attempted Possession Charges. This will result in a global sentence of no more than 18 months’ imprisonment.
[note: 1]
6       The Prosecution, on the other hand, proposes the following indicative starting points for sentencing first-time offenders of drug possession involving cannabis and cannabis mixture (“the Indicative Table”):
[note: 2]
 
Cannabis
 
 
Cannabis Mixture
 
 
Imprisonment
 
 
Up to 15g
 
 
Up to 30g
 
 
6–18 months
 
 
15–165g 
 
 
30­–330g
 
 
18 months­–3 years
 
 
165–330g
 
 
330–660g
 
 
3–5 years
 
 
330–500g
 
 
660–1000g
 
 
5–7 years
 
 
More than 500g
 
 
More than 1000g
 
 
7–10 years
 
7       The indicative starting points in the Indicative Table are based on the quantity of drugs involved. The Prosecution submits that the Indicative Table is in line with the sentencing approach for drug trafficking offences, which also begins with indicative starting points based on the quantity of drugs involved, before adjusting the sentence based on the offender’s culpability and the presence of relevant aggravating or mitigating factors: 
Vasentha d/o Joseph v Public Prosecutor
 
[2015] 5 SLR 122
 (“
Vasentha
”) at [44].
[note: 3]
 The Prosecution also relies on 
Public Prosecutor v Jumahat Bin Japar
 
[2016] SGDC 278
 (“
Jumahat
”) as a precedent where the district judge had agreed with similar indicative starting points in relation to the possession of diamorphine and methamphetamine.
[note: 4]
8       On the basis of the Indicative Table, the Prosecution submits that Liew should be sentenced to a term of at least 24 months’ imprisonment for each of the Attempted Possession Charges and a global sentence of at least 30 months’ imprisonment.
[note: 5]
My Decision
The Indicative Table
9       In my view, it is not appropriate to adopt the indicative starting points proposed by the Prosecution. The Court of Appeal observed in 
Ng Kean Meng Terence v Public Prosecutor
 
[2017] 2 SLR 449
 at [30] that such an approach (which was referred to as the “multiple starting points” approach) “is suitable where the offence in question is clearly targeted at a 
particular
 mischief which is measurable according to a single (usually quantitative) metric that assumes primacy in the sentencing analysis” [emphasis in original]. The offence of drug 
trafficking
 was cited by the Court of Appeal as a “paradigmatic” example of such offences.
10     However, this does not mean that 
all
 drug-related offences are compatible with a multiple starting points approach. In 
Public Prosecutor v Tan Thian Earn
 
[2016] 3 SLR 269
, See Kee Oon JC (as he then was) expressly declined to adopt a “multiple starting points” approach for offences under s 10A(1) of the MDA. Section 10A(1) of the MDA proscribes the manufacture, supply, possession, import or export of any controlled equipment, materials, or substances which are useful for the manufacture of a controlled drug.
11     See JC explained (at [35]–[36]) that a “multiple starting points” approach was unsuitable for s 10A(1) offences because such offences may be committed “in a variety of circumstances and for a variety of reasons” such that “no sensible sentencing tariffs can be promulgated” for the offence if the culpability of the individual offender is not taken into account. See JC distinguished s 10A(1) offences from the offence of drug trafficking, as follows (at [36]):
… [The s 10A(1) offence] differs somewhat from the offence of trafficking, where the range of scenarios is more restricted and therefore the use of the quantity of drugs involved (which is the primary determinant of harm) suffices to provide a useful starting point. …
12     Similarly, the “multiple starting points” approach is unsuitable for the offence of drug possession. It cannot be denied that offenders who commit the offence might do so for a variety of reasons: (a) for trafficking; (b) for own consumption; and (c) for a purpose which is not clear on the evidence.
13     In fact, the very case which the Prosecution cited as supporting the Indicative Table, 
Jumahat
 (see above at [7]), stated at [20] that “if the accused had possessed the drugs for his own consumption, the figures in the [table of proposed indicative starting points] would not apply with as much persuasive force …”.
14     This must be correct because an offender who possesses drugs to traffic should be punished more severely than an offender who possesses drugs for his own consumption since in the former case, harm is caused to others while in the latter case, harm is caused to oneself.
15     Here, because of the manner in which the Prosecution conducted its case in the court below, in particular Liew’s unchallenged testimony that the drugs were for his own consumption, I found that the drugs were for Liew’s own consumption (the Judgment at [19]–[28]).
16     Therefore I would approach the sentencing of this case in the usual way by examining the aggravating and mitigating factors which are germane to the charge of possession for the purpose of his own consumption, keeping in mind the 
existing
 sentencing precedents.
The appropriate term of imprisonment 
17     In the context of the offence of drug consumption, the High Court in 
Dinesh Singh Bhatia s/o Amarjeet Singh v Public Prosecutor
 
[2005] 3 SLR(R) 1
 at [38] (“
Dinesh Singh
”) established a sentencing range of between six to 18 months’ imprisonment for first-time offenders. The court (at [38]–[39]) also identified the following non-exhaustive factors as relevant in calibrating the precise sentence for each offender:
(a)     the age of the offender;
(b)     the quantity of drugs involved;
(c)     the circumstances that led to the consumption of drugs (
eg
, whether the consumption of drugs was planned, and whether payment was made for the drugs); and
(d)     whether the offender was a first-time drug consumer, a casual consumer or an addict.
18     The sentencing range and a number of the factors identified in 
Dinesh Singh
 were applied recently by Sundaresh Menon CJ in the context of drug possession in 
Public Prosecutor v Lim Cheng Ji Alvin
 
[2017] SGHC 183
 at [28]–[29] (“
Alvin Lim
”). In 
Alvin Lim
, the offender was charged for the possession of 0.91 grams of cannabis mixture, which were meant for his own consumption. The offender was originally sentenced by the district judge to probation. Upon the prosecution’s appeal to the High Court, Menon CJ set aside the probation order, and sentenced the offender to eight months’ imprisonment. In determining the appropriate sentence, Menon CJ took into account the offender’s relatively young age of 26 years old at the time of the offence and the fact that the offender was not a one-off user of drugs.
19     Applying the factors identified in 
Dinesh Singh
 to the present case, it was clear, as Mr Thuraisingam accepted, that the following factors were aggravating. First, a large quantity of drugs were involved. This is a point that I will return to later (below at [21]–[22]). Second, Liew was not a casual or a one-off user of drugs.
20     On the other hand, Liew was a young offender, aged 22, at the time of the offence. In addition, he has demonstrated his commitment to take responsibility to rid himself of the drug addiction problem. He sought treatment with a psychiatrist,
[note: 6]
 has been drug-free in the three years since the offences and is presently gainfully employed.
21     With these factors in mind, I turn to calibrate the precise length of imprisonment. In my view, it would not be sufficient to compare the present case with 
Dinesh Singh
 and 
Alvin Lim
 due to the large quantity of drugs involved in this case. It will be recalled that Liew had attempted to possess 34.53 grams of cannabis and 68.21 grams of cannabis mixture. This was far in excess of the amount of drugs (0.91 grams of cannabis mixture) involved in 
Alvin Lim
.
22      
Dinesh Singh
 was also somewhat less relevant because the quantity of drugs in Liew’s possession were far more than what a person could have consumed in one session. In fact, Liew’s own evidence at trial was that he had bought the drugs “in a huge amount” in order to “
stock up
 and keep it at home for… [his] own consumption” [emphasis added] (the Judgment at [19]). Bearing in mind that 
Dinesh Singh
 was a case on drug 
consumption
, the quantity of drugs in this case was arguably beyond the amounts contemplated by the High Court when the sentencing range of six to 18 months’ imprisonment was laid down. Therefore, it was more relevant to consider precedents where the quantity of drugs involved were similar to the present case.
23     In 
Public Prosecutor v Ang Wei Hsiung Kenneth
 
[2017] SGDC 70
 (“
Kenneth Ang (DC)
”), the offender (“Kenneth”) pleaded guilty to two possession charges and one consumption charge. The possessions charges related to 26.95 grams of cannabis and 72 tablets containing Nimetazepam, a Class C drug, respectively. Kenneth had intended to consume these drugs (at [3]). The offender was sentenced to 24 months’ imprisonment for the cannabis possession charge and five months’ imprisonment for Class C possession charge. These two sentences were ordered to run consecutively, resulting in a global sentence of 29 months’ imprisonment. Kenneth appealed against the sentences imposed, and the appeal was heard and dismissed by me in 
Ang Wei Hsiung Kenneth v Public Prosecutor
 Magistrate’s Appeal No 9064 of 2017 (30 June 2017) (
“Kenneth Ang (HC)
”).
24     The present case bore some similarities with 
Kenneth Ang (HC)
. Both Liew and Kenneth were drug addicts who had purchased comparable quantities of drugs for their own consumption. While the quantity of drugs that Liew had attempted to possess was somewhat larger than the quantity of drugs that Kenneth possessed, Liew was also considerably younger than the 38-year-old Kenneth. Kenneth also appeared to have a more serious drug problem than Liew as he consumed a wide variety of drugs (
Kenneth Ang (DC)
 at [1]–[2(i)]), whereas Liew’s involvement in drugs was confined to cannabis and its variants. On the whole, it was appropriate to impose a sentence on Liew that was shorter than the sentence imposed on Kenneth.
25     Taking into account the two accepted aggravating factors, that Liew was not a one-off drug user and that the quantity of the drugs involved was large, together with his relative young age and his commitment to take responsibility to rid himself of his drug addiction following his conviction, as well as the relevant sentencing benchmark, the most recent of which is 
Kenneth Ang (HC)
, I sentence Liew to 20 months’ imprisonment for each of the Attempted Possession Charges which is to run consecutively with the earlier 6-month sentence for the Consumption Charge for a global sentence of 26 months’ imprisonment. The sentence is to commence today.

	HOEBEN CJ at CL:
	


Offences and sentence

The applicant was tried before Fagan J and a jury and on 21 October 2015 was found guilty of the following counts:

Count 1 – That on 3 September 1988 at Little Bay he did have sexual intercourse with Doris Fenbow (the deceased) without her consent and knowing that she was not consenting (s 61D(1) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for 8 years (now repealed)).

Count 2 – That on 3 September 1988 at Little Bay he did murder the deceased, contrary to s 18 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) for which the maximum penalty was life imprisonment.


	
	The offences were committed against Doris Fenbow (the deceased) on 3 September 1988. Although the penalty for murder as at that date was penal servitude for life, the offence occurred one week before the applicant turned 18. Accordingly, s 442(1) of the Crimes Act (since repealed) applied, which allowed for the imposition of a lesser sentence.
	
	
	On 11 December 2015 the applicant was sentenced for the offence of sexual intercourse without consent to a fixed term of imprisonment of 6 years, commencing 12 September 2014 and expiring 11 September 2020. For the offence of murder, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 20 years, commencing 12 September 2014 and expiring 11 September 2034. The non-parole period was 15 years, to expire on 11 September 2029.
	
	
	The applicant seeks leave to appeal against those sentences. The grounds of appeal are:
	


Ground One – The learned sentencing judge erred in taking into account on sentence as an aggravating factor pursuant to s 21A(2)(l) that ‘the victim was vulnerable’.

Ground Two – The learned sentencing judge erred in his application of the principles applying to sentencing for historical offences in the circumstances of this case.

Ground Three – The learned sentencing judge erred in holding that there were not any special circumstances which would justify the downward adjustment of the ratio set out in s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

Ground Four – The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to assess the applicant’s moral culpability for the offences taking into account his deprived upbringing; cf Bugmy v R [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571; Ingrey v R [2016] NSWCCA 31 at [31] – [36].

Ground Five – The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to hold and take into account as a matter of mitigation in his determination of sentence that the applicant was a person to be regarded as a person of good character (s 21A(3)(f).

FACTUAL BACKGROUND


	
	The sentencing judge was required to find the facts consistent with the jury's verdicts. A document headed ""Agreed facts on sentence"" was tendered in the Crown sentencing bundle (Exhibit SA, tab 1). His Honour’s findings as to the facts are set out in the sentencing judgment (R v Katsis [2015] NSWSC 1890) at [3] - [28]).
	
	
	The deceased lived alone in a one bedroom unit in a Housing Commission complex of eight blocks of units. The applicant lived in a unit nearby in the same complex. The deceased was aged 66 at the time of her murder. She did not appear to have visitors and was not seen in the company of others. She did not care for herself well, her flat was untidy and unclean and her personal hygiene was poor. The applicant knew her by sight and was heard to refer to her as ""smelly"". On post-mortem examination she weighed 54 kilograms and was 172 centimetres in height.
	
	
	She was last seen alive by a neighbour at 6pm on Friday, 2 September 1988. At around 8am on Saturday 3 September, neighbours noticed smoke coming from her unit and called the Fire Brigade. Two neighbours forced their way into the unit to try to rescue her, but found her dead and retreated from the unit. When the Fire Brigade arrived and extinguished the fire, the deceased was found face down on the lounge room floor with smouldering cushions beside her and under her. She was wearing a bra, a light slip, a cardigan and a jacket. The slip was pulled up and she was exposed from the waist down.
	
	
	There were three seats of fire in the lounge room, including in cushions pushed under and against the deceased, and one seat of fire in the bedroom. The unit had been ransacked and a purse was open on the counter top. Hot plates on the electric stove were on and were glowing with heat. A large pane of glass was missing from a window in the bedroom, having been broken two weeks earlier. The Fire Brigade investigator estimated that the fire had burned for about one to two hours, from which his Honour inferred that the fire had commenced at around 6am.
	
	
	There was evidence of a struggle in the bedroom. On the bedroom floor were the deceased’s dentures, a watch with a broken strap and a small amount of blood. The autopsy report showed that the deceased had been severely assaulted. Her injuries included a bruised left eye and ear, broken fingernails on her right hand, scratch marks on her neck and under her chin, a round red bruise on her left breast and three fractured ribs on her left side, consistent with her having been punched or kicked or a knee being forced against her chest wall.
	
	
	The autopsy showed that the cause of death was asphyxiation, partly mechanical i.e. by manual strangulation evidenced by heavy bruising to her neck muscles and damage to her voice box. This indicated severe force over many seconds or a few minutes which could have rendered the deceased unconscious but still breathing. The asphyxiation was also partly chemical as evidenced by heavy soot in her windpipe and lungs, indicating that she had inhaled smoke. A blood sample showing 30 per cent carbon monoxide saturation confirmed the chemical component of asphyxiation.
	
	
	There was blood in the vicinity of the deceased's vagina and the internal vaginal wall was bruised in a manner consistent with penetration. Vaginal swabs revealed the presence of semen.
	
	
	The collection of forensic evidence from the unit was frustrated by the sparsity of traces and the damage done by the fire. Police interviewed many of the occupants of the unit complex but did not gain any leads. The applicant was interviewed at the time and said that he had gone to the Maroubra Bay Hotel with friends, where he met his sister and two other women. He said he remained there drinking until 2.30am and returned in a taxi with his sister and others. He said that he went to bed shortly after arriving home and did not see or hear anything that could assist.
	
	
	Although the police investigation had stalled in late 1988, the vaginal swabs were retained. By October 2003 the science in relation to DNA had advanced to the point that a DNA profile from the swabs could be obtained. A sperm fraction was identified from a retained swab of the deceased's vagina, and the DNA profile obtained from it was uploaded onto a database.
	
	
	In March 2014 a buccal swab was taken from the applicant when he commenced a sentence of imprisonment. His profile was uploaded onto the database and was found to be a match with the profile from the sperm fraction. On May 2014 the applicant was arrested and charged with these offences on the basis of the forensic evidence. He declined to participate in an interview with police.
	
	
	His Honour was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant returned home from the hotel at about 2.30am and that at some time between 3am and 6am entered the deceased's unit, most likely through the broken window in her bedroom or through the sliding door in her lounge room. His Honour was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant knew where the deceased lived and targeted her that night.
	
	
	The tender of the applicant's criminal record in the sentence proceedings showed a conviction in the Children's Court in 1988 for stealing on 22 October 1987. The applicant's evidence in the proceedings on sentence for the instant offences was that in 1987 and 1988 he and his sister had to provide food for themselves. That evidence and the stealing offence, taken together with the ransacking of the deceased's unit, gave rise to the reasonable possibility that the applicant intruded for the initial purpose of stealing from the deceased, that the rape occurred opportunistically and that the murder followed from that. His Honour accepted the Crown's submission on that issue and was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant entered the unit with the premeditated intent to rape and murder the deceased.
	
	
	The applicant gave evidence in the sentence hearing. He adhered to the evidence which he gave at trial and which was described by his Honour in the sentence judgment at [41] – [42] as follows:
	


“41   The offender said that once he was inside the unit Hayward fondled his penis, aroused him, performed oral sex on him and then pulled him into a prone position on top of [the deceased] and physically manipulated him to carry out the sexual act, all without volition on the offender's part. He said Hayward dragged his body backwards, one handed, to align him to penetrate [the deceased]. Then, again one handed, Hayward pushed his body forward to effect the penetration whilst holding the offender's penis in the other hand to ensure that this occurred.

42   In order to explain to the jury how this could possibly have taken place the offender asserted that Hayward had “something like a control over” him which caused him to remain passive throughout, in the fear of harm that might otherwise be inflicted. This “control” was attributed to the alleged experience of sexual abuse at Hayward's hands six years earlier. The offender told the jury that he fled [the deceased’s] unit after having penetrated her against his will. He said he knew nothing of how the fires were started.”


	
	The reference to ‘Hayward’ in the preceding passage came from the applicant’s evidence that he was sexually abused by a man named Kevin Hayward, who lived in one of the units. This was said to have occurred in about 1982 or 1983. His Honour accepted that there was a man named Kevin Hayward living there at the time. His Honour found that the applicant’s description of his sexual abuse by Hayward was an introductory aspect of the false narrative which he gave to the jury to try to explain the presence of his semen in the vagina of the deceased. The balance of this narrative was that, in the early evening of Friday, 2 September 1988, as the applicant walked past the deceased’s unit on an innocent errand, Hayward was loitering outside her bedroom window. The applicant said that Hayward pulled him into the unit where the deceased lay already unconscious on the lounge room floor.
	
	
	His Honour found that it was inherent in the jury’s verdict that they did not accept that this narrative was a reasonable possibility. His Honour further found:
	


“As the offender’s claim of having been sexually abused by Kevin Hayward in about 1982 or 1983 was an integral part of the exculpatory tale which the jury have rejected, I am left in great doubt as to whether he was ever abused by this man at all. I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that he was.” (Sentence judgment [44]).

Sentence judgment


	
	His Honour characterised the nature of the attack on the deceased as follows:
	


“27   The offender’s attack on [the deceased] was savage, inhuman and despicable. A vulnerable, inoffensive, lonely old lady was taken from her bed in the small hours of the morning and violently subdued. When her frail body had been used to satisfy the offender’s short lived impulse it was discarded to the fire. Her clothing was left pulled above her waist in the state in which [the applicant] had finished with her. [The deceased] died in pain, in terror and in degradation.”


	
	His Honour accepted that the applicant might still have been affected by the consumption of alcohol when he perpetrated these offences but his Honour was not able to say to what extent. It was the applicant’s sister’s evidence that he smoked a quantity of cannabis during the first 30 to 40 minutes after returning from the hotel to the family unit. His Honour was not able to make a finding as to the extent (if any) of his cannabis intoxication at the time when he committed these crimes.
	
	
	In relation to the applicant’s subjective case, both his father and mother were of Greek birth. The family came to Australia in 1977-1978 when the applicant was aged seven. The applicant struggled with his schooling and left school in 1986 aged 16. In his teen years, up to the date when the offences occurred, the applicant was athletic, active and played cricket and rugby league. He engaged in surfboard riding all year around, spending on average half a day in the surf every weekend. Not long after his arrival in Australia, the applicant’s father remarried. The applicant and his sister testified that their stepmother was loving, warm and caring.
	
	
	In contrast, the applicant and his sister gave evidence that their father was harsh and capricious. The applicant’s sister, who was three years older, described the father as “barbaric”. He inflicted corporal punishment on the applicant frequently, for little or no cause. He hit both the applicant and his sister. The applicant gave evidence that his father kept the household fridge locked and denied his children free access to it. The father was described as uncaring. On one occasion when the applicant injured his leg during play in the neighbourhood, his father force-marched him to a doctor in a manner which ran the risk of aggravating the leg injury, possibly to the point of doing irremediable harm.
	
	
	The applicant and his sister gave evidence that at times they visited a paternal uncle who lived in Sydney. While in the uncle’s care, he too inflicted corporal punishment. According to the applicant, the uncle on two occasions sexually abused him. His Honour was prepared to accept, on the balance of probabilities, that these events did occur as part of the family life of the applicant before September 1988.
	
	
	The reasons why his Honour rejected the applicant’s evidence of sexual abuse by Kevin Hayward have already been set out. The applicant’s sister gave evidence, which supported the applicant’s history of sexual abuse at the hands of Kevin Hayward. His Honour did not accept that evidence because she contradicted herself on a number of occasions.
	
	
	The applicant gave evidence that over a period of three years before September 1988, he had also been sexually abused by Ronald Jolley. Jolley was said to live in a unit next to Kevin Haywood. His Honour noted that Ronald Jolley was another person whom the applicant sought to weave into the rejected narrative of how he came to have intercourse with the deceased shortly before her murder. The applicant told the jury that there was a third male in the unit into which he was forced by Kevin Haywood. The applicant attempted to convey to the jury that he thought this person might have been Jolley and that Jolley was another person whom he feared from earlier experience. This narrative was intended to further explain his passivity at the hands of Haywood. His Honour was not satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that Ronald Jolley ever abused the applicant. His Honour reached that conclusion because the evidence concerning Ronald Jolley was integrally connected with the applicant’s exculpatory evidence to the jury involving Kevin Haywood. It was a narrative which the jury had rejected.
	
	
	His Honour took into account the applicant’s personal history since the commission of the crimes. About a year after the deceased’s murder, the applicant moved out of his father’s unit and lived with his sister and her young son at Matraville. He worked as a machine operator at that time. In 1990 he went to Greece and lived with a second uncle for a year. He returned to Australia in 1991 and found work in the construction industry. This lasted about four years.
	
	
	From 1994 or 1995 the applicant lived in Sydney with a female partner who became his fiancée. From 1995 to 1997 the applicant and his fiancée took care of the young son of his sister because she was unable to cope with the boy herself. In 1997 the applicant’s fiancée accidentally died and the applicant’s nephew was taken into care by the Department of Community Services. The applicant said that it was at this point that he became unable to manage the stresses in his life, attempted to commit suicide and became addicted to heroin. He said that these setbacks caused him to engage in criminal activity from 1997 to 2000. In 2000 the applicant undertook drug and alcohol rehabilitation with the assistance of the Salvation Army. In about 2001 he was able to resume work as a bartender.
	
	
	The applicant continued in regular employment until November 2007. During this period he commenced another relationship and his partner gave birth to his first son in 2005. A second boy was born in late 2007. In November 2007, while he was working as a bar manager, he was the victim of an armed robbery. Following this he developed post traumatic stress disorder and depression which led to the abuse of alcohol and other substances and to the separation from the mother of his two sons.
	
	
	His Honour reviewed the applicant’s criminal record. Since the date of the subject crimes, the applicant had committed numerous petty offences, mostly involving dishonesty but including two common assaults. The first period of offending was from August 1997 (aged 26) to early 2000 (aged 29). During that period, he was convicted of a few larcenies, possession of suspected stolen goods on a number of occasions, assault and minor drug possession. The penalties were fines, community service orders and suspended prison sentences.
	
	
	There were two shoplifting convictions in July and November 2004 which were dealt with by the imposition of supervised bonds. In July 2005 he was convicted on five counts of using a false instrument with intent to obtain more than $15,000. These offences were dealt with on 30 March 2007 when he received a suspended sentence of imprisonment for 12 months.
	
	
	In December 2011 the applicant committed the offences of larceny, damaging property, possession of suspected stolen goods and possession of housebreaking implements. Sentences of imprisonment were imposed by Burwood Local Court but on appeal, the District Court at Parramatta quashed the terms of fulltime custody and replaced them with suspended sentences of 12 months. On 13 March 2014 all of these suspended sentences were called up and the applicant commenced fulltime custody with the earliest date for release to parole fixed at 11 September 2014. It was when the applicant was taken into custody on these call ups, that the first buccal swab was taken which resulted in a match to the profile of the swab sample taken from the deceased’s body.
	
	
	His Honour concluded that the applicant’s record, which commenced nearly nine years after the crime for which he was being sentenced, was not a material factor in determining an appropriate sentence. His Honour noted that on the one hand the record did not include any significant offences of violence, nor any sexual offences. It could not be said against the applicant that his conduct subsequent to September 1988 demonstrated any heightened requirement for specific deterrence with respect to crimes of this nature, or that the future protection of the community was a pressing consideration. On the other hand his Honour noted that it could not be said that the applicant had since September 1988 lived an exemplary or blameless life which might be regarded as having redeemed to any degree his grave crimes of September 1988. His Honour regarded the applicant’s criminal record after this offending as not attracting lenience but as being essentially neutral.
	
	
	His Honour accepted that being in prison for a substantial term, commencing 27 years after he committed these crimes, would give rise to hardship for the applicant. Not only did it bring to an end the life which he had been leading but he would not be able to participate in the raising of his two sons. His partner and the mother of his sons had ceased contact with him since the verdicts were delivered. His Honour rejected the applicant’s submission that the long delay between the offending and sentence should be taken into account so as to reduce the term. His Honour found that the time lapse was due to the lack of detection of the offending. It arose directly from the applicant’s concealment of his crime. His Honour concluded that it was not a delay which could be attributed in any way to the police, the prosecution or the court.
	
	
	His Honour also rejected a submission that the fear of detection and the long period of uncertainty between the crimes and when he was sentenced should be taken into account in mitigation of penalty. His Honour found that not only was the long period between offending and apprehension brought about by the applicant’s own actions, there was no satisfactory evidence that during that time the applicant suffered any “severe distress and anxiety as a consequence of the events” of 3 September 1988. The only evidence which the applicant gave concerning his thoughts about the victim and the offending was that he had often wished that he had “spoken out” so that “people that are responsible” might have been dealt with. His Honour did not regard that as a genuine expression of any haunting thoughts upon the deceased’s fate. His Honour characterised it as a reiteration of the applicant’s attribution of these crimes to others, which was the narrative rejected by the jury.
	
	
	His Honour did not accept that the applicant had demonstrated any remorse for the crimes for which he was being sentenced. He had not even acknowledged those crimes. His Honour noted that even though the police had confronted him with irrefutable scientific evidence linking him to the scene of the crime, he had run this matter to completion and had put forward a story to explain how his semen could have been found in the vagina of the deceased and yet he could not have intentionally had intercourse with her and been her killer. The closest the applicant came to expressing any remorse was when he said:
	


“A. Well I feel sorry for what happened to Doris, yes. I regret not speaking out and the main person that’s the victim is Doris before me or anyone and she’s the one that paid the ultimate price here and I regret that I hadn’t spoken out earlier to get the perpetrators did what they did here.” [64]


	
	His Honour characterised that as a “post verdict reiteration” by him of his claim that he was not responsible for the offending because he was physically manipulated to perform the act and did so without volition on his part.
	
	
	His Honour noted that when determining the length of the sentence to be imposed, he had to have regard to general sentencing principles and patterns of sentencing for the offences in question as they were applied at the time when the offending occurred. His Honour had specific regard to the decisions in MPB v R [2013] NSWCCA 213; 234 A Crim R 576 at [12]; SHR v R [2014] NSWCCA 94 at [54]; RL v R [2015] NSWCCA 106 at [7] – [8].
	
	
	On this issue his Honour said:
	


“72   The requirement that the sentence now to be passed should conform to patterns of sentencing applicable at the time of his offending (see [67] above) is a particular application of the Court’s general endeavour to achieve consistency between sentences imposed for similar crimes committed by offenders with similar subjective attributes: Wong v R (2001) 207 CLR 584; Green v R; Quinn v R (2011) 244 CLR 462.

73   Both counsel have referred me to statistical studies which suggest trends in the severity of sentences imposed for murder in New South Wales over the decades from the 1980s to the present. I have not relied upon the statistical information because it does not provide any detail of the manner of commission of the murders for which individual sentences were imposed nor any description of the subjective attributes of the individual offenders. I have instead reviewed unreported sentencing remarks in a number of cases of murder and murder/rape committed in the 1980s and 1990s, with a view to gauging the measure of punishment imposed by other judges of this court in comparable circumstances.”


	
	His Honour took into account, in favour of the applicant, his youth at the time of the offending, although he was very close to the age of 18 at that time. His Honour took into account that the relevance of his youth was that the offending may have been the product of immaturity and that prospects of rehabilitation with increasing years might appear favourable. Accordingly, his Honour found:
	


“69   … In sentencing Alexis Katsis after the lapse of so many years the adoption of this approach is confirmed by subsequent events. I have mentioned that his conduct since 1988 has been entirely free of sexual offences and free of any significant violence. After the lapse of 27 years I see no risk of him reoffending in the manner of the crimes for which he is now to be dealt with.”


	
	His Honour took into account that although he allowed for youth, his good prospects of rehabilitation and the absence of significant offending, it was still necessary for the sentence ultimately imposed to show the Court’s denunciation of the brutal crimes against the deceased and to provide general deterrence to others. His Honour observed that the difficulties associated with that task were appropriately summarised in RL v R  at [46]:
	


“… there is a high level of tension in relation to sentencing offenders years after the events which constitute the criminal conduct, in providing adequate punishment, giving some effect to general deterrence, denouncing the conduct of the offender and recognising the harm done to the victim, in circumstances where there is no palpable risk of reoffending, no need to deter the offender, no need to protect the community from the offender nor to promote the rehabilitation of the offender. …”


	
	His Honour took into account as an aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(l) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) that the offences were committed in the deceased’s home and that the deceased was vulnerable.
	
	
	As foreshadowed by his Honour, in order to impose a sentence which was consistent with general sentencing principles and patterns, as they were applied at the time of the offending, his Honour reviewed the sentencing remarks in a number of cases of murder and murder/rape committed in the 1980s and 1990s.
	
	
	The cases reviewed by his Honour and their relevant features were as follows: R v Bossie (Supreme Court (NSW), Studdert J, 16 April 1992, unrep). The offender was sentenced for the rape and murder of a 24 year old victim in February 1991. The offender was aged 21 at the date of the offence, had followed the victim after she left a discotheque and pulled her off the road along which she was walking into scrub where he clubbed, strangled and raped her. He pleaded guilty on the fourth day of trial. Subjective features were that he had a borderline intellectual disability, was extremely immature and was of previous good character. He was sentenced to a fixed term of 6 years for the rape, concurrent with the sentence for murder, which was 20 years with a non-parole period of 14 years. The sentence reflected a degree of leniency because of the plea.
	
	
	R v Sharpe (Supreme Court (NSW) Wood J, 9 September 1992, unrep). The offender was sentenced for a murder committed in August 1990 when he was 19. The victim was 43 years old. The offender had gone to her home for the purpose of having sexual intercourse with her in circumstances where he believed that this was appropriate retribution for what he falsely perceived to be her interference in the marriage of his own parents. The offender beat the victim about the head and strangled her. The offender had attempted unsuccessfully to have sexual intercourse with the victim.
	
	
	The genuineness of the offender’s contrition and remorse made a strong impression on the sentencing judge. The offender had attempted to take his own life while in custody. He had abused alcohol and cannabis before the offence but had shown no previous propensity for violence. His plea of guilty was supported with favourable references from associates and an employer. A total sentence of 18 years with a non-parole period of 10 years was imposed. This reflected the sentencing judge’s favourable findings with respect to contrition, remorse and other subjective features. His Honour noted that no considerations of that kind applied to the applicant and that no character evidence had been called on his behalf.
	
	
	In R v Dargin [2000] NSWSC 710 (Ireland AJ) the offender was aged 22 and the offending comprised murder and aggravated sexual assault which occurred in September 1998. The victim was aged 72 and the offender had followed her home with a view to stealing from her. The victim died as a result of blows to her face and head from the offender’s fists. The intent found was to cause grievous bodily harm rather than to kill.
	
	
	The offender was on bail at the time, he had a long criminal history including violence and he was intoxicated. The offender pleaded guilty when the trial was about to commence. Other than the plea of guilty, the offender demonstrated no remorse or contrition. He received a head sentence of imprisonment for 19 years with a non-parole period of 14 years.
	
	
	When comparing the offender in R v Dargin with the applicant, his Honour identified two factors significantly more favourable to Dargin, i.e. his plea of guilty and that his intention was to inflict grievous bodily harm, whereas his Honour found that the applicant’s intention was to kill. On the other hand, Dargin’s criminal history before the offence was significant, whereas the applicant had no material convictions before the offending.
	
	
	R v Fleming [2007] NSWSC 673 concerned a rape and murder committed in February 1984. The offender was aged 30 when he murdered a young woman in a small park at Neutral Bay. The victim was strangled with a ligature. The offender had intercourse with the victim after her death. An arrest could only be made many years later in 2005 when DNA profiles taken from the victim’s body could be matched to the offender. The offender maintained his plea of not guilty and expressed no contrition. He had a previous conviction for rape in Queensland for which he had been convicted in 1976. In written submissions in the sentence proceedings the applicant gave considerable emphasis to this case.
	
	
	The offender was aged 54 when he was sentenced by Studdert J. He had a personality disorder and suffered other significant medical problems. His Honour took into account the added hardship of custody for the offender because of his psychological and physical health conditions. Studdert J imposed a term of imprisonment of 21 years with a non-parole period of 16 years. By way of comparison with this case, his Honour noted that Fleming was sentenced as an offender with a serious previous conviction for a sexual offence and that he was a mature adult when the murder was committed in 1984.
	
	
	In R v Matthews [2014] NSWSC 608 Bellew J sentenced an offender for murder which had been committed in February 1992. The victim was a prostitute aged 39 whom the offender with two others had taken to an isolated bush location where sexual intercourse occurred multiple times and the victim had been killed by blows to the head with a rock. The offender was aged 21. He had left school at the end of year 10 and had used drugs from the age of 12, moving on to heroin at age 16. He pleaded guilty on the first day of trial for which a discount of 10 per cent on sentence was allowed.
	
	
	Bellew J accepted that the offender was genuinely remorseful. His criminal history both before and after this murder did not involve violence and his Honour found that it contained nothing to disentitle him to leniency. His prospects of rehabilitation were found to be generally encouraging. The offender was sentenced to imprisonment for 21½ years with a non-parole period of 16 years and 3 months.
	
	
	When considering the offence of sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61D(1) Fagan J concluded that the way in which the applicant perpetrated the crime placed it well into the upper range of seriousness for an offence of this type although not in the worst category of case. He made the 6 year fixed term for the sexual intercourse offence fully concurrent with the sentence he imposed for the murder. This was consistent with how the sexual offending had been treated in the cases reviewed by his Honour.
	
	
	His Honour declined to make a finding of special circumstances which would justify the non-parole period being anything less than three-quarters of the term of the sentence. His Honour considered that the remainder of the term of the sentence after the non-parole period had been served would be ample for the applicant’s rehabilitation under the supervision of the Community Corrections Service.
	
	
	The commencement date of the sentences was backdated to 12 September 2014. This took into account the period of time which the applicant had spent in custody, bail refused.
	


Ground 1 – The learned sentencing judge erred in taking into account on sentence as an aggravating factor pursuant to s 21A(2)(l) that “the victim was vulnerable”.


	
	The applicant submitted that in terms of the section, the age of the victim alone was insufficient to trigger its application. The deceased was 66 years of age at the time of the offence and was not “very old”, nor was she an “elderly victim” and there was no evidence that she suffered from a “disability”. While accepting that the deceased lived on her own in Housing Commission accommodation, was a slight woman, had few visitors, had poor hygiene and did not care for herself well, the applicant submitted that this was not sufficient to bring the offence within the section which is directed at a particular “class of victim” (R v Tadrosse [2005] NSWCCA 145; 65 NSWLR 740).
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the applicant’s submissions on this ground of appeal unduly confined the class of persons contemplated by s 21A(2)(l) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (the Act). The Crown submitted that the words “because the victim was very young or very old or had a disability” were not to be interpreted as strictly requiring those characteristics to be present before a victim could be said to be vulnerable but were no more than illustrative of characteristics in a victim that might amount to vulnerability. The Crown submitted that the examples referred to in s 21A(2)(l) were not exhaustive.
	
	
	The Crown relied upon Longworth v R [2017] NSWCCA 119. This was a case where the sentencing judge found that security guards working late at night at licensed premises were a class of persons who were vulnerable. The sentencing judge’s findings were upheld by this Court on appeal (Macfarlan JA, with whom Harrison and Schmidt JJ agreed).
	
	
	In the course of his judgment, Macfarlan JA said:
	


“17   The examples given in (l) are not exhaustive. They are concerned with classes of persons into which the victim may have fallen. That which is of present relevance is vulnerability of the victim arising as a result of his or her occupation. The examples of occupations in that category (“taxi driver, bus driver or other public transport worker, bank teller or service station attendant”) are occupations where the worker is often isolated from other people and sometimes in possession of significant amounts of money.

18   Whilst not one of the occupations specifically referred to in the section, Mr Taiba’s occupation as a security guard was also one where the worker is often isolated from others who may be able to come to his or her assistance. Or the security guard and his or her assistants may simply be outnumbered. In addition, where he or she acts as a security guard for a licensed hotel or club, the person is often liable to encounter and to have to control the conduct of individuals who are intoxicated and/or disorderly. The risk of such a security guard being subjected to aggression from such individuals is significant in light of the duties of the guard’s employer to eject intoxicated and disorderly persons from, and prevent the admission or re-admission to, the licensed hotel or club.”

Consideration


	
	As was made clear in Longworth v R the examples given in s 21A(2)(l) of the Act are not exhaustive but illustrative. What is required is that a particular class of person with a particular vulnerability deriving from the person’s membership of that class is identified rather than focusing upon the particular circumstances of the particular victim.
	
	
	Regrettably, in our urban society there is a class of persons into which category the deceased came. That class of person has the following characteristics – she is elderly, lives alone, does not associate with other persons, has no community support and does not look after herself. Because of that social isolation, such persons are often frail and undernourished and can properly be regarded as members of a class who are vulnerable.
	
	
	It is also not without significance that no submissions to the contrary were made by counsel for the applicant in the sentence proceedings.
	
	
	This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 2 – The learned sentencing judge erred in his application of the principles applying to sentencing for historical offences in the circumstances of this case.

Ground 3 – The learned sentencing judge erred in holding that there were not any special circumstances which would justify the downward adjustment of the ratio set out in s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.


	
	The applicant dealt with these matters together. He submitted that a sentencing judge when dealing with historic offences, must take into account the sentencing patterns and principles that existed at the time of the offence. He relied upon cases such as R v MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129; 54 NSWLR 368 and R v Magnuson [2013] NSWCCA 50 at [84] as authority for that proposition. The applicant submitted that although his Honour said that he had regard to this principle, he did not apply it.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that in relation to offences that occurred during the 1970s and 1980s, in the absence of any statutory provision setting out the length of a non-parole period, a sentencing practice which can be identified was that the courts would set the non-parole periods somewhere between one-third and one-half of the term of the sentence (AJB v R [2007] NSWCCA 51; 169 A Crim R 32 at [36]-[39]). The applicant submitted that this practice existed even in relation to offences described as “worst case”. The applicant specifically referred to PH v R [2009] NSWCCA 161 at [39]-[40] where it was held that the minimum period in custody should have been no more than 45 per cent of the overall sentence. The applicant submitted that this was an aspect of sentencing practice that had moved adversely to him by the time he stood to be sentenced for these offences. He submitted that it was a practice that should have been taken into account by his Honour when determining an appropriate sentence.
	
	
	The applicant noted that at the time of the offences, although s 19 of the Crimes Act carried a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, s 442 of the Crimes Act permitted a lesser penalty to be imposed on young persons. He noted that at the time of the offences, there was no requirement for special circumstances to be established in order for there to be a reduction in the non-parole period. The applicant further noted that while s 20A of the Probation and Parole Act 1983 (NSW), which commenced on 1 January 1988, applied a statutory ratio whereby the non-parole period was to be “at least three-quarters” of the length of the sentence for a serious offence, s 21(3) which was enacted at the same time, left a discretion to the court to impose a different non-parole period for a serious offence if “it determines that the circumstances justify that course”. The applicant submitted that this sentencing practice and patterns in relation to setting non-parole periods could be readily discerned and ought to have been considered by his Honour and taken into account when determining his sentence.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that his Honour made no reference to that practice or that legislation when he refused at [84] of the sentence judgment to make a finding of special circumstances. The applicant submitted that his Honour erred in holding that there were no special circumstances justifying the reduction in the non-parole period from three-quarters of the term of the sentence. This was because he made no reference to that sentencing practice at the time when he declined to make a finding of special circumstances.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that his Honour failed to give adequate weight to his youth when determining sentence. He submitted that at the time of the offending, the sentencing practice which applied to young persons was correctly summarised in R v GDP (1991) 53 A Crim R 112 where Mathews J (Gleeson CJ and Samuels JA agreeing) approved the remarks of Yeldham J where his Honour “remarked” during the course of sentencing a young offender that “in the case of a youthful offender … considerations of punishment and of general deterrence of others may properly be largely discarded in favour of individualised treatment of the offender directed to his rehabilitation”.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that it was no answer to the statement of principle in GDP that at the time of the offending he was very close to the age of 18 and that the offending was of such seriousness as to be characterised as “adult behaviour”. The applicant submitted that while the nature and circumstances of his offences were extremely serious, they were not the end of the inquiry insofar as determining whether the crimes were of an adult nature.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that his Honour erred in putting to one side statistical aids provided by both the Crown and defence counsel which related to sentencing in the 1980s and instead relying upon his own review of unreported sentencing remarks in other cases involving murder/rape committed in the 1980s. The applicant submitted that the five cases analysed by his Honour did not sufficiently inform him of a comparable range of sentences for young offenders for the period 1980 – 1998.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that a review of the five cases referred to by his Honour “with a view to gauging the measure of punishment imposed by the judges of this Court in comparable circumstances” supported his contention that his youth at the time of the offending and sentencing practices as at 1988 for offences such as these, were not properly reflected in this sentence. The applicant submitted that of the five cases reviewed by his Honour, none had involved an offender under 18 years of age with the youngest offender being 19 and the oldest 30.
	
	
	In summary, the applicant submitted that his Honour’s sentencing discretion had miscarried and that a lesser head sentence and non-parole period, including a finding of special circumstances, were warranted having regard to the sentencing patterns at the time.
	


Consideration


	
	His Honour acknowledged in his reasons that the sentencing practices at the date of the commission of the offences had to be applied (at [39] hereof). His Honour, however, was unable to determine a clear sentencing pattern. This is not surprising when one has regard to the general nature of the statistics with which his Honour was provided and their lack of specificity in relation to the circumstances of the murders for which individual sentences were imposed and the absence of the subjective attributes of the individual offenders. It was for that reason that his Honour looked at five generally similar cases involving young but not juvenile offenders who were sentenced for crimes of murder associated with sexual offences.
	
	
	It is not correct to say, as the applicant implicitly does, that a clear sentencing practice could be discerned in respect of crimes of murder associated with sexual offences, for the 1980s. In that regard, crimes of murder associated with sexual offences, were in a different category to sexual offences per se and in particular, sexual offences committed against children. In relation to such latter offences, as was set out in Magnuson v R, a sentencing pattern could be established (Button J at [90] with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Bellew J agreed). Moreover Magnuson v R also confirmed the traditional approach of imposing sentences for historical offences where a sentencing pattern was unable to be discerned. There Button J said:
	


“85   If such a pattern is unable to be discerned, the judge should commence the sentencing process in the usual way; that is, by reference to the maximum penalty, and the place in the range of objective gravity occupied by the offence: see Moon v R [2000] NSWCCA 534; (2000) 117 A Crim R 497 at [66] - [71] per Howie J (with whom Fitzgerald JA agreed).”


	
	It is also significant that in Magnuson v R where a sentencing practice for sexual offences committed against children was identified, the court restated the fundamental principle that “even when giving effect to that principle, sentences imposed now must adequately reflect the criminality of any offender whenever the offences were committed” (Button J at [133]).
	
	
	As was acknowledged by this Court (Basten JA Simpson and Adamson JJ) in RL v R, sentencing for historical sexual offences is not a simple process but involves real difficulties and an application of sometimes conflicting principles:
	


“6   Sentencing in a case of this kind is fraught with difficulties, both in terms of principle and technicality. So far as principle is concerned, there is an anxious tension between the need for public condemnation of the conduct involved and the vindication of the dignity of the victims, on the one hand, and on the other, the imposition some 30 years after the events, of penal consequences on an offender who has led a subsequently blameless life and has readily acknowledged his own wrongdoing, when confronted with the complaints.

7   Further, principle requires that the Court take into account the law as it applied at the time of the offending. Not only is the offender to be charged with offences as they were identified in the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) at the time of the offending, but he is subject only to the range of penalties available under the law at that time, and to general sentencing principles as then applied.

8   The technical difficulties are also relevant. The last principle requires, in effect, that an offender not be sentenced more harshly than would have occurred had the sentencing and the offending been roughly contemporaneous. One result of that principle is that the court must have regard to the relationship accepted at that time between the minimum term (or non-parole period) and the full term of the sentence. On the other hand, the Court does not sentence in accordance with the law as then in place, but imposes a sentence under the current law, namely the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (“the Sentencing Procedure Act”).”


	
	In MPB v R Basten JA identified further difficulties with the concepts of “sentencing practice” and “sentencing pattern”. There, his Honour said:
	


“9   The language of ""sentencing practice"" and ""sentencing pattern"" has acquired a currency of its own: see AJB v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 51; 169 A Crim R 32 at [31] (Howie J distinguishing ""sentencing practices"" from ""executive practices"" with respect to remission); and at [39] (referring to fixing of non-parole periods); Rosenstrauss v R [2012] NSWCCA 25 at [7]-[9] (in my judgment) and Magnuson v R [2013] NSWCCA 50 at [84]-[88] (Button J, McClellan CJ at CL and Bellew J agreeing). This language is, however, imprecise and covers a range of considerations and a range of sources. Thus, with respect to sources, the statements would appear to cover:

(a)    statutory provisions;

(b)    general law principles and underlying policies, and

(c)    practices (that is, application of principles) as revealed by outcomes.

10   With respect to the subject matter covered, this would include:

(a)    prescribed penalties (including maxima);

(b)    methods of proceeding (including the fixing of non-parole periods);

(c)    factors to be taken into account, and

(d)    facts as found.

…

12   It follows that the sentencing judge must sentence according to the penalties available at the time of the offending, taking into account the range of conduct covered by the offence. …

13   What has not been fully considered to date, is the potential operation of other statutory provisions. Thus, in AJB and in Rosenstrauss, it was accepted that, in order to give effect to ""sentencing practices"" at the time of the offences, it would be appropriate to set a non-parole period of less than half the head sentence. Similarly, in Magnuson, it appears to have been assumed that s 21A of the Sentencing Procedure Act was to be applied in sentencing for offences which pre-dated the commencement of the Act. These assumptions depend upon the operation of the Sentencing Procedure Act, subject to the operation of the transitional provisions in Schedule 2 of the Act.

…

15   There is also the difficulty, adverted to by Spigelman CJ in MJR, of identifying how general law principles were to be identified and their application assessed at a distant point in time. On the one hand, it may be expected that general principles will not have changed greatly. One example of change, however, is the attitude towards pleas of guilty. Thus, some recent cases have referred to R v Thomson and Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383 as identifying the discount for a plea of guilty, although it post-dated the conduct in question by decades.

…

19   The appropriate resolution of these difficulties is to give primary attention to the range of penalties available (usually a maximum term of imprisonment) and the conduct to which such penalties applied at the date of the offence, in order to assess objectively where, on a broad scale, such offending was likely to fall. These are matters to be determined by reference to the statutory provisions.”


	
	Where Basten JA differed from the other two judges in MPB (R A Hulme and Garling JJ) was that Basten JA was unable to discern a sentencing practice or pattern for the offences under consideration whereas the majority did so and applied that practice. Since he was unable to identify such a sentencing practice, Basten JA set out what he regarded as the correct approach to historical offences where no sentencing practice or pattern could be identified.
	


“34   It follows that the correct approach to the fixing of the sentence involves the following steps:

(a)    determine the facts as now available to the court;

(b)    have regard to the maximum penalty in force at the time of the offending, as a guide to the range of punishment then available;

(c)    identify where, within the range of offending conduct covered by the offence charged, the offence under consideration falls;

(d)    fix the term of the sentence or sentences;

(e)    determine whether special circumstances require that the relationship prescribed by s 44 be varied, and

(f)    fix a non-parole period in accordance with s 44 of the Sentencing Procedure Act (as in force prior to the 2002 Amendment Act).

35   In accordance with that approach, it is neither necessary nor appropriate to have regard to the actual patterns or practices of sentencing which are now believed to have operated at the time of the offending, whether based on acceptable statistical evidence, cases or memory.”


	
	A similar problem to that which confronted Fagan J in this case was considered by this Court in CT v R [2017] NSWCCA 15 where Hoeben CJ at CL (with whom Johnson and Latham JJ agreed) said:
	


“52   Given that state of the evidence, her Honour was entitled to not only have regard to the effect of those cases but also to the principles identified in Magnuson that in the absence of a clear sentencing pattern, a court can take into account that sentences passed at the relevant time tended to be more lenient than those at the present time, and that there has been a steady increase since then. A sentencing judge should take into account that even when dealing with old offences, a court must impose sentences that adequately reflect the criminality of an offence regardless of when the offences were committed and that a non-parole period represents the minimum period of imprisonment required to be served by an offender having regard to all the purposes of punishment (Power v The Queen [1974] HCA 26; 131 CLR 623).”


	
	His Honour was fully cognisant of the requirement to have regard to the principles applying to sentencing for historical offences. He specifically referred to the maximum penalties applicable in 1988 (judgment [2]), the effect on the applicant of being imprisoned after a long time lapse between the commission of the offences and sentencing (judgment [55] – [57]), the general principles of sentencing for historical offences (judgment [66] – [67], the relevance of his youth at the time of the offending (judgment [68] – [70]), the requirement to conform to patterns applicable at the time of the offending (judgment [72]) and made reference to generally comparable cases of murder associated with sexual assault (sentence [74] – [82]).
	
	
	It is clear from his Honour’s reasons that while a sentencing pattern may have been suggested by the statistics, his Honour regarded them as unreliable for the reasons which he gave. His Honour’s reasoning in that regard is entirely consistent with the significant body of case authority which draws attention to the shortcomings of the use of statistics in the sentencing process.
	
	
	While it can be accepted that historical sentencing practices in relation to some sexual offences, particularly those against children, can be identified those practices do not automatically translate to an appropriate sentence for an offence of murder associated with sexual intercourse. None of the authorities provided by the applicant in support of the proposition that non-parole periods during the 1980s were typically between one-third and one-half of the full term of sentence, are murder cases.
	
	
	The applicant’s reliance upon PH v R (an historical child sexual assault case) is, with respect, misconceived. That decision is relied upon to support an argument that even for offences described as “worst case” the minimum period in custody (even for murder) should have been no more than 45 per cent of the total sentence. It is difficult to see how such a sentence could ever be appropriate for a murder of the type that occurred in the present case which is clearly at the high end of objective seriousness. It should be noted that his Honour’s finding was that the attack on the victim was “savage, inhuman and despicable”.
	
	
	As was made clear in Magnuson v R, RL v R and MPB v R, an important guide in sentencing for historic offences is the maximum penalty and the objective gravity of the offending. At the time of this offending, a mandatory sentence of penal servitude for life applied to the offence of murder. For murders in the worst category, parole might never be granted. In this case, the objective gravity of the offending was significant in that the murder was committed for the purpose of avoiding being identified by the deceased as the perpetrator of the sexual assault upon her. Her unit was set alight with the intention of burning her body and other evidence connecting the applicant to the offences.
	
	
	The applicant was one week away from his eighteenth birthday and accordingly, a juvenile at the time of the offending. As his Honour appreciated, s 442 of the Crimes Act applied. His Honour also appreciated that the applicant was precluded from relying on his youth to its fullest extent because of the closeness of his age to 18 and because at the time of the offence he conducted himself as an adult. Consideration also had to be given to the time lapse which proceeded directly from the applicant’s concealment of his crime. The delay in prosecution was in no way attributable to any inaction on the part of the authorities.
	
	
	The sentence actually imposed on the applicant was not outside the range of sentences for such a serious offence, even when taking into account the applicant’s age at the time. This is so even when regard is had to the statistics before his Honour which indicated that a head sentence of 20 years was towards the higher end of sentences imposed on juveniles for murder. It also needs to be kept in mind that the concurrency of the sentence for the sexual offending involved a considerable degree of leniency which favoured the applicant.
	
	
	In Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 the plurality (French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ) said:
	


“54   In Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa, Simpson J accurately identified the proper use of information about sentences that have been passed in other cases. As her Honour pointed out, a history of sentencing can establish a range of sentences that have in fact been imposed. That history does not establish that the range is the correct range, or that the upper or lower limits to the range are the correct upper and lower limits. As her Honour said: ""Sentencing patterns are, of course, of considerable significance in that they result from the application of the accumulated experience and wisdom of first instance judges and of appellate courts."" But the range of sentences that have been imposed in the past does not fix ""the boundaries within which future judges must, or even ought, to sentence"". Past sentences ""are no more than historical statements of what has happened in the past. They can, and should, provide guidance to sentencing judges, and to appellate courts, and stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence"" (emphasis added). When considering past sentences, ""it is only by examination of the whole of the circumstances that have given rise to the sentence that 'unifying principles' may be discerned"".

55   As the plurality said in Wong:

""[R]ecording what sentences have been imposed in other cases is useful if, but only if, it is accompanied by an articulation of what are to be seen as the unifying principles which those disparate sentences may reveal. The production of bare statistics about sentences that have been passed tells the judge who is about to pass sentence on an offender very little that is useful if the sentencing judge is not also told why those sentences were fixed as they were.""”


	
	In the instant case, the maximum penalty of life imprisonment for murder has not altered from the time of the offences. Notwithstanding that a lesser sentence than penal servitude for life could be imposed pursuant to s 442 of the Crimes Act, the principles in relation to the limited use the court can make of statistics during the sentencing process remains relevant.
	
	
	In submissions the Crown relied upon the decision of Bradley v The Queen [2017] VSCA 69. One of the grounds of appeal in that case was in similar terms to Ground 2. The facts also were similar. In 2015 the offender was convicted of the 1983 murder of a 14 year old girl. The offender was then aged 21 years. The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 27 years with a non-parole period of 21 years. The history of sentencing practice in Victoria is similar to that in New South Wales in that before 1986 a mandatory life sentence applied for murder. A life sentence could be commuted by the Parole Board by releasing offenders after a period of imprisonment. In 1986 mandatory life sentences were abolished. The offender sought to rely upon statistics for 1987 and 1988 showing the average head sentence for murder to be between 16 and 19 years. The Victorian Court of Appeal accepted the Crown submission that the sentencing judge was entitled to conclude (as did his Honour in the present case) that sentencing statistics for 1987 – 1988 were of no real assistance and that the use of bare statistics of that kind had only limited value in any event (Bradley at [64] – [67]).
	
	
	Having found as he was entitled to do that the statistics placed before him were of little assistance and that accordingly a relevant sentencing pattern or practice had not been established, his Honour’s exercise of the sentencing discretion was conventional and in accordance with authority. His Honour followed the approach and applied the principles in Magnuson v R, RL v R and MPB v R. His Honour had regard to the maximum penalty, the place in the range of objective gravity occupied by the offence, that the sentence must adequately reflect the criminality of the offending, as well as having regard to the statements of principle in the five generally similar cases to which he referred. His Honour had due regard to the applicant’s age but also had appropriate regard to the adult nature of the offending. It is clear by reference to current sentencing practices that the sentence imposed by his Honour was modest and had been appropriately adjusted downwards by his Honour.
	
	
	Ground of Appeal 2 has not been made out.
	
	
	In relation to Ground 3, it is clear that in finding that there were no special circumstances, his Honour did not refer to past sentencing practices. It is also clear that past sentencing practices can be relevant to a finding of whether or not special circumstances exist. In MPB Garling J (with whom Hulme AJ agreed) said:
	


93   This Court has held that when sentences were imposed when the Parole of Prisoners Act 1966 (NSW) was in operation (as it was at the time of the offences in counts 1 to 4), the non-parole periods imposed were usually in the order of one-third to one-half of the head sentence: See: AJB v R [2007] NSWCCA 51 at [36]; GRD v R [2009] NSWCCA 149 at [20]; and BP v R; R v BP [2010] NSWCCA 303 at [154]-[156]. This is factor that a sentencing judge should take into account in considering whether there are special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).”


	
	What is of significance in this case, however, is that nowhere in the oral or written submissions made on behalf of the applicant in the sentence proceedings before Fagan J, did counsel submit that his Honour should find special circumstances. In particular, no submission was made to the effect that more lenient sentences were passed in the 1980s so that generally speaking lower non-parole periods were imposed and that this was a matter which was relevant to whether special circumstances should be found. In those circumstances, it is difficult to successfully argue that his Honour fell into error because he did not do that which he was never asked to do. In that regard, the observations of Johnson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Rothman J agreed) in Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [80] – [81] are pertinent. In particular, in sentencing appeals, this Court is reviewing the exercise of a discretionary judgment and not rehearing a plea in mitigation. An appeal of this kind is not the occasion for the revision and reformulation of the case presented below.
	
	
	It is true that the written submissions of counsel for the applicant in the sentence proceedings refer to MPB v R. However, that reference was limited to a statement of general principle by Basten JA. In particular his Honour’s attention was not drawn to the observation of Garling J at [93] of that case. In any event, neither MPB nor other authorities on this issue are authority for the proposition that the existence of shorter non-parole periods at the time offences were committed mandates or compels a commensurate variation in the application of s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	The fact that these matters were not drawn to his Honour’s attention and that no submissions were made in relation to them has not resulted in a miscarriage of justice which would entitle this Court to re-examine those matters and resentence the applicant to a lesser non-parole period. As was correctly conceded by the applicant and, as the authorities to which reference has already been made make clear, the sentence imposed must adequately reflect the criminality of the offence whenever the offence was committed. The non-parole period which is imposed must represent the minimum period which was required to be served by an offender having regard to all the purposes of punishment, including deterrence. In the circumstances of this case, I would not be prepared to find that a minimum term of imprisonment of less than 15 years was appropriate to comprehend the seriousness of the offending.
	
	
	Ground 3 has not been made out.
	


Ground 4 – The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to assess the applicant’s moral culpability for the offences taking into account his deprived upbringing: Bugmy v R [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571; Ingrey v R [2016] NSWCCA 31


	
	The applicant submitted that his Honour accepted that he was raised in circumstances of abuse and deprivation and that the mental, sexual and physical abuse at home was the cause of his substance abuse and feelings of depression in 1987 and 1988. The applicant submitted that in those circumstances the principles enunciated in Bugmy v R applied, i.e. that his exposure to extreme violence in circumstances of social deprivation in childhood explained his offending behaviour so that his moral culpability was reduced.
	
	
	The applicant relied upon the judgment of the plurality (French CJ, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ) where their Honours said:
	


“44   Because the effects of profound childhood deprivation do not diminish with the passage of time and repeated offending, it is right to speak of giving ""full weight"" to an offender's deprived background in every sentencing decision. However, this is not to suggest, as the appellant's submissions were apt to do, that an offender's deprived background has the same (mitigatory) relevance for all of the purposes of punishment. Giving weight to the conflicting purposes of punishment is what makes the exercise of the discretion so difficult. An offender's childhood exposure to extreme violence and alcohol abuse may explain the offender's recourse to violence when frustrated such that the offender's moral culpability for the inability to control that impulse may be substantially reduced. However, the inability to control the violent response to frustration may increase the importance of protecting the community from the offender.”


	
	In relation to that last consideration, the applicant submitted that his Honour had specifically found that there was little risk of him reoffending so that the protection of the community was not a matter which should operate to reduce the mitigatory effect of his deprived upbringing.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that his Honour erred in failing to make any assessment of his moral culpability by reference to his deprived background. He submitted that an atmosphere where criminal activity included sexual abuse, was likely to distort his moral compass, particularly when he was so exposed as a young person. The applicant submitted that his sexual abuse was at the hands of different perpetrators and extended to repeated brutality and deprivation at the hands of his father. On that issue, the applicant relied upon what was said in Ingrey v R (Hoeben CJ at CL with whom Adams and Fullerton JJ agreed):
	


“39   … The applicant’s background was considerably better than that described in Bugmy, Fernando and a number of similar cases which have come before the courts. Nevertheless, the applicant’s exposure to crime at an early age would still have “compromise[d] the person’s capacity to mature and learn from experience” (Bugmy at [43]).”


	
	The applicant submitted that this was a relevant consideration to be taken into account by his Honour in the assessment of his moral culpability and on the question of whether the crime was indeed “adult” in nature. The applicant submitted that when regard is had to the factor of the applicant’s deprived background and the application of Bugmy v R, a lesser sentence was warranted in law.
	


Consideration


	
	When considering this ground of appeal, it is important to note the findings which his Honour actually made on this issue. His Honour found that during 1987 and 1988 the applicant and his sister had to “provide for ourselves” because their father denied them food at home. This led to the applicant working “odd jobs up the golf course in the golf range” during 1987 and 1988 to help pay for food. His Honour found that in his teens and up to the date when the offences were committed, the applicant was athletic and active, playing cricket and rugby league in season, and engaging in surfboard riding all year round. His father inflicted corporal punishment on the offender frequently for little or no cause. He suffered “mental abuse” from his father involving ridicule. At times his father was uncaring and locked the household refrigerator, depriving the children of free access to it. On the other hand the applicant’s stepmother was loving, warm and caring. The applicant came in contact with a paternal uncle, who lived in Sydney, who also inflicted corporal punishment on him on occasions.
	
	
	In relation to sexual offending, his Honour accepted that on two occasions the uncle did sexually abuse him. There was no evidence of sexual abuse in the home. His Honour specifically rejected the applicant’s evidence that he was regularly sexually abused by the two neighbours, Kevin Haywood and Ronald Jolley. There was no suggestion that he was ever sexually abused by his father.
	
	
	When one compares that upbringing with the circumstances surrounding the upbringing of the offenders in Bugmy v R, Munda v Western Australia [2013] HCA 38; 249 CLR 600 and even the less extreme circumstances which surrounded the offender in Ingrey v R, the applicant has failed to establish a background and upbringing which could be properly characterised as amounting to deprivation. Specifically, there was no sexual abuse at home and there was no real link established between his use of marijuana, LSD and alcohol on weekends and his upbringing.
	
	
	While the applicant experienced a difficult and unfortunate upbringing, there was no evidence of the sort of “extreme violence and social deprivation” to which Bugmy and Munda were exposed. Their histories involved being raised in circumstances of extreme physical and mental violence surrounded by alcohol and drug abuse. There was a clear link between that kind of upbringing and the offences for which they were to be sentenced. Similarly, in the case of Ingrey his background during his formative years involved exposure to persons who were active in the criminal world and there was a general acceptance among the members of his wider family and peers that breaking the law was acceptable. The link between his offending and his upbringing was clear and compelling so as to be relevant to his moral culpability for that offending.
	
	
	Such is not the case with the applicant. The cruel and uncaring treatment of him by his father and the two occasions when he was apparently sexually abused by his uncle, do not explain either his substance abuse or his sexual assault and murder of the deceased. In a number of other respects the applicant’s upbringing was quite normal, i.e. that of a normal schoolboy who was an enthusiastic participant in sports, in circumstances where, at least to some extent, the uncaring conduct of his father was balanced by the loving support of his stepmother.
	
	
	The applicant has failed to link the commission of the offences to the unfortunate events in his upbringing. That upbringing itself when compared to the circumstances in the cases upon which the applicant relies was significantly better. Even if the applicant’s difficulties at home were taken at their highest, it is difficult to see why his moral culpability for beating, raping and strangling the deceased into unconsciousness and then leaving her to die after setting fire to her unit, should be reduced by anything arising from his childhood nor could his upbringing excuse this behaviour.
	
	
	Moreover, the fact that the applicant had only one conviction (for stealing) before these offences is an indication that his moral compass was not so compromised by the difficulties in his upbringing as to attract the application of the principles in Bugmy v R; Munda v Western Australia and Ingrey v R.
	
	
	This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Ground 5 – The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to hold and take into account as a matter of mitigation in his determination of sentence that the applicant was a person to be regarded as a person of good character (s 21A(3)(f) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.


	
	The applicant submitted that at the time of the offending he was a person of good character. The only offence which had then occurred was a single offence of stealing for which a conviction was recorded in May 1988, i.e. four months before these offences. The applicant submitted that in those circumstances, his Honour should have taken into account his prior good character as at 1988 when determining an appropriate sentence for the offences.
	
	
	The applicant submitted that despite his subsequent criminal history, his honour should have held that at the time of the offence and for the purposes of s 21A(3)(f) the applicant was a person of prior good character. He submitted that his Honour should also have found that despite the minor matters on the applicant’s record, he had become relevantly rehabilitated in that there had been no repetition of any violent offending. The applicant submitted that his Honour had erred in failing to take into account in the applicant’s favour his previous good character at the time of the offending and that there had not been any offences of violence since these offences.
	


Consideration


	
	The applicant’s counsel made no submissions in the sentence proceedings that the applicant was a person of prior good character and that that fact should be taken into account as a mitigating factor. No character evidence was called on his behalf. It was for the applicant to establish good character on the balance of probabilities. As with Ground 3, the observations of this Court in Zreika v R have application – i.e. the applicant should be bound by the way he put his case in the sentence proceedings.
	
	
	In respect of the applicant’s character, the focus in the sentence proceedings was primarily on his previous conviction for stealing which his Honour accepted was committed at a time when the applicant and his sister had to provide for themselves. His Honour’s findings as to the applicant’s character were:
	


“61   The offender’s record, which commenced nearly 9 years after the crimes for which he is now before the Court, is not a material factor in determining an appropriate sentence. On the one hand, the record does not include any significant offences of violence nor any sexual offences at all. It could not be said against Alexis Katsis that his conduct subsequent to September 1988 has demonstrated any heightened requirement for specific deterrence with respect to crimes of this nature or that future protection of the community is a pressing consideration.

62   On the other hand, nor could it be said that the offender has since September 1988 lived an exemplary or blameless life which might be regarded as having redeemed in any degree his grave crimes of September 1988. The subsequent record does not attract lenience. It is essentially neutral.”


	
	While good character must be taken into account in mitigation of penalty, that proposition can be affected by the nature of the offence. In R v Kennedy [2000] NSWCCA 527 the Court (Simpson and Howie JJ) said:
	


“21 It is unnecessary for the purposes of determining this appeal to consider the circumstances in which a court may legitimately determine that it will give less weight to prior good character as a mitigating factor. Generally speaking such a situation might arise where general deterrence is important, the particular offence before the court is serious and it is one frequently committed by persons of good character. Another situation may be where the prior good character of the offender has enabled him or her to gain a position where the particular offence can be committed.”


	
	In this case general deterrence was a matter of considerable importance and the circumstances of the offending involved an extremely high level of objective criminality. Those considerations would have entitled his Honour to give little or no weight to the applicant’s prior good character even if the matter had been raised, as it should have been, in the sentence proceedings.
	
	
	In relation to the applicant’s post offending conduct, his Honour was entitled to treat it in the way in which he did given the findings which he made, that it was essentially neutral. It could certainly not be said that the applicant had subsequently become a person of good character just because he had not repeated the episode of murder and violence which the offending involved. In any event, the submission that following the offences the applicant “had never committed a crime of any violence” is not correct. The applicant had been convicted of common assault in 1998 for which he was sentenced to the rising of the court and again in 2000 for which he was fined $1,000.
	
	
	This ground of appeal has not been made out.
	


Proposed orders


	
	The orders which I propose are:
	



	
	Leave to appeal against sentence is granted.
	
	
	The appeal is dismissed.

Yong Pung How CJ:
1          The appellant pleaded guilty before District Judge Wong Keen Onn in the District Court to one charge of having carnal intercourse against the order of nature under s 377 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed), and was sentenced to 24 months’ imprisonment.
2          The charge against the appellant is set out below:
You, Annis bin Abdullah, Male/27 years old, NRIC No. S/7616484/C, are charged that you, on or about the 23
rd
 day of April 2002, at about 10.00pm, at Chinese Garden Road, Singapore, had carnal intercourse against the order of nature with [the victim], female 16 years old, DOB 16 April 1986, to wit, by engaging in the act of fellatio with [the victim] and you have thereby committed an offence under section 377 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.
3          The statement of facts presented by the Prosecution also stated that the victim was 16 years old at the time of the offence.
4          After the appellant was sentenced, it was discovered that the victim was only 15 years old at the time of the offence and that the Prosecution had made an error when preparing the charge and the statement of facts. The Public Prosecutor brought an application for criminal revision pursuant to s 268 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“CPC”), seeking an amendment of the charge and of the statement of facts to reflect the true age of the victim at the time of the offence.
5          The appellant appealed against his sentence on the ground that it was manifestly excessive. He also filed a motion for leave to adduce fresh evidence at the hearing of his appeal.
6          I heard the appeal, the motion and the petition for criminal revision on 17 February 2004. At the end of the hearing before me, I granted the petition for criminal revision. I dismissed the motion and allowed the appeal against sentence. I now give my reasons.
Background facts
7          In March 2002, the appellant met the victim online in an Internet Relay Chat (“IRC”) chatroom. They subsequently met at a barbecue gathering hosted by a mutual friend for Internet enthusiasts. After this meeting, the appellant and the victim kept in touch by way of telephone and IRC chatroom conversations. The victim later initiated a date with the appellant.
8          This date took place on 23 April 2002. At about 9.30pm that day, the appellant met the victim at the Jurong Entertainment Centre and the victim suggested that they go for a drive in the appellant’s car. The appellant drove to Chinese Garden Road and parked his car there. The appellant and the victim remained in the car and they eventually became intimate. The appellant asked the victim whether she wanted to have sexual intercourse with him, but she indicated that she did not wish to do so. The accused then asked the victim to fellate him and she agreed. She performed fellatio until the appellant ejaculated and the appellant then drove her home.
9          The appellant and the victim did not meet again. The victim was later encouraged by friends to make a police report about this incident and a police report was lodged on 1 May 2002.
10        The appellant was 25 years old at the time of the offence. He was a police sergeant attached to the Police Coast Guard.
The decision below
11        The district judge noted that the Court of Appeal had established in 
PP v Kwan Kwong Weng
 
[1997] 1 SLR 697
 that fellatio performed as a substitute for natural sexual intercourse constituted an offence under s 377 of the Penal Code. The district judge noted that the appellant had admitted to all the essential ingredients of the offence and convicted him accordingly.
12        In sentencing the appellant, the district judge noted that the appellant had sought out the teenage victim 
via
 the Internet to satisfy his lustful desires. In addition, the district judge was of the view that there were several aggravating factors present in this case, including the following:
(a)        The appellant was a mature adult some ten years older than the victim;
(b)        The victim was a teenager attending secondary school;
(c)        The appellant had used the Internet as a medium to meet the victim and to engage in a criminal act which contributed to the victim’s moral corruption; and
(d)        The appellant was a serving police sergeant in the Singapore Police Force when he committed the offence.
13        The district judge also took into account a number of mitigating circumstances in the appellant’s favour. The district judge noted that the appellant was a first offender and had pleaded guilty at the first opportunity. The district judge also noted that the appellant did not use trickery or force to coerce the victim into performing the act of fellatio.
14        On balance, the district judge was of the view that the aggravating factors in the present case outweighed the mitigating factors such that a substantial custodial sentence was justified. In light of this, the district judge imposed a sentence of 24 months’ imprisonment on the appellant.
The petition for criminal revision
15        I now turn to the Public Prosecutor’s petition for criminal revision.
Principles of revision
16        The revisionary powers of the High Court are conferred by s 23 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 1999 Rev Ed) and s 268 of the CPC. Section 268 of the CPC provides that the High Court may, in an application for criminal revision, exercise, 
inter alia
, its powers under s 256 of the CPC.
17        Section 256 provides, 
inter alia
, that:
At the hearing of the appeal the court may, if it considers there is no sufficient ground for interfering, dismiss the appeal or may —
(a)        …
(b)        in an appeal from a conviction —
(i)         reverse the finding and sentence and acquit or discharge the accused or order him to be retried by a court of competent jurisdiction or committed for trial;
(ii)        alter the finding, maintaining the sentence, or, with or without altering the finding, reduce or enhance the sentence; or
(iii)       with or without the reduction or enhancement and with or without altering the finding, alter the nature of the sentence;
(c)        …
(d)        …
Whether the High Court’s revisionary powers include the power to amend the charge and the statement of facts
18        It is established law that the High Court’s powers under s 256(b) of the CPC include the power to amend a charge and consequently convict an accused person on the amended charge: 
Garmaz s/o Pakhar v PP
 
[1996] 1 SLR 401
. The Court of Appeal noted in 
Garmaz
, however, that such power is not unlimited and has to be exercised with great caution and not to the prejudice of the accused. The Court of Appeal further held that the test laid down by Cussen J in 
Ng Ee v PP
 [1941] 1 MLJ 180 was applicable in this regard. In 
Ng Ee v PP
, Cussen J stated at 181 that the power to amend a charge on appeal was:
… a power to be exercised with great caution, and only where it is clear beyond all doubt, from the nature of the offence and the record of evidence in the case, that to do so can in no way prejudice the case of the accused; it must be clear that … the proceedings at the trial would have taken the same course, and the evidence recorded been the same – that the [Prosecution’s] evidence would have been unchanged (substantially) and the accused’s defence the same.
19        In 
PP v Koon Seng Construction Pte Ltd
 
[1996] 1 SLR 573
 at 579, [21], I stated, in the context of the court’s revisionary powers to amend a charge to which the accused person had pleaded guilty, that:
The power of amendment is clearly not unfettered. It should be exercised sparingly, subject to careful observance of the safeguards against prejudice to the defence … The court must be satisfied that the proceedings below would have taken the same course, and the evidence recorded would have been the same. The primary consideration is that the amendment will not cause any injustice, or affect the presentation of the evidence, in particular, the accused’s defence. These safeguards must be rigorously observed.
20        I should highlight here that the Public Prosecutor was applying to amend not only the charge, but also the statement of facts. Thus, the issue before me was whether the High Court’s powers under s 256(b) of the CPC include the power to amend the statement of facts.
21        I was of the view that the High Court’s powers under s 256(b) of the CPC were sufficiently broad to encompass the power to amend the statement of facts. In 
Garmaz
, the Court of Appeal took pains to reject a strict and literal construction of s 256(b) of the CPC, holding at [28] that:
[S]uch a construction would lead to incongruous results: on the one hand the court by that section is given extensive powers in respect of conviction, sentence and findings, and yet on the other it has no power to amend the charge, and the consequence of this is that it has no power even to correct any errors appearing in the charge. Such a position is untenable. Further, the High Court has the revisionary powers under ss 266–268 of the CPC. In view of these extensive express powers, 
it is inconceivable that it was the intention of the legislature that the High Court, in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, should not have the power to amend the charge preferred against the accused and set the record straight. A more purposive construction should in our view be adopted.
[emphasis added]
22        While I noted that the question that was before the Court of Appeal in 
Garmaz
 related to the charge preferred against the accused, and not the statement of facts, I was of the view that a purposive construction of s 256(b) of the CPC should be adopted. This is because, following the Court of Appeal’s decision in 
Mok Swee Kok v PP
 
[1994] 3 SLR 140
, it is clear that the court has a legal duty to record a statement of facts and to scrutinise it to ensure that all the elements of the charge are made out therein. In light of this, I did not feel that the drafters of the CPC could have intended that the court should not have the power to amend the statement of facts. I was of the view that it must have been the legislature’s intention that the court should have such a power so that it is able to accurately record the relevant facts which must be taken into account when determining sentence.
23        For the avoidance of doubt, I should state that an amendment to the statement of facts should only be made where the safeguards set out in 
Koon Seng Construction
 and 
Ng Ee
 are observed.
Whether the High Court’s revisionary powers should be exercised in the present criminal revision
24        It is established law that the High Court’s powers of revision must be exercised sparingly. The principles governing revision were laid down in 
Ang Poh Chuan v PP
 
[1996] 1 SLR 326
, where it was held at 330, [17] that:
[V]arious phrases may be used to identify the circumstances which would attract the exercise of the revisionary jurisdiction, but they all share the common denominator that there must be some serious injustice. Of course there cannot be a precise definition of what would constitute such serious injustice for that would in any event unduly circumscribe what must be a wide discretion vested in the court, the exercise of which would depend largely on the particular facts. But generally it must be shown that there is something palpably wrong in the decision that strikes at its basis as an exercise of judicial power by the court below.
25        In respect of a conviction under s 377 of the Penal Code, the age of the victim is irrelevant as an offence is made out regardless of the victim’s age. The victim’s age is, however, a critical factor which the court must take into account for the purposes of sentencing. In this regard, the Public Prosecutor submitted that public policy necessitated that underage victims, 
ie
 those below the age of 16 years, must be protected from sexual predators. I was of the view that the relative difference in age between the victim and the accused, as well as the victim’s actual age, were both critical and relevant to the court’s assessment of sentence.
26        I have stated on many occasions that there is no clear-cut test of what constitutes “serious injustice”: see, for example, 
Ng Kim Han v PP
 
[2001] 2 SLR 293
 at [10]. However, on the present facts, there was little doubt that serious injustice would be caused if the appellant were to be sentenced on the basis that the victim was 16 years old, as stated in the charge and the statement of facts as initially drafted. This is because the age of the victim is a significant factor in sentencing under s 377 of the Penal Code, particularly where the victim’s consent is presented to the court as a mitigating factor, as was the case here. I was of the view that the fact that the victim in the present case was below the age of 16 years was highly significant as the clear policy of Parliament has been to criminalise sexual activity involving girls below the age of 16 years. Section 140(1)(i) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353, 1997 Rev Ed), for example, makes it an offence to have carnal connection with any girl below the age of 16 years except by way of marriage. An offence is made out under s 140(1)(i) of the Women’s Charter regardless of whether the victim consented to the act of carnal connection, on the basis that girls below the age of 16 years are incapable of legally consenting to sexual activity: 
Tay Kim Kuan v PP
 
[2001] 3 SLR 567
 at [13].
27        I was of the view that the misunderstanding as to the victim’s true age would indeed suggest that there was something “palpably wrong” in the district judge’s assessment of sentence. I have previously held that the High Court’s revisionary powers exist to facilitate its supervisory and superintending jurisdiction over criminal proceedings before a subordinate court so as to correct a miscarriage of justice arising from the correctness, legality or propriety of any finding, sentence or order recorded or passed: 
Koh Thian Huat v PP
 
[2002] 3 SLR 28
 at [16].
28        I was therefore of the view that the present circumstances clearly justified the exercise of the High Court’s revisionary powers and I ordered that the charge and the statement of facts be amended to reflect that the victim was 15 years old at the time of the offence.
The motion to adduce additional evidence
29        Before addressing the appellant’s appeal against sentence proper, I turn now to consider the appellant’s motion to adduce additional evidence at the hearing of the appeal. The appellant asserted that the fresh evidence would show that the district judge erred in imposing a deterrent sentence on the appellant.
30        In support of this contention, the appellant filed an affidavit which purportedly showed the following:
(a)        The appellant did not get acquainted with the victim through the Internet;
(b)        It was the victim who first initiated contact with the appellant a month after they had met at the barbecue function; and
(c)        The victim had obtained the appellant’s mobile phone number from a mutual friend and the appellant had only met up with the victim after she had called him several times.
31        The relevant principles governing the court’s grant of leave to adduce additional evidence on appeal are found in 
Juma’at bin Samad v PP
 
[1993] 3 SLR 338
, where I applied the test set out by Denning LJ in 
Ladd v Marshall
 [1954] 3 All ER 745. The 
Ladd v Marshall
 test requires that all of the following three conditions are satisfied before the reception of fresh evidence can be justified:
(a)        Non-availability: it must be shown that the evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial;
(b)        Relevance: the evidence must be such that, if given at trial, it would probably have an important influence on the result of the case, although it need not be decisive; and
(c)        Reliability: the evidence must be such as is presumably to be believed or in other words, it must be apparently credible, although it need not be incontrovertible.
32        
Juma’at
 is therefore clear authority for the proposition that an application to introduce fresh evidence will only be allowed in extremely limited circumstances and only where the evidence is relevant, reliable and was not available at trial.
33        I was of the view that the appellant’s application to introduce the fresh evidence should not be allowed as it did not satisfy the 
Ladd v Marshall
 test adopted in 
Juma’at
.
34        The appellant asserted in his affidavit that an “in depth detailed complex analysis” of his computer would reveal that he did not get acquainted with the victim through the Internet or though the IRC chatroom. However, this was a bare assertion and the appellant made no attempt to conduct such an analysis of his computer or to explain why the analysis would indicate that he did not meet the victim 
via
 the Internet. There was thus no question that the third condition of reliability was not satisfied. In fact, the reliability of this evidence was all the more suspect when I took into account the appellant’s statement in his affidavit that his computer was “totally non-functional” when it was returned after investigations by the police.
35        On a separate note, I was rather puzzled that the appellant was seeking to assert that he did not meet the victim through the Internet or the IRC chatroom as this was wholly contrary to what was stated in the statement of facts to which he had admitted without qualification. The statement of facts provided, 
inter alia
, that:
Investigations disclosed that in March 2002, the complainant got to know the accused in the Internet Relay Chat (IRC) chatroom. Subsequently, they met at a barbecue function which was organised by a mutual friend at Pasir Ris. After their first meeting, the complainant and the accused kept in touch through the telephone and chatroom.
36        Similarly unreliable was the appellant’s assertion that one “Yusnam”, a mutual friend of the victim and the appellant, could confirm that it was the victim who had initiated contact with the appellant after she had seen him at the barbecue function. An affidavit from Yusnam was not filed. The appellant stated that Yusnam was not contactable when the appellant was sentenced below, but this did not explain why an affidavit from Yusnam had not been provided in support of the appellant’s motion.
37        Finally, the appellant appended the call tracing records of the mobile phone he had been using from February to April 2002. These records were appended to show that the appellant only met up with the victim after she had called him four times. This evidence was clearly available at the time of the trial as the appellant could have obtained the call tracing records from his mobile phone service provider then. The appellant asserted that he did not know, at the time he was sentenced, that the call tracing records would assist his case as he had forgotten the victim’s telephone number. The appellant alleged that his wife had come up with the idea to find the victim’s telephone number using her father’s name only 
after
 the appellant was sentenced. There was little doubt that this additional evidence would have been available for production at trial had reasonable diligence been exercised by the appellant. The condition of non-availability was therefore not satisfied.
38        Further, in respect of the call tracing records, the condition of relevance was also not met. In my view, it was highly unlikely that a finding that the victim had indeed called the appellant before the offence would have affected the district judge’s decision to impose a deterrent sentence. The principal factors relied upon by the district judge in imposing a deterrent sentence were that the appellant, who was a police officer some ten years older than the victim, had used the Internet as a means to meet the victim and that this meeting subsequently led to unnatural sexual intercourse. Evidence that the victim had called the appellant before the offence was committed would not be inconsistent with these factors. Indeed, the district judge’s observation that the appellant had “actively procured and participated in the commission of the offence” would remain valid even if it could be shown that the victim had called the appellant before the offence was committed, since the undisputed facts are that the appellant had brought the victim to Chinese Garden Road and asked for sex in his car. When she declined, he asked the victim to fellate him instead.
39        I therefore dismissed the appellant’s motion.
The appeal against sentence
40        I now turn to the appeal against sentence. The appellant appealed against his sentence on the grounds that it was manifestly excessive.
41        In support of this contention, the appellant submitted that the district judge failed to give sufficient weight to the following mitigating factors:
(a)        The act of fellatio was consensual and the appellant did not use trickery or force to coerce the victim into fellating him;
(b)        The appellant is a first offender;
(c)        The appellant pleaded guilty at the first opportunity and co-operated with the authorities; and
(d)        There were exceptional ill-effects on the appellant’s personal and family circumstances.
42        The appellant made further contentions relating to the aggravating factors relied on by the district judge. Specifically, the appellant contended that the district judge had erred in finding that the appellant had sought the victim 
via
 the Internet with a view to satisfying his lustful desires. The appellant also argued that the district judge erred in placing too much weight on the fact that the appellant’s actions led to the moral corruption of the victim. The appellant contended that the district judge had erred in finding that a deterrent sentence was warranted on the present facts as the appellant had committed the offence outside the scope of his duties as a police officer.
43        Finally, the appellant submitted that the sentence imposed on the appellant by the district judge was not in line with the sentences imposed in other similar cases.
44        I shall now consider these contentions in turn.
Whether the district judge failed to give sufficient weight to mitigating factors
The act of fellatio was consensual and the appellant did not use trickery or force to coerce the victim into fellating him
45        The appellant submitted that the district judge had failed to accord any mitigating weight to the fact that the victim had consented to the act of fellatio. In support of his contention that consent is a relevant factor which should have been taken into account in sentencing, the appellant cited pp 318 to 320 of the 
Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts
 (2nd Ed, 2003). At 319, it is stated that:
Apart from making a distinction in sentencing on the basis of the form of the unnatural carnal intercourse, the other relevant facts would be consent or the lack thereof and the age of the victim. There are three broad categories: (1) between consenting adults, (2) between non-consenting adults and (3) those committed on young children.
Offences between consenting adults would be viewed the least serious. …
As for ‘non-consenting’ adults, they can expect a substantial term of imprisonment. …
Where the victims are young, the principles of deterrence and the need to express society’s revulsion would dictate a lengthy custodial sentence.
46        The appellant argued that the present case should fall under the “consenting adults” category, as “young victims” are children below 14 years old. The appellant submitted that the Court of Appeal’s judgment in 
Lim Hock Hin Kelvin v PP
 
[1998] 1 SLR 801
 would support this position.
47        I was of the view that this submission was entirely without merit. The Court of Appeal in 
Lim Hock Hin Kelvin
 did not suggest, or even vaguely imply, that the court regards only victims under the age of 14 years as “young victims” whose consent is disregarded for the purposes of sentencing under s 377 of the Penal Code.
48        In 
Lim Hock Hin Kelvin
 at [20], the Court of Appeal observed, 
inter alia
, that:
[T]he starting position must be that where the victims are vulnerable children, the offence becomes much more serious and the punishment meted on such offenders has to reflect the gravity of the offence. The punishment for rape offences is much more serious where the victim is below 14 years and sexual intercourse takes place without her consent. Section 376(1) Penal Code provides that the maximum punishment for rape is imprisonment for life and the offender will also be liable to fine or to caning. Section 376(2) goes on to provide that the offender who commits rape by having sexual intercourse with a girl below 14 years of age without her consent is subject to a minimum punishment for a term of not less than eight years and shall be punished with caning with not less than 12 strokes. Even in England, it is still an offence to commit buggery on a boy aged below 16 years; the Wolfenden Report took the firm view of the necessity of protection of the young, despite the fact that it took the view that criminal law is not concerned with private morals or ethical means.
49        There is nothing in this extract which can be construed as saying that “vulnerable children” are those who are below 14 years of age. The age of 14 years is cited in respect of 
an example
 of an instance where the legislature has determined that children require special protection, specifically the statutory rape provisions in ss 375 and 376 of the Penal Code. The Court of Appeal did not say that 
only
 victims below 14 years of age are “vulnerable children” such that offences committed against them are more serious.
50        In my view, as a general guide, “young victims” should be those under 16 years of age. This would be consonant with the protection of young women under s 140(1)(i) of the Women’s Charter which was enacted on the basis that girls under the age of 16 are deemed to be incapable of giving valid consent to a sexual act. I was of the view that this principle should be extended to s 377 offences, such that in cases where the victim is under the age of 16 years, his or her consent is irrelevant for the purposes of sentencing. The underlying principle in this regard is that young girls under the age of 16 may not have the experience or the maturity to make decisions in their own best interests about their own sexuality and that the law must step in to prevent their exposure to sexual activity regardless of their purported consent.
51        The present case would fall under this category of cases and the fact that the victim had agreed to the act of fellatio should not be accorded mitigating weight.
The appellant is a first offender
52        The appellant argued that the district judge had erred in placing no mitigatory weight on the fact that the appellant was a first offender with no previous convictions or antecedents.
53        I saw little merit to the appellant’s argument. The district judge explicitly stated in his grounds of decision that he had been mindful that the appellant was a first offender.
54        In any case, the fact that the appellant was a first offender, while relevant, must be considered alongside other factors, including any aggravating factors against him. This was the approach I adopted in 
Sim Gek Yong v PP
 
[1995] 1 SLR 537
 at 541, [9]:
Like any other personal factor put forward on the accused’s behalf in mitigation, the absence of similar antecedents is something to be taken into account by the sentencing court and weighed in the balance against other, possibly opposing, factors. The first and foremost consideration in this balancing process, however, must be the public interest. Any sentence imposed must be such that it enables our criminal law not merely to punish crime effectively but also to prevent it.
The appellant pleaded guilty at the first opportunity and co-operated with the authorities
55        The appellant submitted that the appellant’s plea of guilt should have been afforded more mitigatory weight by the district judge, particularly as the appellant was not arrested in circumstances in which the Prosecution would have had no difficulty in proving the charge against him. The appellant pointed out that, had the matter gone to trial, the Prosecution would have had to rely almost exclusively on the victim’s evidence. Thus, the appellant’s plea of guilt saved the victim the trauma of having to testify in court and consequently, relive her traumatic experience.
56        The Public Prosecutor was of the view that the appellant’s plea of guilt was of limited mitigating value and 
Lim Hock Hin Kelvin
 was cited in support of this.
57        I agreed with the appellant’s submission that on the present facts, the appellant’s plea of guilt was a significant mitigating factor which should be accorded due weight. I noted, however, that the district judge had taken the appellant’s plea of guilt into account during sentencing. In fact, the district judge not only stated that he was mindful that the appellant had pleaded guilty at the first opportunity but went on to observe that the appellant’s plea of guilt was a “sign of genuine remorse”.
58        That said, I should add that I was unconvinced by the Public Prosecutor’s submissions on this point. In 
Lim Hock Hin Kelvin
, I held that the protection of the public was an established exception to the general rule that the plea of guilt will entitle a convicted person to a discount of the sentence. In light of this, I declined to accord much weight to the guilty plea of the accused who had been convicted of several sex offences, including four charges under s 377 of the Penal Code.
59        However, in my view, the “public protection” exception applied in 
Lim Hock Hin Kelvin
 and in other cases like 
Fu Foo Tong v PP
 
[1995] 1 SLR 448
 applied with considerably less force in the present case. The accused in 
Lim Hock Hin Kelvin
 was a chronic paedophile who persistently targeted young children and used gifts to cajole and persuade them to engage in unnatural carnal intercourse. The offences were repeatedly committed over a period of time. The Court of Appeal therefore took the view that, in the interests of public protection, long-term incarceration was warranted.
60        In clear contrast, there was no evidence that the appellant in the present appeal is a paedophile. He was a first offender and did not resort to trickery to cajole the victim into performing the act of fellatio. Further, by pleading guilty, the appellant had indeed spared the victim the trauma of testifying in a contested trial. I was therefore of the view that his plea of guilt should be accorded due weight.
There were exceptional ill-effects on the appellant’s personal and family circumstances
61        The appellant submitted that his personal circumstances were very “exceptional” and “extreme” as his father passed away in 1997, leaving the appellant to support his aged mother and sister. He also pointed out that he had lost his job as a result of the conviction and had been forced to “grovel and beg” his friends and colleagues for financial assistance.
62        It is settled law that hardship caused to the appellant’s family as a result of the imprisonment of an offender has little mitigating value: 
Lai Oei Mui Jenny v PP
 
[1993] 3 SLR 305
 and 
PP v Tan Fook Sum
 
[1999] 2 SLR 523
. It is only in very exceptional or extreme circumstances that such hardship can be regarded as a legitimate factor in mitigating the sentence. Such circumstances were clearly absent in this case and I was utterly unconvinced that the district judge had erred in rejecting this as a mitigating factor in the present case.
Aggravating factors relied on by the district judge
63        I now turn to the appellant’s contentions which related to the aggravating factors relied on by the district judge.
Whether the district judge erred in finding that the appellant had sought the victim via the Internet with a view to satisfying his lustful desires and whether the appellant’s use of the Internet necessitated the imposition of a deterrent sentence
64        The appellant submitted that there was nothing in the statement of facts or mitigation plea which would suggest that the appellant had sought the victim 
via
 the Internet to satisfy his carnality. The appellant submitted that the district judge’s finding could not be substantiated and that a deterrent sentence was not warranted on the facts of the present case.
65        I accepted the appellant’s submission that the district judge’s observation that the appellant had “roam[ed] the internet to meet with and thereafter morally corrupt immature adolescent girls through acts of unnatural carnal intercourse” was an overstatement. Be that as it may, the critical issue that was before me was whether a deterrent sentence was warranted on the present facts.
66        The district judge held, on the basis of 
Tay Kim Kuan
 ([26] 
supra
), that where an offender uses the Internet as a medium to meet teenage girls to engage in criminal acts that corrupt their morals, that would be regarded as an aggravating factor. I was of the view that the district judge did not err in this regard. As I recently stated in 
Rupchand Bhojwani Sunil v PP
 
[2004] SGHC 17
 at [23]:
[T]he reasoning behind the deterrent sentence [in 
Tay Kim Kuan
] was the protection of the young and gullible from the perils of the Internet, in the form of unscrupulous people who hid their true identities and remained faceless while boldly preying on such young people.67     In 
Tay Kim Kuan
, the accused had met the 15-year-old victim in an IRC chatroom. The victim and the accused subsequently kept in touch by way of IRC and telephone conversations, and later engaged in sexual intercourse.
68        The prevailing concern in the present case is the same as that in 
Tay Kim Kuan
, which is to protect the young from the perils of the Internet and from the possibility of the Internet being abused, directly or indirectly, to facilitate the exploitation of young victims for sexual gratification. On the present facts, there was a clear nexus between the initial Internet contact and the commission of the offence, as the initial Internet contact very quickly led to the offence.
69        The appellant sought to persuade me that the initial Internet contact was merely a very remote link in the factual chain of events surrounding the offence, and that much of the interaction between the appellant and the victim had been by way of telephone conversations and in the meeting at the barbecue gathering. He was not an unscrupulous sex offender who had remained faceless to the victim, since they had subsequently met up and spoken on the telephone.
70        I was of the view that this did not take the appellant very far. Naturally, any initial contact in an Internet chatroom would have to result in a physical meeting before an unnatural sex offence could take place. The offender would obviously not be able to hide his true identity and remain faceless indefinitely. However, the crucial point here was that the Internet had facilitated the offence, as it provided an avenue for the appellant to get acquainted with the victim and to ask her, very quickly thereafter, to perform fellatio on him. The district judge was therefore not wrong in finding that a deterrent sentence was warranted.
71        I should, however, point out that while the courts will generally consider imposing a deterrent sentence where the initial contact between a sex offender and a victim is 
via
 the Internet, each case must be determined on its own facts. There may well be cases where the court may decide that a deterrent sentence is not appropriate, such as where the link between the Internet contact and the offence is overly remote.
Whether the district judge erred by placing too much weight on the aggravating factor that the appellant’s actions led to the moral corruption of the victim
72        The appellant argued that the district judge’s finding that the appellant’s actions led to the moral corruption of the victim was not supported by the statement of facts or mitigation plea and must be regarded as purely speculative. To buttress this contention, the appellant repeatedly stressed that the victim had voluntarily been physically intimate with the appellant and had even “groped his genital region of her own volition”.
73        I saw no merit in the appellant’s contention. It is undisputed that the appellant had asked the victim to perform the act of fellatio after she had declined to have sexual intercourse with him. Further, even if the victim was sexually experienced or promiscuous (and the appellant was unable to adduce any evidence in support of this), it is established law that this is wholly irrelevant in sentencing: 
Tay Kim Kuan.
74        The offender in 
Tay Kim Kuan
 had pleaded guilty to one charge under s 140(1)(i) of the Women’s Charter. His counsel, in contending that the sentence imposed by the trial judge was manifestly excessive, submitted that the victim had had a long history of sexual intercourse with older men and had tempted the appellant by sharing her lurid experiences with him. I rejected these submissions, observing at [17] that:
… I had no doubt that the complainant in the present case was no innocent virgin to begin with and admittedly, had had her fair share of sexual experiences before sleeping with the appellant. Nevertheless, the offence committed by the appellant with a girl just one-third his age remained a serious one for which the law provides no excuse. If the appellant was indeed anything as sensible and mature as his counsel made him out to be, then all the more he should have known better than to further the moral corruption of one whom he knew or thought was already debauched. Instead, he had no reservations about taking advantage of the easy opportunity which presented itself to him and exploited it fully to gratify his lust.
Whether the district judge erred in finding that a deterrent sentence was warranted because the appellant was a police officer
75        The appellant submitted that the district judge had erred in holding that a deterrent sentence was warranted because the appellant had been a police officer at the time of the offence. The appellant contended that in cases where the offender is a law enforcement officer, a deterrent sentence is warranted only where the offence is committed in the course of his duty.
76        It was clear that the district judge had regarded the fact that the appellant was a police officer at the time of the offence as a strong aggravating factor. The district judge cited 
PP v Gurmit Singh
 
[1999] 3 SLR 215
 in support of his view that a severe sentence was warranted to deter like-minded individuals and to uphold the public interest that those who are vested with the duty to uphold and enforce the law should not be let off lightly when they deliberately flout the law.
77        The appellant contended, however, that 
Gurmit Singh
 was only authority for the proposition that a deterrent sentence should be imposed where a law enforcement officer commits an offence 
in the course of his duties
. The appellant submitted that the holding in 
Gurmit Singh
 did not extend to cases where a law enforcement officer commits offences 
outside
 the scope of his official duties.
78        I was of the view that, while the public is entitled to expect the highest standards from the police force, the fact that the appellant was a police officer at the time of the offence should not have been regarded as an aggravating factor in the present case.
79        It could not be disputed that the offence was completely unrelated to the appellant’s status as a police officer. There was no evidence, for example, that the appellant sought to exploit his position as a police officer to coerce or pressure the victim to perform the act of fellatio. This stood in marked contrast with the facts of 
Gurmit Singh
, where a police corporal forged acknowledgement slips reflecting that he had returned exhibits of shoplifting cases investigated by him, when in actual fact he had retained the exhibits for his own use. The accused in 
Gurmit Singh
 clearly abused his position as an investigating officer in committing the offences of forgery and he violated the trust reposed in him to prosecute offences fairly and ethically.
80        Further, I made clear in 
Gurmit Singh
 that a deterrent sentence was necessary on the facts of the case because the accused had committed the forgery offences in the course of his duty. In this regard, I noted at [11] that:
In this case, it seemed clear to me that a deterrent sentence was warranted as the respondent had been a police officer 
who had committed these offences in the commission of his duty
. The public is entitled to expect the highest standards from the police force. It would be sending the wrong signals to the public if a police officer who had committed forgery got off with only a fine. [emphasis added]
81        I further noted at [17] that:
It seemed clear to me that in the circumstances of the case, 
where the accused was a police officer and had committed these offences in the course of his duty
, it was in the public interest that a committal sentence be given. The whole purpose of the law is to maintain order and discipline and it was left to police officers to enforce the law. A deterrent sentence ought to be given to the respondent in view of this aggravating factor. [emphasis added]
82        It was therefore my view that, in this case, the mere fact that the appellant had been a police officer should not have been regarded as an aggravating factor. While the courts will not hesitate to punish police officers who abuse their powers to commit offences, a deterrent sentence may not be warranted in cases where a police officer offends outside the scope of his official duties and does not abuse his position to commit criminal mischief.
Whether the sentence imposed on the appellant by the district judge was in line with the sentences imposed in other similar cases
83        Finally, I turn to consider whether the sentence imposed by the district judge was in line with the sentences imposed in similar cases.
84        In sentencing the appellant, the district judge relied on three cases – 
PP v Wong Siu Fai
 
[2002] 3 SLR 276
, 
Adam bin Darsin v PP
 
[2001] 2 SLR 412
 and 
PP v Peh Thian Hui
 
[2002] 3 SLR 268
 – in which sentences of five years’ imprisonment were imposed for s 377 offences. The district judge also considered 
PP v Pok Raymond
 
[2003] SGHC 18
 where sentences of two years’ imprisonment were imposed in respect of each of three s 377 charges preferred against the accused.
85        The district judge was of the view that, following 
Adam bin Darsin
, an appropriate sentence for an offence of unnatural carnal intercourse by way of fellatio would be in the region of five years, subject to any mitigating or aggravating circumstances that may be present.
86        As both the appellant and the Public Prosecutor made submissions on this issue, it would be useful to summarise their submissions at this juncture and I now proceed to do so.
The appellant’s submissions
87        The key contention advanced by the appellant was that the sentence imposed by the district judge was manifestly excessive as it was not in line with the sentences imposed in other cases involving offences under s 377 of the Penal Code and s 140(1)(i) of the Women’s Charter.
88        One of the cases cited by the appellant was 
PP v Netto Michael George
 
[2000] SGHC 261
. In 
Netto Michael George
, the accused was charged with a number of sex offences, including aggravated rape, unnatural carnal intercourse by way of fellatio and aggravated outrage of modesty. He was also charged with one count of housebreaking by night. The accused had raped the victim and forced her to perform fellatio, while placing a knife on her back and threatening to kill her if she did not comply. Amarjeet Singh JC (as he then was) sentenced the accused to 12 months’ imprisonment in respect of the s 377 offence.
The Public Prosecutor’s submissions
89        The Public Prosecutor was of the view that the appellant’s sentence of 24 months imprisonment was a “significant departure” from the general sentencing practice in dealing with carnal connection cases involving ordinary sexual intercourse, pursuant to s 140(1)(i) of the Women’s Charter. The Public Prosecutor noted that, if the sentence imposed by the district judge were to be upheld, there would be “some conflict … in the sentencing benchmarks”, in that there would be a fairly large difference between the sentence imposed by the courts for the full act of sexual intercourse in carnal connection cases such as 
Tay Kim Kuan
 (which was 12 months’ imprisonment), and the present sentence imposed for oral sex (which is 24 months’ imprisonment). The Public Prosecutor submitted that some reconciliation might be required.
90        Underlying this submission was the Public Prosecutor’s view that there is ‘little difference in the moral culpability of an accused person who engages in ordinary sexual intercourse rather than unnatural sexual intercourse with a young girl’. The Public Prosecutor was of the view that the same sentencing tariff should apply to both offences.
91        I turn now to consider whether the starting point for sentencing in respect of an offence of fellatio under s 377 of the Penal Code is five years imprisonment.
Whether the “starting point” for sentencing under s 377 of the Penal Code is five years’ imprisonment
92        I was of the view that the district judge had erred in relying on cases such as 
Adam bin Darsin
 and 
Peh Thian Hui
 in concluding that the starting point for sentencing in respect of an offence of fellatio under s 377 against a young victim is “in the region of five years’ imprisonment”. This is because the cases cited by the district judge involved accused persons who shamelessly abused their positions of trust and repeatedly engaged in the sexual exploitation of young victims. These precedents can therefore be distinguished from the present case.
93        In 
Adam bin Darsin
, the accused faced no less than 23 charges for s 377 offences, and only eight charges were proceeded with. He had eight male victims, whose ages ranged between 12 and 15 years old, and the offences were repeatedly committed over a period of one year. The victims respected the accused, regarded him as a family member and called him “uncle”. The accused had taken pains to win the trust of his victims’ families, so that he could have easy access to the victims to satisfy his sexual urges. I should also point out that 15 charges were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. It is trite law that the effect of taking into consideration outstanding offences is to enhance the sentences that would otherwise be awarded: 
PP v Mok Ping Wuen Maurice
 
[1999] 1 SLR 138
. In light of this, a five-year sentence of imprisonment for each of the eight charges was condign.
94        
Peh Thian Hui
 can also be easily distinguished from the present appeal. The accused repeatedly raped and molested his lover’s biological daughter for a period of four years, starting from the time when the victim was nine years old. When the victim was 13 years old, the accused ordered the victim to perform fellatio on him, and this formed the subject matter of the s 377 charge, to which the accused pleaded guilty. The accused also pleaded guilty to a total of nine other charges, with 52 other charges taken into consideration in sentencing. Tay Yong Kwang JC (as he then was) imposed a deterrent sentence as he was of the view that “Peh’s perversion must never be allowed to touch and affect another girl’s life. He must be kept out of society … for a very substantial period of time”. Tay JC therefore imposed a sentence of five years’ imprisonment in respect of the s 377 charge.
95        In my view, the difficulty with attempting to fix a “starting point” for sentencing of fellatio offences under s 377 is that the sheer number of different factual scenarios which could underlie such offences render such an exercise unfruitful and unhelpful. Each case will turn on its own unique facts and the court must always be mindful of this. That said, past cases are indubitably instructive and may serve as critical sentencing guidelines for the court. In respect of the present appeal, I found two cases 
– PP v Pok Raymond
 and 
PP v Netto George Michael
 – particularly helpful.
96        In 
PP v Pok Raymond,
 the accused had posted a message on an Internet chatroom asking for a girl to pose as his temporary girlfriend and engage in petting with him in exchange for money. The victim responded to the accused’s message and met with the accused. On their first meeting, the victim and the accused engaged in fellatio and sexual intercourse. On their second meeting, the victim declined to fellate the accused when he asked her to do so, but he pulled her head towards his penis, causing her to give in and to fellate him reluctantly. This act formed the subject of a charge under s 377 of the Penal Code.
97        The accused was convicted of five other charges in respect of the same victim and two other victims, for offences of anal intercourse, carnal connection with a 14-year-old girl, rape and aggravated rape. In addition to the six charges, the accused agreed that one charge of carnal connection and two charges of rape be taken into consideration in sentencing. The accused had related antecedents for military offences committed during National Service; significantly, these offences included an attempt to peep into a ladies’ toilet and an entry into a female officer’s bunk to search for her undergarments. It was also undisputed that the accused had resorted to blackmailing some of his victims so that he could use them as “virtual sex slaves”. The accused had even caused one of his victims to contract a sexually transmitted disease. Despite these aggravating factors, the accused was only sentenced to 24 months’ imprisonment for the fellatio offence, which is the same sentence as that received by the appellant in the present appeal.
98        I was of the view that there were significant differences between the culpability of the accused in 
Pok Raymond
 and the appellant in the present appeal, warranting that the appellant receive a sentence which was markedly lower than 24 months’ imprisonment.
99        The sentence imposed by the district judge was also problematic when considered alongside the sentence imposed in respect of the s 377 offence in 
Netto Michael George
. There were several aggravating circumstances in that case. In the course of a housebreaking perpetrated by the accused, the victim was forced to perform fellatio. The accused was armed with a knife and had threatened to kill the victim if she did not comply. Notwithstanding this, and the fact that the accused had antecedents, the High Court sentenced him to 12 months’ imprisonment in respect of the s 377 offence. This works out to only half of the sentence imposed on the appellant in the present case.
Disparity between sentences imposed for carnal connection offences and sentences imposed for fellatio offences
100      I also accepted the Public Prosecutor’s point that there was a striking disparity between the appellant’s sentence and sentences imposed by our courts in respect of carnal connection offences under the Women’s Charter.
101      In 
Tay Kim Kuan
, for example, the accused was a 45-year-old man who was convicted under s 140(1)(i) of the Women’s Charter for engaging in sexual intercourse with the victim, who was 15 years old at the time of the offence. As I alluded to earlier, the accused had met the victim in an IRC chatroom, and I had no hesitation in imposing a deterrent sentence in order to protect the young from the perils of the Internet. I sentenced the accused to 12 months’ imprisonment and the maximum fine of $10,000.
102      The circumstances in 
Tay Kim Kuan
 were quite similar to those in the present case and there were only two key differences between the cases:
(a)        the subject matter of the charge in 
Tay Kim Kuan
 was ordinary sexual intercourse, whereas the present case deals with unnatural sexual intercourse; and
(b)        the appellant in the present case was a police officer, whereas the accused in 
Tay Kim Kuan
 was not.
103      As I observed earlier, I was not persuaded that the fact that the appellant was a police officer should be regarded as an aggravating factor in this case.
104      Further, as submitted by the Public Prosecutor, it was simply incongruous for there to be such a large disparity between the sentences imposed in respect of ordinary sexual intercourse cases and those imposed in cases of unnatural sexual intercourse by way of fellatio. I acknowledged that engaging in ordinary sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of 16 years is an offence under the Women’s Charter whereas unnatural sexual intercourse cases fall within the ambit of s 377 of the Penal Code. However, where young victims are concerned, both offences, and the rationale for their criminalisation, are aimed at the protection of young victims from exploitative sexual activity, whether unnatural or not. In this light, I was of the view that there should not be an overly large disparity between sentences under the two provisions.
Conclusion
105      Taking into account all the circumstances of the case, I was drawn to conclude that the appellant’s sentence was manifestly excessive. Thus, I allowed the appellant’s appeal against sentence and reduced the sentence to a term of imprisonment of 12 months.

Choo Han Teck J (delivering the grounds of decision of the court):
1          The appellant killed his wife on 2 December 2005. On 17 July 2006, he pleaded guilty to a charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under s 304(
a
) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) and was sentenced by the High Court to life imprisonment. He appealed against that sentence. He also made an application for further evidence to be adduced and considered for the purpose of the appeal. The reason for this application arose from the mental condition of the appellant and the judge’s grounds of decision (see 
[2006] SGHC 168
) in respect of the sentence imposed. We shall first set out the circumstances of the offence and the mitigation speech made on the appellant’s behalf. The statement of facts (which had included the statement that the appellant was estranged from his siblings) had been read to the appellant and he had accepted it without objection.
2          The appellant is 45 years old and has a twin brother, Ramziz, who has been prominent in the application for further evidence to be adduced. The appellant was a caretaker in a condominium and had been married to his wife for eight years. They have no children. In addition to Ramziz, the appellant has five other siblings. About 1.00am on 2 December 2005, the appellant battered his wife so severely that in spite of medical attention in hospital, the wife succumbed to the injuries she suffered, mainly to her face and head, and died on 4 December 2005.
3          A consultant forensic psychiatrist with the Institute of Mental Health, Dr Stephen Phang, examined the appellant after he had been arrested by the police, and found the appellant to be suffering from a psychiatric disorder known as “Frontal Lobe Syndrome”. A person with this condition is known to be emotionally labile and unable to control his impulses. It was for this reason that Dr Phang formed the opinion that the appellant had lost his impulse control when he killed his wife. At that time, he was also intoxicated with alcohol which most likely aggravated his medical condition, and had lost his temper, leading him eventually to shout at her and batter her. The court below noted that Dr Phang was also of the opinion that the appellant was a potential danger to those around him, and that he required “long-term psychiatric follow-up and care, including the possibility of treatment with medication such as a mood stabiliser”.
4          A second psychiatric opinion was taken from Dr Lim Yun Chin, a consultant psychiatrist at the Raffles Hospital, on the application of defence counsel. Dr Lim is also a consultant psychiatrist with the Singapore Prison Service’s medical board. He was of the opinion that the syndrome developed insidiously, and the appellant was also unaware that alcohol would aggravate his loss of impulse control. He was of the view that although the appellant’s condition was irreversible, it could be controlled with drugs, regular psychiatric assessment, counselling, and psycho-educational programmes. The court below noted the mitigation put forward on the appellant’s behalf, and the undertaking by the appellant that he would abstain from alcohol. The court then referred (at [30] of the grounds of decision) to the three conditions commonly relied upon by the courts in support of a sentence of life imprisonment. The conditions are, first, “[t]he offence or offences are in themselves grave enough to require a very long sentence”; second, if “[i]t appears from the nature of the offences or from the accused’s history that he is a person of unstable character likely to commit such offences in the future”, and third, if “the offences are committed, the consequences to others may be specially injurious, as in the case of sexual offences or crimes of violence”: see also 
Purwanti Parji v PP
 
[2005] 2 SLR 220
. The court noted that the second condition was the most relevant and contentious in the appellant’s case. It was of the view that although the general deterrence of a long sentence was less relevant in a case where the offender was suffering from a mental disorder at the time of the offence, the courts would have to take into account the protection of the public against such an offender. In his grounds of decision, the learned judge below commented on the irreversibility of the appellant’s psychiatric condition and the unlikelihood of having family support upon his release, unlike the case of the accused in 
PP v Chee Cheong Hin
 
[2006] 2 SLR 707
, where the three sisters of the accused deposed that they would help in the rehabilitation and future medical care of the accused.
5          Mr Andy Yeo, counsel for the appellant, submitted before us that it was due to an inadvertence that the court below was led to believe that there would be no family support for the appellant when he was released from prison. He thus sought leave to adduce evidence from the appellant’s twin brother, Ramziz, his eldest brother, Aris, and another brother, Anwar. Counsel submitted that Ramziz was a health-care attendant at the Institute of Mental Health and would have no difficulty looking after the appellant. Counsel submitted that more importantly, Ramziz denied that he had told the investigating officer that the family could not and would not help. Thus, counsel argued that the sentence of life imprisonment was handed down by the judge in the erroneous belief that there would be no familial support after the appellant was released from prison. The two other brothers, Aris and Anwar, deposed affidavits to say that they would help financially and contribute towards paying for the appellant’s medication.
6          Counsel for the prosecution referred to the principles expressed by Lord Denning in 
Ladd v Marshall
 
[1954] 1 WLR 1489
, and submitted that those principles had been adopted by the court in 
Juma’at bin Samad v PP
 
[1993] 3 SLR 338
 (“
Juma’at bin Samad
”). The learned prosecutor argued that none of the three conditions in 
Ladd v Marshall
 had been satisfied. The conditions are, first, the non-availability of the evidence in the proceedings below; second, the evidence would have had an important influence at the trial below; and third, the evidence must be credible, though not necessarily incontrovertible. Mr Yeo argued to the contrary, that the conditions in 
Ladd v Marshall
 had been met, and further, that we should allow the evidence under s 55(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 1999 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”) which provides as follows:
In dealing with any appeal, the Court of Appeal may, if it thinks additional evidence is necessary, either take such evidence itself or direct it to be taken by the trial court.
The court in 
Juma’at bin Samad
 referred to s 257 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) which provides in similar terms as s 55(1) and held at 347, [34] that:
The core principle in s 257 of the CPC, after all, is that additional evidence may be taken if it is necessary, which must mean necessary in the interests of justice. That said, it must be emphasized in no uncertain terms that such a situation will arise only in the most extraordinary circumstances.
Section 257 provides as follows:
In dealing with any appeal under this Chapter the High Court, if it thinks additional evidence is necessary, may either take such evidence itself or direct it to be taken by a District Court or Magistrate’s Court.
The court in 
Juma’at bin Samad
 also referred (at 347, [35]) to the provision in s 257 as a “narrow exception” and to English cases such as 
R v Gatt
 [1963] Crim LR 426, and 
R v Parks
 
[1961] 1 WLR 1484
 that took the view that the power to adduce evidence which was available at trial would be exercised if the court felt that there might otherwise be a miscarriage of justice if leave to adduce such evidence were refused. The rule in s 55(1) of the SCJA and s 257 of the CPC permitting the appellate court to grant leave to adduce further evidence to avoid a miscarriage of justice is to be balanced by the public interest in the finality of trial and ensuring that trials are not reopened each time evidence that should have been admitted at first instance was not admitted. Hence, the courts in cases such as 
Juma’at bin Samad
 and 
R v
 
Parks
 took a narrow view of the provisions in question and regarded them as applicable only in “extraordinary circumstances”. We would, however, emphasise that what is paramount under s 55(1) of the SCJA and s 257 of the CPC is the question of the relevancy, more specifically, materiality, as well as the credibility, of the further evidence to be adduced.
7          The present application did not arise from a trial but from proceedings in which the appellant had indicated that he would not claim trial but plead guilty to the charge against him. There was no evidence other than that which had been admitted by way of the statement of facts. Ultimately, the crucial issue in the proceedings below related only to sentence, which, generally, is a matter of the judge’s discretion. Although 
Ladd v Marshall
 had been used as a reference, we are mindful that it was a civil case. In criminal cases, where the standard of proving guilt is higher, s 55(1) and s 257 of the respective Acts would be the more direct starting points of reference. The three conditions of 
Ladd v Marshall
 may be useful points for consideration even in a criminal case (after all, they are valid and reasonable considerations) so long as the court, in considering them, remains mindful of the higher burden of proving guilt in a criminal case. In a case such as the present, where the only issue is that of sentence, the question of the burden of proof does not have the same significance. That is because, traditionally, counsel has much latitude in what he may say by way of mitigation. In the unusual event in which a particular fact might be crucial and the court thinks that that fact is relevant, it may require it to be proved. It is not apparent or conclusive that the judge below would have required evidence to be taken had the appellant stated in mitigation that his siblings would look after him, even if the Prosecution had challenged that statement.
8          In any event, all the material facts had been disclosed to the Defence in this case. The statement of facts had been given, read and admitted. The Defence knew that the mitigating factor was the lack of impulse control by reason of the appellant’s mental condition. It was aware of the prognosis and the long-term medical treatment that would be required. It was thus incumbent on the Defence to satisfy the court that if a term of life imprisonment was to be avoided, there would be family or other support of a reliable nature that would address the need for the appellant’s long-term medical treatment. The affidavits produced by the appellant’s counsel after sentence had been passed, were, in our unanimous view, inadequate. It was not only that those matters could have been brought out during the mitigation, but the subsequent affidavits did not seem to us to have sufficiently addressed the point that the appellant required close supervision. Aris and Anwar pledged financial support. Ramziz deposed that as a health-care attendant by profession, he could look after the appellant. Aris stated that he was willing to let the appellant stay with his family. The affidavits filed did not convince us that the evidence to be adduced was not previously available or that they were credible. First, the suggestion of unified support from the siblings was contrary to the statement of facts that was admitted by the appellant. Counsel submitted that the Defence was unable to contact the siblings but it seemed strange to us that the appellant and his siblings, who were subsequently said to be close, were not in contact with one another. There was also no evidence that, apart from Ramziz, the other siblings had visited the appellant in remand. All this went towards the question of the credibility of the further evidence to be adduced.
9          In the absence of familial support and in the light of the other factors considered by the court below, like the seriousness of the offence and the manner in which it was committed, the sentence of life imprisonment was not inappropriate. For the reasons above, we disallowed the application for further evidence to be adduced, and also dismissed the appeal proper.",2007-02-23 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

The following written judgments were delivered:—



               Oct. 22
               Barwick C.J.
               
The applicant seeks leave to appeal against his conviction for manslaughter by the Supreme Court of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea 
    [1]
  . According to the facts found by the learned trial judge who sat without a jury to try the case, the applicant and his wife, on the evening of the happenings giving rise to the charge, became involved within their house in a domestic altercation. Apparently the applicant, tired of the verbal exchanges, retired outside the house, presumably to contemplate in the darkness and to avoid further argument. But his wife, seemingly determined that he should not thus escape hearing her views upon whatever had been in difference between them, after an interval, followed him out of doors and there continued, as apparently he viewed the matter, to berate him. It was so dark that the applicant could not see her form or any silhouette of her: but, as she talked, he could form a judgment by the sound of her voice as to where she was. It would seem that he came to feel that he could stand no more of what to him rightly or wrongly was his wife's nagging. He decided that he should beat her, whether to induce in her a more harmonious frame of mind or as an assertion of his marital authority, does not appear; nor in truth does it matter. Suffice it to observe at this point that as the result of an Ordinance of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea, Native Administration Regulations, 1924, as amended, reg. 83, it would appear to be unlawful for a husband physically to chastise a wife. The applicant, whether or not he had been apprised of this statutory limitation upon his marital authority, picked up a stick intending to belay his wife. It was not a heavy stick and the blow which the applicant aimed at her, had it reached her, whilst no doubt it would have hurt her, would not have done her any physical harm. But, as the applicant did not know nor have reason to suspect, his wife had carried outside in her arms their five months old male child. The applicant aimed his blow with the stick at the source of the wife's voice. It landed on the child's head. The blow which would have been no more than moderate chastisement of the mother, caused the death of the child. The applicant was charged with and has been convicted of the manslaughter of the child.

The Criminal Code of the State of Queensland has been adopted as The Criminal Code of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. The relevant provisions of the Code are as follows:
                     
s. 23: 
                        ""Subject to the express provisions of this Code relating to negligent acts and omissions, a person is not criminally responsible for an act or omission which occurs independently of the exercise of his will, or for an event which occurs by accident
                        ""
                     

                     
                     
s. 291: 
                        ""It is unlawful to kill any person unless such killing is authorized or justified or excused by law.""
                     

                     
                     
s. 293: 
                        ""Except as hereinafter set forth, any person who causes the death of another directly or indirectly, by any means whatever, is deemed to have killed that other person.""
                     

                     
                     
s. 303: 
                        ""Any person who unlawfully kills another under such circumstances as not to constitute wilful murder or murder is guilty of manslaughter.""
                     

                     
                  

               

               
The trial judge, upon the facts I have outlined, concluded that by reason of this Court's decision in Mamote-Kulang v. The Queen 
                  
    [1]
  , he was bound to convict the applicant of manslaughter. In the light of that decision, he felt unable to accept the submission made to him that the death of the child was an event which had occurred by accident within the meaning of s. 23 of the Code.



                         (1964) 111 C.L.R. 62; [1963] P. & N.G.L.R. 163.


               
Before this Court, a number of propositions have been put forward by the applicant in support of the general submission that he was not criminally responsible either for the blow struck on the infant's head or for the eventual death of the child. Not all of these propositions had been placed before the trial judge, but none of them require the finding of any fact not found by the judge. Having been favoured with a careful argument of these propositions, I intend to set out my understanding of them.
               
First, it was said that under The Criminal Code, unlike the position at common law, there is no general notion of transferred malice, as, for example, the unlawfulness of an act which unintentionally kills supplying the ""malice"" to found manslaughter. It was pointed out that where the Code desired to resort to such a concept, it did so expressly in relation to specific offences: see ss. 301, 302, 317, 323 (2) which were instanced in this connexion. Counsel referred the Court to R. v. Callaghan
                  
    [1]
  ; Reg. v. Martyr
                  
    [1]
   and Reg. v. Dabelstein
                  
    [2]
  , as indicating the trend of opinion on this question in the Supreme Court of Queensland. Indeed, he claimed that the judgments in those cases amounted in all to a decision in that Court that killing in the course of doing anything in breach of a law was not merely because of that unlawfulness, manslaughter within the Code. The distinction is also recognized in some of the judgments in Mamote-Kulang v. The Queen 
                  
    [3]
  . Consequently, it was submitted that the circumstance that it was unlawful for the applicant to beat, or to attempt to beat, his wife was irrelevant in relation to the present charge.



                         [1942] Q.S.R. 40.

                         [1962] Qd.R. 398.
[1966]  Qd.R. 411.

                         (1964) 111 C.L.R. 62; [1963] P. & N.G.L.R. 163.


               
Next it was said that the act to which s. 23 refers is an act which, of itself or in association with another element, either of specific intent or of consequence, would, if it were the act of the applicant, be visited with punishment under other provisions of the Code. The contrast sought to be drawn was between such an act and the physical movement of the applicant or of his body or parts of it which inaugurated such an act. In the instant case, it was said that the striking of the child would relevantly be an act of the applicant within the meaning of s. 23 and not the wielding of the stick, although that was a voluntary motion and intended to strike someone, that is to say, it was willed as an incipient blow. Counsel was unable to adopt in this connexion what was said in Vallance v. The Queen
                  
    [4]
  , per Dixon C.J. 
    [5]
  , and per Windeyer J. 
    [6]
  . His submission favoured the view that the ""act"" in that case was the striking of the child and not the wounding. He did not go so far as to suggest that the consequence of the striking, i.e., the wounding, was part of the act for the purpose of applying s. 13, cf. Windeyer J. 
    [6]
  —""the whole deed whereby the bullet was caused to strike and wound"". In this submission, the wounding in that case was an event, a conclusion to which Menzies J. came in Vallance v. The Queen
                  
    [7]
  . That case was decided, however, in relation to s. 13 of the Tasmanian Criminal Code which is not in the identical terms of s. 23 of the Code operating in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea and perhaps for this reason at least did not raise precisely the same problem as the instant case, even if, as I think, the expression ""by chance"" in the one is to be taken as equivalent to the expression ""by accident"" in the other.



                         (1961) 108 C.L.R. 56.

The applicant's next proposition was that an event in this case was the death of the infant and that it did occur by accident. Neither the applicant, nor a reasonable man so placed as he was, did or could have foreseen that the blow aimed at the mother would strike and kill the son. It was submitted that in so far as Mamote-Kulang v. The Queen 
                  
    [1]
   denied any part of that proposition, it was not well decided and ought to be overruled.



                         (1964) 111 C.L.R. 62.


               
Lastly, it was submitted that Mamote-Kulang v. The Queen 
                  
    [1]
   was distinguishable upon its facts from the instant case and that the trial judge was in error in considering himself bound to convict because of that decision.



                         (1964) 111 C.L.R. 62.


               
It is quite clear to my mind that the present facts are distinguishable from those in Mamote-Kulang v. The Queen 
                  
    [1]
   and that, notwithstanding the tendency of some of its reasoning, that decision did not require the conviction of the applicant. The essential facts in that case were that the applicant was found by the learned trial judge to have deliberately struck his wife a ""good strong blow"" in the region of the upper abdomen intending to hurt her and to cause her pain. Thus, there was no room in that case to question whether the act of striking the deceased was an exercise of the will of the applicant. Nor, unless the death were regarded as an event within s. 23, could there be any question that any step in the delivery or the landing of the blow or in the circumstances which led to the death was fortuitous. Therefore, putting on one side the question whether the death was in reality and relevantly an event in that case, a clear distinction emerges between the two cases in that in the present case a question does arise as to whether the blow on the child's head can be regarded as having been foreseen or whether anyone could have reasonably expected it as a consequence of the applicant's attempt to strike his wife. Thus, even on the assumption that the wielding of the stick in the attempt to strike his wife was relevantly the act within the first part of s. 23, it could be said that the striking of the child was an event, that is to say, a consequence of the wielding of the stick, which occurred by accident. On the other hand, it could be said that the striking of the child was the relevant act and not the willed act of the applicant. Therefore, on either of these assumptions, neither of which is inconsistent with any reasoning in Mamote-Kulang v. The Queen 
                  
    [1]
   that case does not determine the present. Further, that case can be so distinguished without accepting the view which seems to have been held by some members of the Court in that case that death cannot be an ""event"" within the meaning of s. 23 and that only some circumstance intervening between the act of the applicant and the death can be such an event: see the report p. 66. Therefore, in my opinion, at least because of this distinguishing feature, the case of Mamote-Kulang v. The Queen 
                  
    [1]
   does not determine the present.



                         (1964) 111 C.L.R. 62.

                         (1964) 111 C.L.R. 62.

                         (1964) 111 C.L.R. 62.


               
But it is not enough to my mind that that case does not require the conclusion that the applicant upon the facts before us is not criminally responsible, and particularly not so responsible as for manslaughter. It seems to me that it is necessary to determine what is the precise operation of s. 23 in this case: and that in turn requires, in my opinion, a decision as to what was the act to which the terms of s. 23 should be applied.
               
That section is a general controlling provision but does not necessarily apply to and govern every section. But clearly, in my opinion, it governs ss. 291, 293, 300 and 303. What then was the act of the applicant which ""occurred"" or which did not ""occur"" by an exercise of his will for the purpose of s. 23? The choice on the facts of this case, in my opinion, is between the wielding of the stick and the landing of the blow on the head of the infant child. Clearly enough, if the latter were a willed act of the applicant it cannot be an event, nor can it be a fortuitous event. Further, if the child were struck on the head by an act in the exercise of the will of the applicant, the death of the child could not, in my opinion, be a fortuitous event. The applicant, conceding that he chose to strike the child in that fashion could scarce say either that he might not have foreseen its death as a consequence or that a person placed as he was would not have so foreseen. Thus in this case a problem which arose in Mamote's Case
                  
    [1]
   does not arise.



                         (1964) 111 C.L.R. 62.


               
Whilst perhaps it cannot be categorically asserted that the two branches of s. 23 are in all their applications mutually exclusive so that what falls within the one can never at the same time fall within the other, the total operation of the section in general, in my opinion, is that an act which falls within the first part of the section and is accompanied by the will of the actor may bring a consequence which is accidental. It is such an operation of the comparable though not identical section which Dixon C.J. seems to have contemplated when explaining the meaning of ""an event which occurs by chance"" in s. 13 of the Tasmanian Code: see Vallance v. The Queen
                  
    [1]
  . It is to the consequences of the act or acts of the applicant so falling within the first part to which, in my opinion, the second part of these sections is directed. I am unable to see that death as a consequence of such an act cannot be relevantly an event. In my opinion, an unintended, unforeseeable, fortuitous death which results from an act which is a willed act causally related to that death, may be an event which occurs by accident or by chance.



                         (1961) 108 C.L.R., at p. 61.


               
In including lack of intention in that expression of opinion, I ought to add that I do not regard the exercise of the will to which s. 23 refers to be identical with the presence of intention: nor do I regard the concept of the section to be the equivalent of voluntariness or simply to refer to the presence of volition. Of course, an intended act, in the sense that the actor intended by his action to achieve the full operation of that action as it proved to be in fact, must necessarily, in my opinion, be a willed act within the section. Here for instance, if the applicant had intended to strike the child, though without intent to maim or kill, his act in striking the child must be regarded as a willed act. His lack of intention to maim or kill would, in that connexion, not matter. On the other hand, in my opinion, that the applicant by an act of volition wielded the stick, does not mean that the striking of the child was his willed act. Further, an unintended act, in the sense that the actor did not intend to accomplish what the act in fact did accomplish, may yet be a willed act for the purposes of the section. The truth is, it seems to me, that we lack a sufficiently flexible and at the same time precise vocabulary in this area of discourse: and to make the matter more difficult of consistent expression, the word ""intention"" has more than one relevant use: and volition and voluntariness likewise. However, in connexion with s. 23, in my opinion, the exercise of will involves the making of a choice to do that which the physical activity of the applicant in fact does: e.g., in this case to land the blow on the head of the child.
               
Therefore, it is necessary to my mind in this case to decide whether the striking of the child was an act accompanied by the will of the applicant or whether that striking was no more, relevantly, than a consequence of the wielding of the stick. If it be concluded that the relevant act for the purposes of s. 23 was the striking of the child and that it did not ""occur"" by the exercise of the will of the applicant, then it is the first part of s. 23 which precludes criminal liability on the part of the applicant in this case. On the other hand, if it be concluded that that act was accompanied by an exercise of the applicant's will, there is no room, in my opinion, for the view that the death of the child occurred by accident. That can only be accepted if the wielding of the stick was the relevant act of the applicant.
               
That the applicant's will went with the wielding of the stick is beyond question. That he did not will or choose thereby to strike his infant son is equally beyond question. In my opinion, s. 23 in its first part is directed to an activity which either of itself or in association with some specific intent with which it is done, or with some particular consequence which follows it, attracts criminal responsibility. For it is to guard against such responsibility in the circumstances it describes that s. 23 is enacted as a general controlling provision. It seems to me that what will constitute the relevant act may possibly vary with the nature of the charge. In the instant case the liability to punishment comes from the killing of the child, that is to say from its death by reason of the blow struck upon its head: see ss. 293, 291 and 300 of the Code. That striking, in my opinion, was an act which with its consequential death constitutes in the circumstances the offence of manslaughter. The antecedent wielding of the stick was not, in my opinion, such an act. No punishment was imposed in respect of the wielding of the stick or in respect of that activity coupled with some particular intent or consequence of that wielding. In my opinion, its landing on the child's head and the subsequent death of the child cannot both be regarded as consequences which together with the wielding of the stick will attract punishment, or, put another way, the landing of the blow on the child's head cannot properly be regarded for the purpose of applying the section in this case as a consequence of the wielding of the stick. It is part of a single act of striking the child, not divisible into an inaugurating motion and a concluding phase.
               
With every respect to those who may think otherwise, I have come to the conclusion that the relevant act in this case was the striking of the child on the head; that it was not an exercise of the will of the applicant, was not his willed act: and from the point of view of criminal responsibility not his act at all. I prefer to express my conclusion in this way rather than to say that the applicant did not intend to strike the child, though that truly can be said. I would prefer as far as possible to keep the use of the word intention to express the intention to achieve the consequences of a willed act, that is to say, to achieve some result, or consequence or to fulfil some purpose.
               
Being of this opinion, I would grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal and quash the conviction of the applicant for manslaughter.
            


               
McTiernan J.
               
I am of opinion leave to appeal should be given to the prisoner. The question in the appeal arises under s. 23 of The Criminal Code (Queensland, adopted). The primary submission for the prisoner is that in virtue of the first rule in s. 23 he is not criminally responsible for the killing of his son. The conviction against which the prisoner appeals was for manslaughter. This offence is defined by s. 303. Killing is defined as causing death by any means whatever. Section 293 is the definition section relating to killing. It seems clear from the plan of the Code that s. 23 governs the criminal responsibility of a person charged with the crime of manslaughter (see s. 36 of the Code). In the first place it is necessary to decide what is the proper construction of the words ""act"" and ""omission"" in the expression ""act or omission which occurs independently of the exercise of his will"". I am of opinion the word ""act"" or ""omission"" means the external elements of the crime—what was done or omitted to be done rendering the person charged in a given case liable to punishment under the Code unless he is relieved by the rule that the ""act"" or ""omission"" was not intentional or willed by him. I adopt the words ""external elements"" from the judgment of Dixon C.J. in Vallance v. The Queen
                  
    [1]
  . This expression ""external elements"" or words of similar import are to be found in the textbook Criminal Law by Glanville Williams (see 2nd ed.,  Ch. 1, ss. 1-11) and the textbook Australian Criminal Law by Colin Howard  at p. 12 and in the discussion  at p. 342 et seq. It seems to me that in the light afforded by the context in which the words ""act"" and ""omission"" are found the former (the relevant word here) extends to the physical movement involved in the commission of a crime and the consequences of such action. This construction of the word ""act"" widens the rule in s. 23 under discussion beyond the limits of the principle of voluntariness, but of course the rule includes it. It is not without importance that the heading of s. 23 includes the word ""intention"". In my judgment therefore in the present case the ""act"" for the purposes of s. 23 was the bodily movement involved in striking with the stick and the impact of the blow on the child, the cause of death. The fact therefore that the accused did not lack physical capacity to control the physical action of striking at his wife with the stick did not take the accused out of the first rule in s. 23. The findings of fact made by the learned judge are not disputed. They are set forth in his reasons for judgment. He had no occasion to consider the question of the application of the first rule in s. 23, because the defence rested solely on the second rule. The findings raise a strong inference that the impact of the blow on the child was not intentional or willed, also that the cause of the death of the child was not a reckless disregard of any danger to the child involved in striking at the mother with the stick. In my judgment the first rule in s. 23 was applicable. In the view I take it is unnecessary to consider whether the second rule in s. 23 creating a defence of accident ought to have been held by the learned judge to discharge the prisoner of criminal responsibility. Therefore, I would allow the appeal.

Kitto J.
               
I agree in the judgment of Owen J., which I have had an opportunity of reading, and have nothing to add.
            


               
Menzies J.
               
In my opinion the death of the appellant's child from being struck upon the head with a stick when the appellant aimed a blow at his wife in the dark and without knowledge or occasion for foreseeing that she was then carrying the child, was an event which occurred by accident. Furthermore I do not think that the decision of the Court in Mamote-Kulang v. The Queen 
                  
    [1]
  —where the deceased was killed as the direct result of a blow aimed at her by the accused—precludes me from coming to this conclusion. I do not regard the decision in the earlier case as denying that death, as the result of a blow, can be regarded as an ""event"" for the purpose of s. 23.



                         (1964) 111 C.L.R. 62.


               
Accordingly I would allow the appeal and quash the conviction upon the ground that, upon the findings made, s. 23 of The Criminal Code excuses the appellant from criminal responsibility for causing his child's death.
            


               
Windeyer J.
               
This case arises out of a sad event. It seemed to me a simple case, because the accused father's killing of his child was, I consider, an unfortunate accident for which he, the father, was not criminally responsible. But to say only that would be to differ too summarily from the conclusions of the learned trial judge; and it would avoid some serious and fundamental questions which were pressed upon us in argument. I think therefore that I must explain the reasons for my conclusion and deal with propositions which were advanced. This involves some going over of topics on which I have in other cases stated my views. So far as I adhere to my already expressed opinions, and so far as I consider that, having regard to the decisions of this Court, I am at liberty to do so, I shall simply refer to what I have said elsewhere to avoid some repetition of reasoning.
               
The basic and primary facts of the case are not in dispute. We should accept them as the learned trial judge has stated them. We should accept too his Honour's finding that ""a case of criminal negligence based on a breach of s. 289 had not been made out""
                  
    [1]
  .


[1967-68] P. & N.G.L.R. 310,  at p. 319.
                     


               
I may say at this point that I do not see how s. 289 of The Criminal Code could have been invoked in this case. As I read it, it applies only when there has been a lack of care in the use or management of a thing of such a kind that, unless carefully managed and used, the life, safety or health of any person may be endangered by it. This seems to me to refer to negligence in the use of things which are in their nature dangerous in ordinary use. I would not myself have read the section as referring to the use in a dangerous way of a thing of any sort or kind. I confess that I doubt the essential validity of the distinction between things dangerous in themselves and things dangerous sub modo. Scepticism about this is growing: see Salmond on Torts, 14th ed. (1965) pp. 426-431. Any chattel used negligently, or for some purpose foreign to its ordinary use, can be a dangerous instrument. Nevertheless the description of some chattels as dangerous in themselves has long been known to the common law. It has too been adopted by the legislatures in such terms as ""dangerous machinery"". I say no more as to s. 289, because the point was alluded to, but not developed, in the argument. I prefer therefore not to express a concluded opinion on it, especially as it has recently given rise to differing opinions among the judges of the Supreme Court of Queensland. If the stick with which the accused struck at his wife and actually hit his child could be said to be a thing of a kind to which s. 289 applies, and assuming further that the accused failed to take proper precautions to avoid the dangers of its use, then he could not rely upon s. 23 of the Code to exculpate him from criminal responsibility: Callaghan v. The Queen
                  
    [1]
  , and see per Taylor J. in Evgeniou v. The Queen
                  
    [2]
  . But as I consider that s. 289 had no bearing on this case, I leave it and turn to the main questions.

                         (1964) 37 A.L.J.R. 508, at p. 511.


               
The accused caused the death of his child. That means that, within the meaning of the Code, he killed his child (s. 293). Then s. 291 comes into play. It provides thatIt is unlawful to kill any person unless such killing is authorised or justified or excused by law.
               

               
The killing was unintentional; and it was for the accused an altogether unexpected consequence of his conduct. Clearly the case was not one of either wilful murder or murder as defined by s. 301 and s. 302. The prosecution said it was manslaughter, which is described in s. 303 as follows:A person who unlawfully kills another under such circumstances as not to constitute wilful murder or murder is guilty of manslaughter.In answer to this the accused said that the killing was, within the meaning of s. 291, ""excused by law"". For this s. 23 was principally relied on. But before going to it I think I should set out my understanding of the phrase ""excused by law"", which has an ancient derivation and a present sense.
               
I discussed this in what I wrote in Mamote-Kulang's Case
                  
    [1]
  . I merely repeat part of what I then said:I read the words of s. 291 ""unless such killing is authorised or justified or excused by law"" as meaning authorized, justified or excused by the common law, or by the Code itself, or by some other enactment.I am aware that this is not accepted by some people. They think that an excuse can never be looked for in the common law, because it is said that the common law has been displaced by the Code, and that matters of excuse must be found in the Code or some later statute. This may be true in Queensland by virtue of The Criminal Code Act, 1899. Section 2 and 5 of that Act are taken to make the Code there the exclusive source of the law in all indictable offences, with only the exceptions which the Act specifies. The whole of the law on any topic dealt with by the Code must thus it is said be found in the Code. There is not in Queensland any provision like that of the Tasmanian Criminal Code Act 1924, s. 8, which expressly preserves
                      all rules and principles of the common law which render any circumstances a justification or excuse for any act or omission, or a defence to a charge upon indictment,  except in so far as they are altered by, or are inconsistent with, the Code.In New Guinea the Queensland Criminal Code is in force having been adopted by the Laws Repeal and Adopting Ordinance, 1921-1939, s. 13. But, so far as I am aware, no provisions similar to The Criminal Code Act 
                  Q. have been enacted for the Territory. Nor, on the other hand, are there, so far as I know, any provisions similar to those of Tasmania expressly preserving common law defences. It seems to me, however, that the absence of an express retention of the common law does not mean that it has been entirely displaced by the Code except where the Code covers the whole of the ground. The rules and principles of the common law, as modified by statute in England before 9th May, 1921, are in force in the Territory so far as not abrogated by later legislation in force there: Booth v. Booth
                  
    [1]
  . Therefore, as I understand the position, any rule or principle of the common law which can stand with and give an actual content to any provision of the Code is to be regarded in construing and applying the Code. I therefore read s. 291 of the Code as having the effect that a homicide which is excused by any rule or principle of the common law is not unlawful in the Territory. I do not find anything in the Code which narrows the excuses for homicide which the common law allows, or which would make punishable any homicide which the common law would treat as guiltless. By the common law a homicide has, for centuries, been excused if it occurred by misadventure, per infortunium, or as some of the early writers, including Hale, put it, was ""simply casual"". In modern terminology this may be rendered as ""by accident"" or ""accidental"". But the common law excused only such homicides as were the accidental consequences of lawful and careful acts. Thus it was that Hale said that if a man ""strike at one, and missing him kills another, whom he did not intend, this is felony and homicide, and not casualty or per infortunium"": Hale, Pleas of the Crown I,  at p. 39
                  . If that statement, unqualified and unexplained, expressed the rule of the common law today, then the accused in the present case could find no exculpation in the common law. But the early common law doctrines of felony-murder and transferred malice have been much modified by judicial development in the course of years. I tried to explain these developments and the state of the law today in what I wrote in Mamote-Kulang's Case
                  
    [1]
  , and in Ryan v. The Queen
                  
    [2]
  . So far as relevant to the present matter, I think it correct to say that by the common law today an unintended, wholly unexpected and unlikely killing is manslaughter if, but only if, it be the result of some act which is both unlawful and in the circumstances dangerous, or is the result of some conduct amounting to reckless negligence. The only thing which would stand in the way of the killing of the child in the present case being excusable by the common law is that in striking at his wife the accused was attempting to commit an unlawful act—unlawful by virtue of Native Administration Regulations, 1924 (as amended), reg. 83. Whether in this case provocation by the wife could have exonerated the accused had his attempt at chastisement been effective need not be considered. He made an attempt to do an unlawful act. But there is nothing to shew that it was an act of such a character as, within the present-day doctrine of the common law, would render inexcusable the unintended and unexpected killing of the child. Nor is there any finding that the killing was the result of criminal negligence; and the facts as found would not, it seems, have supported such a finding. I think, therefore, that the killing of the child was, within the meaning of s. 291 of the Code, excused by law, meaning by the common law.

I realize that in thus finding an excuse in common law doctrine I may seem to take a short-cut and to by-pass some troublesome questions of the Code. I turn therefore to the route, through the Code alone, which counsel for the appellant invited us to follow. The argument revolved round s. 23 of the Code. I therefore set it out in full.
               

                  
23. Subject to the express provisions of this Code relating to negligent acts and omissions, a person is not criminally responsible for an act or omission which occurs independently of the exercise of his will, or for an event which occurs by accident.Unless the intention to cause a particular result is expressly declared to be an element of the offence constituted, in whole or part, by an act or omission, the result intended to be caused by an act or omission is immaterial.
                     
Unless otherwise expressly declared, the motive by which a person is induced to do or omit to do an act, or to form an intention, is immaterial so far as regards criminal responsibility.
                  

               

               
The phrase ""criminally responsible"" is defined, in s. 1 of the Code, as meaning ""liable to punishment as for an offence"". By s. 2, ""an act or omission which renders the person doing the act or making the omission liable to punishment is called an offence"".
               
Sir Samuel Griffith, the draftsman of The Criminal Code, said, and his remark has been often repeated, that as a result of s. 23 it is now never necessary in Queensland to have recourse to the old doctrine of mens rea. Cooper C.J. and Lukin J. in the Supreme Court of Queensland said, in 1920, that
                      the Queensland legislature have, by the express provisions of ss. 23, 24, and 25, laid down in clear terms what the law in future should be in regard to the very much debated, very much misunderstood, and very confused doctrine of what is referred to as mens rea: Thomas v. McEather
    [1]
  .That was too sanguine an utterance. The ""clear terms"" have in recent times caused difficulties and dissents in courts; and learned discussions of them have led to some variety of opinion. Section 23 no doubt reflects common law doctrine; and it also supersedes it. It does so using the language of analytical jurisprudence. It has been suggested that, strictly construed, this is too compressed to be compendious.



                            [1920] Q.S.R. 166, at p. 175.


               
Since its enactment in 1899 the Queensland Code has been copied and adopted elsewhere. The provisions of s. 23 now appear, in exactly the same terms, in the Criminal Codes of Western Australia, Kenya and Nigeria, and I believe of other African States; and s. 13 of the Tasmanian Criminal Code is generally considered to have the same effect notwithstanding verbal alterations. All this would no doubt have been as pleasing to Sir Samuel Griffith as it would I imagine have been surprising to him to know of the difficulties and debates which the seemingly simple words of s. 23 have produced.
               
Counsel's statement to us that s. 23 had no forerunner, and that it was entirely of Sir Samuel Griffith's devising, is I think only half correct. He had gathered the words for s. 23, and the ideas he sought to express in it, from well-known writings, including I assume the Report of the Criminal Law Commissioners of 1833. But he used the old words and known phrases to formulate a rule, not, as they had been previously used, for the exposition of a principle. The result has been to emphasize the distinction between interpreting a statute and reading a judicial explanation of common law doctrine. To say this is not to underrate the magnitude of the task of producing the Code or the merit of its accomplishment. It is merely to say that in interpreting and applying its general and governing provisions, of which s. 23 is one, attention has naturally become directed to the meanings of words as both the source and the definition of a rule. Judicial decisions as to their application in particular cases are never more than exegetical. They cannot add to, alter, or diminish the meaning or effect of the terms in which the rule is formulated. It is by the words, used in relation to their subject matter, criminal responsibility, that courts must be governed in every case. I go then to the words and phrases of s. 23. I do so with diffidence. Judges may have to decide, although doctors disagree. Yet anyone who carefully examines recent writings on the place of mental elements in crime becomes aware of disagreements between doctors, Doctors Glanville Williams, Turner and Hart, among others. And those who have written expressly about s. 23, among them Messrs. Okonkwo and Naish in their book on Criminal Law in Nigeria; Dr. Howard in his Australian Criminal Law and Mr. Morris in the University of Queensland Law Journal, have demonstrated the linguistic problems that lurk in it. I do not propose to engage in lengthy citation of this academical literature. I simply acknowledge its suggestiveness while admitting to doubts and misgivings which it has created for me. Some of the questions which have arisen, or been raised, depend upon philosophical and psychological concepts which lie behind the words ""act"", ""will"", ""event"", ""accident"". Learned, but inconclusive, academic arguments about these words in relation to the idea of foresight of consequences resemble the debate, about matters different from law, described in Paradise Lost (Book II, 1. 558):Others apart sat on a hill retired,In thoughts more elevate, and reasoned high
                     
Of providence, foreknowledge, will and fate—
                     
Fixed fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute,
                     
And found no end, in wandering mazes lost.
                  
But we must try to escape from wandering mazes and find an end, or at least reach a position beyond which we need not travel for the resolution of this and similar cases. One of the difficulties comes from the need to relate will to acts, and to define precisely the distinction, commonly accepted by lawyers, between intention and volition. These words are used glibly; and often with little definition of the sense in which they are used. In Iannella v. French
                  
    [1]
  , I referred to what Professor Hart had said of the imprecise and varied senses in which the words ""voluntary"" and ""involuntary"" are used by lawyers. I need not repeat that. I am aware that Professor Hart's main thesis in the article in the proceedings of the Aristotelian Society from which I quoted has been trenchantly criticised by other learned persons: see Philosophical Review (1960), pp. 221 and 226; and that he has himself accepted the criticisms as in part justified. But the passage I quoted needs, I think, no emendation or subtraction. With it in mind, I have in this judgment eschewed the word ""voluntary"" as an adjective qualifying ""act"". Instead I use the phrase ""willed act"", a term which judgments of the Supreme Court of Queensland and writers on jurisprudence have made familiar. I have also avoided the words ""wilful"" and ""wilfully"". Etymologically I think that their meanings accord with ""willed"" and with ""voluntary"" in the sense of willed, and when dealing, in Vallance's Case
                  
    [1]
   with the description in the Tasmanian Criminal Code of an act as ""voluntary and intentional"", I translated this as a deed ""done wilfully and intentionally"". But it seems desirable, in considering the general terms of s. 23 of the Queensland Code, to avoid certain words or phrases which are used in relation to specific offences in the Code—such as ""intentional omission"" (s. 477), ""advisedly"" (s. 56), ""wilfully and unlawfully"" (s. 469), ""wilfully"" (s. 108). Therefore I shall use the term ""willed act"" to mean an act of an accused which is not one ""which occurs independently of the exercise of his will"" within the meaning of s. 23.

This case seems to have turned at the trial on the meaning of the phrase ""an event which occurs by accident"". However, in the argument for the appellant before us, counsel urged primarily that the killing of the child was not a willed act. Alternatively and secondarily he said it had occurred by accident. I shall deal with these two propositions in the order in which they were put forward.
               
In general, criminal responsibility is today attached to moral blame. And according to deeply rooted beliefs blameworthiness does not depend simply on what a man did, or on the results his actions caused. It depends upon his knowledge and his intentions when he acted—or upon his advertence to the possible consequences of what he was doing or was about to do, or his careless ignoring of them. That of course is trite. The doctrines of mens rea in the common law and of dole in the law of Scotland express this element in guilt. I see no reason for thinking that s. 23 demands any departure from this basic concept or that it at all attenuates it. The words used reflect a view of psychological processes which at the end of last century had become accepted, dominant and orthodox for legal purposes. They must be read literally.
               
The first question was said to be, what is the scope of the word ""act"" in the phrase ""an act which occurs independently of the exercise of the will""? Broadly speaking, two views of this have been put forward. They may be summarily described as follows. On the one hand, ""act"" here means some bodily movement. This is sometimes more exactly called a muscular contraction. On the other hand, the word ""act"" is said to comprehend all that has sometimes been called the overt acts of the accused, sometimes described as ""the external elements of the offence charged"" as distinct from whatever inward, that is mental, attributes must be added to make the actor guilty. In this sense act in s. 23 is close to what has been unhappily called the actus reus of an offence.
               
I venture to repeat here a passage from what I wrote in Mamote-Kulang's Case
                  
    [1]
  . I said:The phrase ""independently of the exercise of the will"" refers, I think, to volition rather than to intention. The word ""will"" seems to be used in the way in which it had come to be used by writers on criminal law at the time the Code was framed, that is with the meaning that it had for Austin rather than for Blackstone. The language of s. 23 at this point may be contrasted with the different language of s. 13 of the Tasmanian Criminal Code which refers to an act that is ""voluntary and intentional"". But, when read as a whole, the first sentence of s. 23 seems to me to express the idea of a willed act done to produce, and in fact producing, an immediate intended consequence.
               




                         (1964) 111 C.L.R., at p. 81.


               
What I thus said does add, and it was meant to add, some element of intention, end and purpose to the notion of a willed act as merely a bodily reaction to a mental stimulus. In short I do not read the word ""act"" in s. 23 as limited by its strict Austinian sense (see Austin, Lectures on Jurisprudence, Lecture XVIII); and I do not think that the judgments of the other members of the Court in Vallance's Case
                  
    [1]
   require me to do so. That case turned upon the words of the Tasmanian Code. It seems to me that in its context in s. 23 the word ""act"" must refer to some act which, if it were a willed act, would render the doer of it liable to punishment for an offence. A man is not punishable for a bodily movement, but for a bodily movement which produces some prescribed consequences. For instance, pressing the trigger of a firearm is not of itself a punishable act. But if the firearm was loaded, and known to be loaded, pressing the trigger is not merely a dorsiflexion of the finger, it is, unless the weapon misfires, a discharging of it. If the weapon was levelled at some person at such a range that to discharge it must cause a wounding or killing, it is the wounding or killing which, as I see it, is the punishable act.



                         (1961) 108 C.L.R. 56.


               
When considering a man's responsibility for his willed acts it thus seems to me impossible to separate a willed physical movement, a muscular contraction, from any immediate, necessary and inevitable consequences. Together they make up the act, to the doing of which criminal responsibility attaches. Suppose a man hits a glass window with a heavy hammer, thereby shattering the glass. Would the breaking of the glass not be his act for the purpose of s. 23? Again, suppose a person orally demands money by threats of injury. Can the action of his vocal cords be separated from the resulting sound issuing from his mouth and its intended meaning to the hearer? The use of threatening words would, I consider, be properly called his act. Again, if a man stabs another with a knife, why is not the wounding of the victim his willed act? True, it can be said to be but the result of the act of plunging a knife into the victim's body. But it is an inescapable result and the wounding of the victim is therefore to my mind the act of the assailant.
               
It will I trust be apparent from what I have said that I am not able to accept as valid, for all purposes and in all circumstances, a distinction between volition and intention as separate states of the mind, except in cases when an intent to produce a particular result is expressly made an element of a punishable act. Any act must no doubt precede its consequences; but to ask was the act willed, and then was its result intended, seems to me in many cases to put a single mental process into separate compartments. I appreciate the idea of willed means to a desired end: and I hope I understand the sense in which the word conation has been used and the distinction between it and cognition. I do not for a moment dispute that the distinction between will and intention has been long accepted and is very satisfying and useful for many purposes of law. I am not qualified to pass an opinion on its philosophical and psychological validity. I therefore say no more than that in Professor Hart's recently published collection of his essays under the title Punishment and Responsibility—in particular perhaps Ch. IV, called Acts of Will and Responsibility and Ch. VI, called Negligence, Mens Rea, and Criminal Responsibility—there is much which must at least cause one to pause and ponder.
               
As I understand s. 23 the act of the accused in this case was hitting the child on the head with a stick thereby killing him. Was this an act done independently of the will or was it willed? The wielding of the stick was a physical act done in response to a mental stimulus. It was in every sense willed. But it was willed as a blow aimed at the woman, not at the child. Had it struck her, the assaulting of her causing her pain would have been in my opinion a willed act. It did not strike her. It is the striking of the child causing death which is said to result in criminal responsibility. Was that a willed act? I think that it was not. In saying this I do not wish to be taken as endorsing all that was put to us by counsel for the appellant. Some of the hypothetical illustrations put in argument seemed to me to be extravagant and wide of the mark. I certainly do not mean to confound the doing of an act with the intent or purpose with which it was done. But I do not think that striking the child, who unknown to the accused stood in the way of the blow aimed at the mother, was a willed act, or part of a willed act of the accused. To exculpate the appellant in this way does, I realize, give the phrase ""independently of the exercise of the will"" a wider application than on occasions it has been given in the past. I therefore express my opinion on the first proposition put for the appellant with some hesitation.
               
I go now to the second and alternative proposition. Here I have no hesitation at all. To my mind the striking of the child thereby causing death was an event which occurred by accident within the meaning of s. 23. There is no need to go to dictionaries in the search of a meaning for either ""event"" or ""accident"".
               
An event in s. 23 clearly means a happening for which an accused person could be criminally responsible if it did not occur by accident and he was not otherwise exonerated. Therefore an event in this context refers to the outcome of some action or conduct of the accused, for a man cannot be responsible for an event in which he had no part at all; and it would be unnecessary to say so.
               
As to accident, for centuries courts and the great writers on the criminal law have spoken of misadventure or accident as, by the common law, excusing a homicide. There is no reason I think to seek for any new meaning for an old word now appearing in the Code and expressing an old idea. The only change which the Code has made is that whereas by the common law misadventure excused only a homicide which was not associated with an unlawful act, the Code provides that an accidental event is never of itself punishable, and it is immaterial whether it arose out of the doing of an unlawful act or of a lawful act. The only question then is, was the killing of the child ""an event which occurred by accident""? Accident is I think a matter of defence, in the sense that it is not necessary for the prosecution to negative at the outset the possibility of accident. But, as the ultimate burden is on the Crown of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the offence charged was committed, the accused must be acquitted of that offence if, on the whole of the evidence, it be doubtful whether any event which is an element of that offence occurred by accident. Professor Cross and Mr. Jones in their Introduction to Criminal Law, 5th ed., pp. 87, 88, say that ""The defence of accident is based on the fact that the accused did not foresee that his conduct would have the consequences prohibited by the definition of the crime charged"". In relation to homicide this must be read bearing in mind that in manslaughter the killing was never intended or foreseen. If it were, it is murder, not manslaughter. But, with this in mind, the remarks by the learned authors on the various meanings of accident—or perhaps it would be better to say the various ways in which an accident may occur as a ground of exculpation at common law—are a helpful summary. I quote several sentences.It [accident] may be contrasted with the defence of mistake of fact because that defence goes to the accused's state of mind concerning the circumstances surrounding his conduct, rather than its consequences. We have seen, however, that an accident may be caused by a mistake. Foster cites a case in which a man left his gun unloaded and went to church. The weapon was loaded while he was away, and he subsequently killed his wife by firing at her, when believing, on reasonable grounds, that it was unloaded. The death was the result of an accident and, there being no criminal negligence, the accused was acquitted of any unlawful homicide: Crown Law 265.and later:There are also cases of what may be called ""pure"" accident in which someone who was conscious of his controlled bodily movements, and aware of all relevant facts, did not foresee that his conduct would have the prohibited consequences owing to the operation of influences having nothing to do with his state of mind. Someone aims a bullet at a crow, but, owing to the presence of a high wind or the fact that he is a poor shot, he hits a house pigeon. In either event, he is said to have killed the bird accidentally.Sometimes, when the accused alleges that an event was an accident, he simply means that he had no causal connection with it. The matter is further complicated by the fact that an event is often said not to have been an accident if it was the outcome of negligence, and occasionally the broader practice of describing all unintended consequences as accidental is followed.
                  

               

               
In the light of the decision in Vallance's Case
                  
    [1]
   it can now be said that an event occurs by accident if it was not intended, not foreseen, and unlikely, that is not reasonably to be foreseen as a consequence of a man's conduct.



                         (1961) 108 C.L.R. 56.


               
In the present case the striking of the child causing his death seems to me to answer the description of an event which occurred by accident. At the trial a view to the contrary was urged upon the learned judge, which he felt constrained to adopt. It was founded upon some observations in the case of Mamote-Kulang 
                  
    [1]
  . But the facts of that case were quite unlike the facts of this case. Statements in that case which proved misleading in this case were made in reference to those facts. There the accused had killed his wife by hitting her intending to hurt her. She died from the blow because she had an enlarged spleen the result of malaria. Now, so far as I know, it has always been the law—and the Code has made no alteration in this—that if a man strikes another without his consent intending to harm or hurt him, although not to kill him, if death ensues as a result of the blow, the homicide is criminal. If the intention was to cause grievous bodily harm, it is murder; if some lesser harm or hurt was intended, it is manslaughter. It matters not that the man who delivered the blow did not intend to kill. It matters not that death occurred because, unknown to him, the person he struck was frail and easily killed. If his blow actually caused the death of the person whom he intentionally hit, it is manslaughter at the least. This, for the time being at least, is the result of a long chapter in the history of our law. One consequence is that the moral blame in homicides less than murder varies greatly with circumstances. Sentences for manslaughter can thus justly vary from very light to very severe. A Scottish judge once said the crime of culpable homicide (which we call manslaughter) varies from a merely nominal crime to the very confines of murder: see Her Majesty's Advocate v. A.B.

The accused in Mamote-Kulang's Case
                  
    [1]
   had no intention of killing his wife and it was found by the trial judge thathe did not actually foresee her death as a possible consequence of his attack. He acted in anger without thinking about it.Many natives in the Territory, and I suppose most Europeans there, do know of the danger of striking a person whose spleen has been enlarged by malaria: see the findings quoted 
    [2]
  . It may well be, therefore, that it was not right in that case to regard death as being not objectively foreseeable or probable. However, that was assumed to have been so. The defence was that the death was an event which occurred by accident. That led in this Court to some examination of the question of causation involved. Was there some factor other than the act of the accused which was in a relevant sense the cause of death, so that the killing was, so far as the accused was concerned, an event which occurred by accident. It was an old question, familiar in law, however questionable in philosophy, of asking was there what has been called a break in the chain of causation by what lawyers have described as a novus actus interveniens. Sir Frederick Pollock warned that
                      the lawyer cannot afford to adventure himself with philosophers in the logical and metaphysical controversies that beset the idea of cause.I said all that I can usefully say on this topic in National Insurance Co. of New Zealand Ltd. v. Espagne
                  
    [1]
  . However, it may be permissible to say again that, in ascribing effects to causes, and in seeking the cause of an event, the purpose of law, civil and criminal, is to attribute legal responsibility to some person—""to fix liability on some responsible person"", Lord Sumner said in Weld-Blundell v. Stephens
                  
    [1]
  . What seems to me to have been the mistake at the trial of the present case was to take references in Mamote-Kulang's Case
                  
    [2]
   to the absence of any new factor between the blow and its consequence, the death, as meaning that unless there were such a factor present a homicide could never be said to have occurred by accident. In the present case the question whether there was an event which occurred by accident arose in an altogether different way, and matters alluded to in the former case could not, as I see it, have any bearing on this case. In this case the question is not whether death after a blow intentionally delivered was an event which occurred by accident. It is whether the striking of the child whereby he was killed was an event which occurred by accident. In my opinion it was, because it was not intended and it occurred as the result of the accused being both ignorant of a circumstance (the presence of the child) in which he wielded the stick, and without any foresight of the consequence of his doing so. These facts remove it from the area of mens rea and bring it within the description of an accidental event.

Before leaving this part of the case it may be of interest to notice that cases similar to Mamote-Kulang's Case
                  
    [2]
   have occurred in African jurisdictions where provisions similar to those of the Code prevail. In two reported cases the killing, by blows delivered in the course of quarrels, of persons whose spleens were enlarged by malaria has been taken to be manslaughter although death was neither intended nor expected: Friday Ntah v. The Queen
                  
    [3]
  ; Saidi s/o Abdalla v. The King

I should I think add that, notwithstanding some superficial similarity, the facts of this case differ materially from those in R. v. Tsagaroan-Kagobo
                  
    [5]
  , a decision of Mann C.J. That was a case of reckless negligence, and I see no ground for questioning the correctness of that decision.


[1965-66] P. & N.G.L.R. 122.


               
Some argument was addressed to us on the basis of mistake, invoking s. 24. In the view I take it is not necessary that I say anything about that.
               
In my opinion leave to appeal should be given. The case was fully argued and, as counsel for the Crown agreed that if we were in favour of allowing the appeal the conviction should be quashed, I consider that this should be the form of the order. As it seems that no other charge is to be laid against him, the prisoner should I consider be released.
            


               
Owen J.
               
The applicant was indicted before the Supreme Court of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea upon a charge of having unlawfully killed one Kandamain Timbu on 8th January 1968 and was convicted. The trial took place before Clarkson J. 
    [1]
  , sitting without a jury and, as his Honour said, the facts were not disputed. The deceased was the son of the applicant and his wife and was five or six months old. During the night of 8th January a quarrel had developed between the applicant and his wife and the applicant left their house and sat down a short distance away. His wife followed him carrying the child and abusing him. He decided to chastise her and for that purpose picked up a light stick. It was dark and he could not see and did not know that his wife was then carrying the child nor could he or anyone in his situation have reasonably foreseen that the child would be with her at that hour. He aimed a blow at his wife with the stick but it struck the child on the head, fracturing its skull, and death resulted. The same blow delivered to an adult would be unlikely to have caused significant injury.


[1967-68] P. & N.G.L.R. 310.


               
One of the submissions made to the learned trial judge and before this Court was that the applicant was not criminally responsible for the child's death because of the provisions of s. 23 of the Criminal Code which is in force in the Territory. That section provides that:Subject to the express provisions of this Code relating to negligent acts and omissions, a person is not criminally responsible for an act or omission which occurs independently of the exercise of his will, or for an event which occurs by accident.Two arguments were put forward to us by counsel for the applicant. First it was said that the striking of the child was an act which occurred independently of the exercise of the applicant's will. Next it was said that the striking of the child and its death were events which had occurred by accident. I find it unnecessary to consider the first of these submissions since the second of them should, in my opinion, be upheld. Had the case been one in which the child had unexpectedly and unforeseeably been carried by someone other than its mother between the applicant and his wife at the critical moment with the result that the blow aimed at the wife had struck and killed the child, or had the case been one in which someone had unexpectedly and unforeseeably run between them and, receiving the blow aimed at the wife, had died as a result, the second limb of s. 23 would, in my opinion, have afforded an answer to a charge of unlawfully killing. In either such case, whether the ""event"" of which the section speaks should be regarded as the death or as the actual impact of the blow which resulted in death it would, in my opinion, have been one which occurred by accident and I can see no distinction between cases of that kind and the present case. The learned trial judge felt, however, that various passages to which he referred in the judgments of members of this Court in Mamote-Kulang v. The Queen 
                  
    [1]
   pointed to the conclusion that in the present case there had not been any ""event"" which had occurred by accident. But, as his Honour recognized, the facts in Mamote-Kulang's Case
                  
    [1]
   were very different. There the accused intentionally aimed a blow at and struck his wife, the blow ruptured her spleen, which was greatly enlarged, and caused her death. The Court held that neither the blow nor the fact that the wife had an enlarged spleen nor the death was an event occurring by accident.

                         (1964) 111 C.L.R. 62.


               
In the present case the aiming of a blow at the wife was intentional but before it reached its target, a wholly unexpected and an unforeseeable event intervened. The child's head intercepted the blow aimed by the applicant at his wife. In these circumstances the fact that the blow struck the child was, it seems to me, an ""event"" which occurred by accident.
               
For these reasons I would allow the appeal and quash the conviction.",1968-10-22 00:00:00,High Court of Australia

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Perjury—Ground
of appeal—No evidence as to accused having been a witness—Motion for leave to
appeal to Supreme Court of Canada under s. 1024a Cr. Code—Alleged conflict with
decision in Rex v. Drummond (1905) 10 Ont. L.R. 546—Production at the
trial of the judgment in the civil action.

The appellant having been
found guilty of perjury committed in the trial of a civil action, one of the
grounds of appeal to the appellate court was that there had been no evidence
that the appellant was a witness in a judicial proceeding. The conviction
having been affirmed, the appellant moved for leave to appeal to this court
under s. 1024a Cr. Code, on the ground that the judgment sought to be appealed
from conflicts with a judgment of an Ontario appellate court in a like case: Rex v. Drummond
10 Ont. L.R. 546.

[Page 81]

Held that the decision in the Drummond Case did
not conflict with the judgment in this case: in the former case there was no
record whatever produced, while in the present case the copy of the pleadings
made use of as a record by the trial judge was put in evidence. The application
for leave to appeal was dismissed.

Semble that, although production, at the trial, of the
judgment disposing of the civil action was not necessary, it would have been
better practice that it should be put in in order to complete the record.

MOTION for leave to appeal to
the Supreme Court of Canada, under section 1024a of the Criminal Code, from the
judgment of the Court of Appeal for British
 Columbia[1] upholding the conviction of the appellant for
perjury in the trial of a civil action. The material facts of the case are
stated in the judgments now reported.

December 14, 1926.

ANGLIN C.J.C.—Motion for leave to
appeal under s. 1024 (a) of the Criminal Code on the ground that the
judgment sought to be appealed from conflicts with a judgment of the Ontario
Appellate Division in a like case. In the case at bar one of the grounds of
appeal to the Appellate Division was that

there is no evidence that
Gurditta was a witness in a judicial proceeding when he made the assertion
which is charged as a perjury.

The alleged perjury was committed
in the trial of the civil action of Brama v. Gurditta. At the
trial of the perjury charge the clerk of assize proved from the entries in his
court record that Gurditta had been sworn as a witness and had given evidence
on the trial of the civil action. The court stenographer proved the evidence
given by Gurditta at that trial. Counsel for the Crown put in evidence, as
exhibit I, the record prepared for the use of the judge at the trial pursuant
to rule 454, consisting of a certified copy of the endorsement upon the writ of
summons and of the statement of defence, being the whole of the pleadings. The
clerk of assize gave evidence that the case of Brama v. Gurditta,
in which this record was used, was tried at the assize held before Mr. Justice
Morrison on the 22nd of February, 1926, on which date the indictment charges
the

[Page 82]

perjury was committed. The
judgment disposing of the civil action does not appear to have been put in
evidence.

In the judgment of the Appellate
Division in the present proceeding Mr. Justice Martin, delivering the opinion
of the court, held, on the authority of Regina v. Scott[2]
, that it had been sufficiently established that Gurditta had given the
evidence on which the perjury charge rests in a judicial proceeding, i.e., upon
the trial before Mr. Justice Morrison of the civil action of Brama v. Gurditta
of which the record was put in evidence.

This conclusion is said to
conflict with the decision of the Ontario Appellate Division in Rex v. Drummond[3]
, followed in Rex v. Legros[4] ;
Rex v. Farrell [5]. As is
pointed out, however, by Osler J.A., in the Drummond Case[6],
at page 547, the only evidence there given was that of the clerk of assize for
the county of Brant who swore that the defendant Drummond had been called as a
witness on Kennedy's trial for murder and had been sworn by him as clerk of
assize; and he produced his record book containing entries shewing that the
defendant had given evidence at Kennedy's trial at which the alleged perjury
was committed. The only other evidence was that of the court stenographer who
related the evidence given by the accused at the Kennedy trial.

Neither the indictment on
which Drummond had been tried nor any copy, or sworn copy of it, was produced.

The court held that there was no
proper evidence of a fact essential to the proof of the crime charged, viz.,
that there had been a judicial proceeding in which the alleged perjury was
committed inasmuch as neither the indictment and formal record of such
proceeding or a certificate under s. 691 of the Criminal Code had been
produced.

I am unable to find any conflict
between the decision in the Drummond Case[7]
and the case now before me. In the Drummond Case[8]
there was no record whatever produced. Here the copy of the pleadings made use
of as a record by the trial judge was put in evidence. This suffices to dispose
of the application for leave under s. 1024 (a).

[Page 83]

I should perhaps add that, as at
present advised, production at the trial of the judgment disposing of the
action of Brama v. Gurditta was not necessary since the perjury
was complete when the evidence was given at the trial and prosecution could
have been instituted for it and conviction had although no judgment had ever
been rendered in the civil action. Doubtless it would be better practice where
judgment has been pronounced that it should be put in in order to complete the
record.

Leave to appeal will accordingly
be refused.

January 18, 1927.

ANGLIN C.J.C.—The defendant
renews his application for leave to appeal under s. 1024 (a) of the
Criminal Code, relying upon other opinions which have been delivered by judges
of the Appellate Division since his former motion for leave to appeal was
refused. As the case now stands three of the five members of the Appellate
Division (Martin, Galliher, and McPhillips JJ.A.) are of the opinion that it
was sufficiently proven at the trial that the defendant was a witness in a
judicial proceeding when he gave the evidence for the giving of which he has
been convicted of perjury. In the view of three members of the Appellate
Division (the Chief Justice, M. A. Macdonald and McPhillips JJ.A.), if the
proof was technically incomplete because of the omission to adduce evidence of
the writ of summons which began the civil action in which the alleged perjury
was committed,

no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice had actually occurred (s. 1014 (2) ).

I find nothing in the added
opinions now before me to bring this case within the purview of s. 1024 (a).
The Drummond Case[9]
is again invoked by the applicant as the judgment of another court of appeal
which conflicts with the judgment appealed from. My reasons for not regarding
the case of Rex v. Drummond[10]
as ""a like case"" I have already stated.

The motion will be refused.

Motion dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Possession of stolen
goods—Motion for nonsuit—Sufficiency of evidence or absence of evidence—Rule in
Hodge’s Case not applicable—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34,
s. 312.

Respondent was charged with being in
possession of two television sets knowing them to have been stolen. The Crown
presented no evidence and relied solely on the admissions of fact. These
disclose that the two television sets were loaded on a freight car which was
sealed when the car left Brockville and the seal upon which was unbroken when it arrived in Montreal. Neither of the consignees
received these television sets, which were found when the police searched the
premises of respondent. Respondent then filed a motion of nonsuit on the ground
that there was no evidence that the goods had been stolen. The judge of the
Court of Sessions of the Peace granted the motion. This decision was affirmed
by a majority of the Court of Appeal of Quebec. Hence the appeal to this Court.

Held (Laskin
C.J. and Spence and de Grandpré JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

Per Martland,
Judson, Ritchie, Pigeon, Dickson and Beetz JJ.: A motion for nonsuit cannot be
granted unless there is no evidence on which a jury acting reasonably might
have convicted the accused. The test propounded in Hodge’s Case (1838),
2 Lewin 227, 168 E.R. 1136, was concerned with the weight to be attached
to the evidence, whereas here the question is whether there is any evidence to
weigh. The admissions constitute evidence upon which a jury might reasonably
have concluded that the goods were stolen and that respondent knew that they
had been obtained by theft. Even if the facts can be otherwise interpreted, the
burden upon the Crown is not to negative every conjecture to which
circumstantial evidence might give rise and which might be consistent with the
innocence of the accused.

[Page 182]

Per Laskin
C.J. and Spence and de Grandpré JJ., dissenting: Even if there is
no question that on a motion for nonsuit the accused can only be released if
there is an absence of evidence, that does not mean that the motion must be
dismissed whenever there is an iota of evidence, no matter how inconsequential
this may be. In the case at bar theft was an essential element of the charge
and the Crown did not submit evidence that there was a theft in the car in
which the television sets were placed, or that the consignees were unlawfully
deprived of them. The doctrine of recent possession must be dismissed if its foundation,
namely the theft, is not established.

APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal
for Quebec, affirming a
judgment of the Court of Sessions of the Peace granting a motion for nonsuit.
Appeal allowed, Laskin C.J., Spence and de Grandpré JJ. dissenting.

G. Fortier and P. Sauvé, for the
appellant.

G. Thouin and Fernande Rainville-Laporte,
for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Spence and de
Grandpré JJ. was delivered by

DE GRANDPRÉ J. (dissenting)—The Crown
asks this Court to set aside a judgment of the Court of Sessions of the Peace
granting a motion of nonsuit, a judgment affirmed by a majority of the Court of
Appeal.

The indictment reads as follows:

[TRANSLATION] On or about January 12, 1972,
did unlawfully have in his possession two (2) R.C.A. Victor television sets, a Sylvania television set and a Phono-Sonic
stereo, the whole having a value of approximately $1,875, the property of
various persons, in which Canadian National has a special interest, knowing
that the said items were obtained by the commission in

[Page 183]

Canada of an
offence punishable by indictment, namely: a theft, committing thereby a
criminal offence, prescribed by s. 312 of the Criminal Code.

The appeal is concerned only with the two R.C.A.
Victor television sets, as the Crown admitted in the Quebec courts that it lacked sufficient evidence with respect to the other
two items.

In the case at bar the Crown summoned no
witnesses, relying solely on the following admissions:

[TRANSLATION] …the parties agree to admit
that:

(1) on January 11, 1972, two (2) R.C.A.
Victor television sets, produced as Exhibits P-1 and P-2 and here present in
the court, shipped to Paradis T.V. Enregistré of St‑Pascal, Province of
Quebec, and to Ouellet & Fils Limitée of Rimouski, Province of Quebec, were
delivered at Prescott, Province of Ontario, by Mr. Thomas Degroot, shipper
with R.C.A. Victor Limited, to Mr. Francis Ferguson, driver for Canadian
National;

(2) this delivery was recorded in two (2)
contracts of carriage numbered P-10 403 and P-14 01976, signed by
Messrs. Degroot and Ferguson;

(3) on the same day Mr. Ferguson
delivered the two (2) R.C.A. Victor television sets to Mr. Pervus
Dillabough at Brockville, Province of Ontario;

(4) this delivery was recorded on the
aforesaid contracts of carriage;

(5) Mr. Dillabough placed the two (2)
aforesaid television sets in car CN 523257 of train No. 212, originating at
Brockville and destined for Montreal, on January 11, 1972, and sealed the said
car CN 523257 with seal No. C 441889-90;

(6) in Montreal, at about five fifty-five (5:55) A.M. on January 12, 1972, Mr. Thrimp (according to
his testimony), the checker for Canadian National in Montreal, checked car No. CN 523257 in train No. 212, and found that the
seals were intact;

(7) Ouellet & Fils Limitée and Paradis
T.V. Enregistré did not receive the television sets they had ordered from
R.C.A. Victor Limited in Prescott;

(8) the aforesaid television sets, together
with a Sylvania set and a Phono-Sonic stereo, were found in a search conducted
by officers of Canadian National and the Montreal Police at the premises of the
accused, at

[Page 184]

about one-thirty (1:30) P.M. on January 14,
1972, at 8877 Tolhurst, in Montreal, Province of Quebec;

(9) if the police officers who carried out
the investigation were heard, they would identify the accused as the person on
whose premises they found the television sets on January 14, 1972.

The Crown having indicated that its evidence was
concluded after the presentation of the foregoing admissions, the defence
immediately moved for nonsuit; this motion was taken under reserve and finally
granted. On this point the transcript reads as follows:

[TRANSLATION] The Court grants the motion
of nonsuit and acquits the accused.

The Crown has not been able to present
evidence establishing the allegation beyond any doubt.

Further, in his oral judgment, the trial judge
said:

[TRANSLATION] I have concluded that the
motion for nonsuit should be granted, as the Crown has not established to my
satisfaction the commission of a prerequisite for the existence of the offence
as stated, namely a theft.

Brossard J., speaking for the majority of the
Court of Appeal, concluded that

[TRANSLATION] there is no evidence
on the record establishing that the aforesaid articles were actually stolen
(emphasis added).

Thus he concurs in the conclusion of the trial
judge, while emphasizing that the language used by the latter was not
especially well chosen, but that this could not have the effect of causing the
trial judgment to be set aside, if no valid evidence really existed in support
of one of the essential aspects of the information, namely theft. The relevant
paragraph from the reasons of Brossard J. is as follows:

[TRANSLATION] Undoubtedly the trial judge
would have been wiser not to go beyond the finding that no evidence of theft
existed, and add the opinion that, in any event, he did not have before him
evidence to support beyond any reasonable doubt a conviction of the accused of
unlawful possession of stolen goods, knowing them to be stolen; but this can
have no effect on the validity of the dismissal of the information for lack of
evidence of theft of the goods found in the possession of

[Page 185]

the respondent, and accordingly of any link
between such a theft and the possession of respondent.

Turgeon J. was of the same view, stating that
there existed no

[TRANSLATION] evidence of theft of the
articles found in the possession of respondent.

For his part, Lajoie J. summarized his
dissenting opinion in the following way:

[TRANSLATION] The motion for nonsuit could
only have been granted if there was a total lack of evidence against the
accused. If there was any basis for assessing the sufficiency of the evidence,
as in my opinion was the case here, the motion should have been dismissed and
the accused called to state whether or not he had a defence to present. The
judge could not proceed to assess the evidence and make a decision on the
merits until after the conclusion of that evidence on both sides.

Relying on this dissenting opinion the Crown
brought the case to this Court, stating the legal argument on which it relies
as follows:

[TRANSLATION] Did the Court of Appeal of
Quebec err in law in holding in its majority decision that there was a total
lack of evidence in the record of the essential element of theft required to
support the charge of unlawful possession of stolen goods?

There is no question that on a motion for
nonsuit the accused can only be released if there is an absence of evidence. In
this connection we need only refer to the remarks of Pigeon J. in The Queen
v. Kyling[1], at
p. 956:

Regarding the contents of the judge’s
report, I must respectfully point out that an absence, not an insufficiency, of
evidence is meant in the following reason: “the Crown did not adduce the
evidence necessary to show that the charge is well founded”.

In The King v. Morabito, [1949]
S.C.R. 172, this Court held that a nonsuit pronounced on a motion by the
defence after the close of the case for the Crown is a decision on a question
of law, namely the absence of evidence. This rule was also held applicable to
summary proceedings by the judgment in Feeley et al. v. The Queen, [1953]
1 S.C.R. 59. I have found nothing in the 1955 Criminal Code that
might imply a change in the principles underlying these judgments, nor has
anything to this effect been brought to our attention.

[Page 186]

As Pigeon J. points out, the applicable
principles were discussed more fully in Morabito and Feeley, and
I adopt the reasons expressed in those cases.

However, the expression “absence of evidence”
does not mean that the motion for a nonsuit must be dismissed whenever there is
an iota of evidence, no matter how inconsequential this may be. On the
contrary, a careful reading of Feeley, referred to above, discloses that
there were few iotas of evidence in that case. Appellants had been acquitted at
first instance on a motion for nonsuit, and the Court of Appeal had set aside
this acquittal and ordered a new trial. This Court unanimously reinstated the
judgment of acquittal with respect to three of the four appellants. Cartwright
J., as he then was, speaking for the Court, emphasized that the various aspects
of the evidence “taken together, are insufficient to make out a prima facie case”
(p. 64). This conclusion must be read in the light of the following paragraph,
taken from the reasons of Cartwright J. (at p. 60):

It is common ground that had the learned
Magistrate refused the motion the appellants would have had the right to call
evidence for the defence if so advised and counsel for the respondent submits
that the decision of this Court in The King v. Morabito establishes (i)
that at that stage it was not open to the learned Magistrate to dismiss the
charge unless there was no evidence on which, had the trial been before a jury,
a properly instructed jury, acting reasonably, might have convicted the
accused, and (ii) that whether or not there was such evidence is “a question of
law alone” within the meaning of section 1013(4) of the Code. I agree with
this submission.

In my view, therefore, the judges of the Court
of Appeal, on appeal by the Crown, applied the pertinent principles of law in
examining the record.

It must now be considered whether Brossard and
Turgeon JJ. were correct in concluding, as they did, that there was no evidence
on the record establishing theft of the two television sets, in the sense that
must be attributed to the phrase “absence of evidence”. On this point, Brossard
J. observes:

[Page 187]

[TRANSLATION] In my opinion counsel for the
respondent correctly maintained that there was no evidence on the record
establishing that the aforesaid articles were actually stolen; the most that
could be inferred from the Crown evidence and the admissions was that at some
point, not specified, these articles, under circumstances that were not
established, ceased to be in the possession of the carrier, and were not
subsequently delivered into the actual possession of their original consignees.
In my view, this evidence could not serve as the foundation of evidence of
commission of a theft, whether from the shipper or the consignees. Conjectures
and assumptions do not constitute evidence of the unlawfulness of possession.

I consider that this conclusion was correct.

In a case such as that before the Court, where
the indictment charges respondent with unlawful possession of stolen articles,
knowing that those articles were obtained by the commission of a theft, theft
is an essential element which has to be established by the Crown: Geist v.
The Queen[2], (Court
of Appeal of Quebec); R. v. Vogelle and Reid[3], (Court of Appeal of Manitoba); R.
v. Gowing[4], (Court
of Appeal of Alberta).

If the Crown submits no evidence (in the sense
defined above) of the commission of a theft, an accused who makes a motion for
nonsuit must be acquitted. Moreover, the Crown concedes the merit of these
principles, since it relies in its factum on [TRANSLATION] “proof that the
buyers had not alienated the goods”, “the absence of evidence of any title in
the accused to the said goods”, and “the other circumstances of the case”. In
the case at bar, I have read and re-read the admissions which constitute the
Crown’s only evidence, and I find absolutely no proof

(a) that there was in fact a theft in the car in
which the television sets were placed; on the contrary, the last time this car
was examined (para. six of the admissions) the seals were intact;

(b) that the consignees, namely Ouellet and
Paradis, were unlawfully deprived of the televi-

[Page 188]

son sets; on the contrary, the only statement to
be found in the admissions (para. seven) is that they were not received, but it
is in no way alleged that such non-delivery was against their will.

The record thus contains no evidence of the
theft alleged in the indictment, and consequently the entire argument of the
Crown based on “recent possession” must be dismissed, since the foundation of
that argument, namely the theft, was not established.

For all these reasons, I would affirm the
judgment of the Court of Appeal and the acquittal of respondent.

The judgment of Martland, Judson, Ritchie,
Pigeon, Dickson and Beetz JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal from a judgment of
the Court of Appeal of the Province of Quebec affirming the judgment rendered
at trial in the “Cour des Sessions”, whereby the learned trial judge granted
the motion for nonsuit advanced by the present respondent at his trial on a
charge of being in possession of stolen goods knowing them to have been stolen,
on the ground that there was no evidence that the goods found in the
respondent’s pessession had been stolen. The conclusion of the learned trial
judge, which was affirmed by a majority of the Court of Appeal (Lajoie J.
dissenting) was phrased as follows:

[TRANSLATION] I have concluded that the
motion for nonsuit should be granted, as the Crown has not established to my
satisfaction the commission of a prerequisite for the existence of the offence
as stated, namely a theft.

The Crown presented no evidence and this appeal
falls to be determined in accordance with a statement of admitted facts which
has been recited by Mr. Justice de Grandpré in the course of the reasons
for judgment which he has prepared for delivery in this appeal.

In summary, these facts disclose that two R.C.A.
Victor television sets produced at the trial had been shipped from Prescott,
Ontario, by the C.N. Railway, one to Paradis T.V. Enregistré of St-Pascal and
the other to Ouellet et Fils Limitée

[Page 189]

of Rimouski, and that these sets were loaded on
a freight car which was sealed and the seal upon which had not been broken when
it arrived in Montreal in the early hours of January 12, 1972. Neither of the
consignees received these television sets, both of which were found when the
police searched the premises of the respondent in Montreal on January 14, 1972.

It was agreed also that if the police officers
who effected the search had been heard at the trial they could have identified
the accused as the person in whose premises the television sets were found.

The position of a Magistrate in considering a
motion for nonsuit is authoritatively described by Cartwright J., as he then
was, in Feeley and others v. The Queen[5],
at p. 61 where, after making reference to the case of R. v.
Morabito[6], he
adopts the submission

…that at that stage it was not open to the
learned Magistrate to dismiss the charge unless there was no evidence on which,
had the trial been before a jury, a properly instructed jury, acting
reasonably, might have convicted the accused, and (ii) that whether or
not there was such evidence is “a question of law alone” within the meaning of
section 1013(4) of the Code.

The underlining is my own.

On the admitted facts the two television sets
were known to have been in a sealed C.N.R. freight car in Montreal en route to
their respective destinations at St-Pascal and Rimouski in the early hours of January
12th. They were never received by the consignees, but two and a half days later
had found their way to the respondent’s premises in Montreal and I am of
opinion that from these facts a properly instructed jury might reasonably have
drawn the inference that they did not get there without having been stolen by
somebody.

It is suggested, however that as the evidence
disclosed by the admissions is purely circumstantial, the proper test to be
employed in assessing the

[Page 190]

weight to be attached to it is that first
propounded by Baron Alderson in charging the jury in Hodge’s Case[7], which was adopted by Sir Lyman
Duff, C.J., on behalf of this Court in R. v. Comba[8]. This test is, however, to be read
in light of what was said by Spence J., speaking on behalf of the majority of
this Court in R. v. Mitchell[9], at
p. 478, where he said:

Does the fact that evidence is
circumstantial necessarily require that an instruction be given to the jury in
accordance with that which was given in Hodge’s Case!

To answer this question it is desirable to
recall just what were the circumstances of Hodge’s case. The report
states that the prisoner was charged with murder, the case was one of
circumstantial evidence altogether, and contained no one fact which, taken
alone, amounted to a presumption of guilt.

Baron Alderson told the jury that the case
was made up of circumstances entirely; and that, before they could find the
prisoner guilty, they must be satisfied, not only that those circumstances were
consistent with his having committed the act, but they must also be satisfied
that the facts were such as to be inconsistent with any other rational
conclusion than that the prisoner was the guilty person.

It is quite clear that this direction
was concerned only with the identification of the accused as being the person
who had committed the crime. (The underlining is my
own)

This statement was reaffirmed in R. v.
Bagshaw[10], at
p. 6. (a case of theft).

We are not concerned here with the
identification of the thief. The issue is not who stole the goods, but whether
there is any evidence justifying the inference that they were stolen. It should
be observed also that the rule in Hodge’s Case, supra, which was
reaffirmed in R.v. Comba, supra, was concerned with the weight to
be attached to the evidence, whereas here the question is whether there was any
evidence to weigh.

It is admitted that the goods in question were
found in the accused’s home on January 14, 1972, and if the admissions
constitute evidence upon

[Page 191]

which a properly instructed jury might
reasonably have concluded that the goods were stolen, it would follow that they
might also have concluded that the respondent knew that they had been obtained
by theft in accordance with the rebut-table presumption to which such possession
would give rise. See R. v. Schama: R. v. Abramovitch[11], Ungaro v. The King[12], and many other cases in this
Court.

It is said, however, that the admitted facts are
capable of being construed as leading to other rational conclusions than the
theft of the goods such as the conclusion that the consignees were a party to
their goods being diverted from the custody of the railway company to the home
of the accused. As to this contention reference may be had to the statement
made by McRuer, C.J.H.C. in R. v. Mclver[13], at p. 309, which was adopted
in this Court in Wild v. The Queen[14],
and in R. v. Bagshaw, supra, and where it is said:

The rule (in Hodge’s Case) makes it clear
that the case is to be decided on the facts, that is, the facts proved in
evidence and the conclusions alternative to the guilt of the accused must be
rational conclusions based on inferences drawn from proven facts. No conclusion
can be a rational conclusion that is not founded on evidence. Such a conclusion
would be a speculative, imaginative conclusion, not a rational one.

I do not think that the burden resting upon the
Crown to establish the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt includes
the added burden of negativing every conjecture to which circumstantial
evidence might give rise and which might be consistent with the innocence of
the accused.

As I have indicated, however, I do not think
that the judgment of Sir Lyman Duff in the Comba Case, supra, in which
he reiterates the rule in Hodge s Case has any application to the circumstances
here disclosed. I am rather of opinion, as indicated by Mr. Justice Pigeon
in R. v. Kyling[15],

[Page 192]

at p. 957, that the true test to be applied
before granting a nonsuit is whether the Crown evidence gives rise merely to a
suspicion or whether it is such as to justify the drawing of an inference.

In my view the facts disclosed in the admissions
are such that a properly instructed jury might reasonably draw the inference
that the goods had been stolen, and as there was no evidence to support any
other rational conclusion, I am of opinion that this was not an appropriate
case in which to grant an order of nonsuit, and I would accordingly allow the
appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and the verdict of
acquittal and direct a new trial.

publicity ‑‑ Accused seeking to challenge each prospective juror
for cause on the ground of partiality ‑‑ Judge not permitting
questions to be put to all prospective jurors ‑‑ Whether accused
properly denied right to challenge.

 

                   Appellant was
convicted of killing of a pimp.  Media publicity was given to the search for
and the location of the victim's body, his background and identity, and his
involvement in certain killings in the United States.  The accused's background
was also the subject of some media speculation.  These reports occurred
approximately nine to ten months prior to the trial of the accused.  The
accused sought to challenge for cause each potential juror because of the
potential for partiality arising from the pre‑trial publicity and had
prepared a list of eleven questions to be asked of each member of the jury
panel.  This general challenge was rejected by the trial judge and an appeal to
the Court of Appeal was dismissed.  At issue here is whether the accused was
properly denied the ability to challenge each prospective juror for cause on
the ground of partiality.

 

                   Held:  The appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   Per L'Heureux‑Dubé, Sopinka,
Gonthier, and Cory JJ.:  The jury must perform its duties impartially and
represent the larger community as far as is possible and appropriate in the
circumstances.

 

                   The fundamental
right to a fair and proper trial is denied where the accused is not allowed to
challenge any number of jurors for cause when the grounds of challenge are
properly specified.  Counsel is entitled to determine whether any potential
juror is, by reason of the pretrial publicity and the notoriety of the
appellant, sufficiently impartial.  The trial judge cannot, in the exercise of
his discretion in the area of admitting grounds of challenge for cause and
settling the questions, effectively curtail the statutory right to challenge
for cause.  That trial judges have a wide discretion in these matters and that
jurors will usually behave in accordance with their oaths cannot supercede the
right of every accused person to a fair trial, which necessarily includes the
empanelling of an impartial jury.

 

                   An accused does not
have the right to a favourable jury and the selection procedure cannot be used
to thwart the representativeness that is essential to the proper functioning of
a jury.  Peremptory challenges, however, are justified on a number of grounds
even though they, along with the Crown's right to stand aside, can be used to
alter somewhat the degree to which the jury represents the community.  Challenges
for cause are properly used to rid the jury of prospective members who are not
indifferent or who otherwise fall within s. 567  of the
Criminal Code , but
they stray into illegitimacy if used merely, without more, to over‑ or
under‑represent a certain class in society or as a ""fishing
expedition"" in order to obtain personal information about the juror. 
Information obtained on an ultimately unsuccessful challenge for cause may,
however, lead the challenger to exercise the right to challenge peremptorily or
to stand aside the particular juror.

 

                   The issue raised in
a challenge for cause is tried by a ""mini‑jury"" of two jurors
or two prospective jurors if no jurors have been sworn.  Section 567  of the
Criminal Code  places
little, if any, burden on the challenger.  On the other hand, a reasonable
degree of control must be retained by the trial judge and, thus, some burden
placed upon the challenger to ensure that the selection of the jury occurs in a
manner that is in accordance with the principles here articulated and also to
ensure that sufficient information is imparted to the trial judge such that the
trial of the truth of the challenge is contained within permissible bounds. 
Thus, while there must be an ""air of reality"" to the application, it
need not be an ""extreme"" case.  The real question to be decided here
was whether the particular publicity and notoriety of the accused could
potentially have the effect of destroying the prospective juror's indifference
between the Crown and the accused.

 

                   A valuable
distinction might be drawn in pre‑trial publicity cases between mere
publication of the facts of a case and situations where the media misrepresents
the evidence, dredges up and widely publicizes discreditable incidents from an
accused's past or engages in speculation as to the accused's guilt or
innocence.  It may well be that the pre‑trial publicity or other ground
of alleged partiality will, in itself, provide sufficient reasons for a
challenge for cause.  The threshold question is not whether the ground of
alleged partiality will create such partiality in a juror, but rather whether
it could create that partiality which would prevent a juror from being
indifferent as to the result.  In the end, there must exist a realistic potential
for the existence of partiality, on a ground sufficiently articulated in the
application, before the challenger should be allowed to proceed.

 

                   Per Stevenson J.:  Concurrence with the
reasons and disposition of L'Heureux‑Dubé J. was restricted to the main
ground of the appeal:  whether the trial judge had usurped the function of
triers of facts in dealing with challenges for cause.  Where counsel seeks to
invoke the right to challenge each juror the trial judge is to be satisfied
that there is some foundation to the challenge.  Here the challenge for cause
on the basis of pre‑trial publicity was groundless.  Giving some rational
basis for exercising the peremptory challenge is not a permissible ground for
challenging for cause.

//L'Heureux-Dubé
J.//

 

                   The judgment of
L'Heureux-Dubé, Sopinka, Gonthier, Cory and Stevenson JJ. was delivered by

 

                   L'Heureux-Dubé
J. -- The sole issue
raised by this case is the proper interpretation of the challenge for cause
provisions found in the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34.  More specifically, the
question is whether the accused in this case was properly denied the ability to
challenge each prospective juror for cause on the ground of partiality or, in
the words of the section, non-indifference.

 

Facts

 

                   The accused was
charged and convicted in the killing of a pimp by the name of Tommy T.  The
nature of the dispute between the two men and the facts surrounding the actual
killing of Tommy T. are not in issue here.  Of importance to the legal question
raised are the facts surrounding the search for the victim's body.

 

                   The crime was
committed in Winnipeg, Manitoba, but the accused was picked up for questioning
in Dryden, Ontario.  On this occasion, he informed the police that he had
killed Tommy T.  A more detailed statement was given by the accused upon
questioning by the Winnipeg police authorities.  He told the police about the
nature of the dispute between the two men and described the circumstances
surrounding the actual killing.  According to the accused's statement to the
Winnipeg police, he had disposed of the body in a commercial garbage bin. 
Unfortunately, by the time the accused was transported back to Manitoba, the
bin in question had been emptied.  As a result, the police searched the local
land fill site in hopes of locating the body.  This search was the subject of
some publicity by the media.  The media raised questions about the location of
the body and about the background and identity of the victim and his
involvement in certain killings in the United States.  The background of the
accused was also apparently the subject of some media speculation.  The reports
in the media occurred approximately nine to ten months prior to the trial of
the accused.

 

                   It is against this
factual background that the legal question must be analyzed.

 

Relevant statutory provisions

 

                   Narrowly, only
Criminal Code s.
567(1) (b)
(now s. 638(1) (b))
is relevant to the disposition in this case.  However, for ease of reference
and in the interest of clarity, I will set out other Criminal Code  provisions regarding the empanelling
of a jury in the criminal context. 

 

Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.
C-34, as am.:

 

                   554. (1) A person who is qualified as a
juror according to, and summoned as a juror in accordance with, the laws of a
province is qualified to serve as a juror in criminal proceedings in that
province.

 

                   562. (1)  An accused who is charged with
high treason or first degree murder is entitled to challenge twenty jurors
peremptorily.

 

                   (2)
An accused who is charged with an offence, not being high treason or first
degree murder, for which he may be sentenced to imprisonment for more than five
years is entitled to challenge twelve jurors peremptorily.

 

                   (3)
An accused who is charged with an offence that is not referred to in subsection
(1) or (2) is entitled to challenge four jurors peremptorily.

 

                   563. (1)  The prosecutor is entitled to
challenge four jurors peremptorily, and may direct any number of jurors who are
not challenged peremptorily by the accused to stand by until all the jurors
have been called who are available for the purpose of trying the indictment.

 

                   (2)
Notwithstanding subsection (1), the prosecutor may not direct more than
forty-eight jurors to stand by unless the presiding judge for special cause to
be shown, so orders.

 

                   (3)
The accused may be called upon to declare whether he challenges a juror
peremptorily or for cause before the prosecutor is called upon to declare
whether he requires the juror to stand by, or challenges him peremptorily or
for cause.

 

                   567. (1)  A prosecutor or an accused is
entitled to any number of challenges on the ground that

 

(a) the name of the juror does not
appear on the panel, but no misnomer or misdescription is a ground of challenge
where it appears to the court that the description given on the panel
sufficiently designates the person referred to,

 

(b) a juror is not indifferent
between the Queen and the accused, 

 

(c) a juror has been convicted of an
offence for which he was sentenced to death or to a term of imprisonment
exceeding twelve months,

 

(d) a juror is an alien,

 

(e) a juror is physically unable to
perform properly the duties of a juror, or

 

                                                                   .
. . 

 

                   (2)
No challenge for cause shall be allowed on a ground not mentioned in subsection
(1).

 

                   569. (1) Where the ground of a challenge
is that the name of a juror does not appear on the panel, the issue shall be
tried by the judge on the voir dire by the inspection of the panel, and
such other evidence that the judge thinks fit to receive.

 

                   (2)
Where the ground of a challenge is one not mentioned in subsection (1), the two
jurors who were last sworn, or if no jurors have then been sworn, two persons
present whom the court may appoint for the purpose, shall be sworn to determine
whether the ground of challenge is true.

 

                   (3)
Where the finding, pursuant to subsection (1) or (2) is that the ground of
challenge is not true, the juror shall be sworn, but if the finding is that the
ground of challenge is true, the juror shall not be sworn.  [Emphasis added.]

 

Judgments

 

Court
of Queen's Bench
(Jewers J.)

 

                   At trial, in May,
1988, counsel for the accused informed the judge that he wished to challenge
for cause each prospective juror on the ground that they were not
""indifferent between the Queen and the accused"".  The allegation of
potential partiality was based upon the pre-trial publicity described above. 
Counsel for the accused had prepared a list of eleven questions which he
desired to put to each member of the jury panel.  He argued that the
speculation in the media went to the background and character of the accused
and, hence, could prove prejudicial absent individual questioning of the
prospective jurors on the basis of the eleven questions.

 

                   The Crown responded
that the pre-trial publicity could not form the basis for the accused's
challenge as it had occurred some nine or ten months prior to trial.  Further,
it was the Crown's contention that the media reports were not prejudicial as
they failed to establish any connection between the search and discovery of the
body of Tommy T. and the arrest of the accused.

 

                   The trial judge was
not persuaded by the arguments of the accused and rejected the general
challenge on the ground of partiality.  He concluded in this fashion:

 

                   Well,
in this particular case, first of all I don't really have any evidence as to the
type or the extent of the publicity that was given to this case, unless I can
take judicial notice of it which I do not think I can do.

 

                   However
I am not persuaded on the basis of what has been told to me that there has
been so much publicity about the case, and in particular so much publicity
about the notoriety surrounding the accused, that this is a case which would
call for the questioning of jurors prior to their being sworn in.

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

                   I
am just not persuaded that this is a case where we should go to the
extraordinary process of questioning the jurors, and so the application is
dismissed.

 

                   Of
course if there is some specific reason to challenge a jury on the grounds of
impartiality or lack of impartiality, or any other reason, I naturally would be
prepared to entertain that. . . . [Emphasis added.]

 

Court
of Appeal (Huband
J.A. for the majority, O'Sullivan J.A. in dissent) (1989), 58 Man. R. (2d) 145

 

                   On appeal to the
Court of Appeal, the accused alleged a number of errors in the trial judge's
charge to the jury.  Since this is an appeal as of right, arising out of the
dissent on a point of law at the Court of Appeal, none of these issues is
relevant here.  As stated at the outset, the only issue in this appeal is the
propriety of the procedure adopted by the trial judge regarding the accused's
request to challenge for cause each prospective juror on the basis of
partiality.

 

                   The majority of the
Court of Appeal considered at length the argument of the accused that the trial
judge should have allowed individual questioning of the prospective jurors
rather than acceding to the request of the Crown that, in the circumstances of
the case, the alleged partiality was properly dealt with through a general
admonition by the trial judge.  Huband J.A., for the majority, pointed out that
the trial judge: (1) did not close the challenge procedure off completely but
held that challenges on ""proper"" grounds could proceed, (2) told all
members of the panel that if any of them had formed a steadfast opinion about
the guilt or innocence of the accused, they should excuse themselves and, (3)
only after this instruction allowed the selection to begin.

 

                   In concluding that
the accused could not succeed on this ground, the majority relied heavily upon
the reasons of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Hubbert (1975), 29 C.C.C. (2d) 279, and this
Court's subsequent endorsement of those reasons found at [1977] 2 S.C.R. 267. 
Huband J.A. noted that in Hubbert, supra, the Ontario Court of
Appeal reasoned that pre-trial publicity should not normally form the basis of
a general challenge for cause.  At p. 150 the majority stated:

 

                   Relying
upon the Hubbert case, the learned trial judge was right in exercising
his discretion to refuse challenge for cause on the basis of pretrial
publicity.  He was right to refuse to allow challenge on the basis of the other
questions contained on the list, since, in the main, these matters were covered
by his general remarks.  In controlling the process as he did, in my opinion
the learned trial judge did not interfere in any way with the right of the
accused to a fair trial before an impartial jury.

 

                   Huband J.A. went on
to discuss the case law subsequent to Hubbert, supra.  He noted
that this Court's reasons in R. v. Barrow, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 694, might be construed as
limiting the reasons of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Hubbert, supra. 
The majority concluded, however, that Barrow, supra, should not
be read in this fashion.

 

                   O'Sullivan J.A., in
dissent, disagreed with the majority's interpretation of this Court's reasons
in Barrow, supra, and held that the trial judge proceeded
improperly in rejecting the general challenge by the accused.  He also felt
that the majority failed to consider adequately what was said by the Quebec
Court of Appeal in R. v. Guérin and Pimparé (1984), 13 C.C.C. (3d) 231.  O'Sullivan J.A.
quoted extensively from the three opinions rendered in Guérin and Pimparé,
supra, and concluded that they cast doubt on the propriety of the
procedure adopted in the present case.  In attempting to reconcile what he felt
were the conflicting judgments in Barrow, supra, Guérin and Pimparé, supra,
and Hubbert, supra, O'Sullivan J.A. stated, at p. 155:

 

                   If
the law were left in the state where the Ontario Court of Appeal ruled one way
and the Quebec Court of Appeal ruled another, I would have been inclined to
follow the Ontario Court of Appeal supported as it is by the remarks of the
Supreme Court itself in dismissing the appeal from it. . . . 

 

                   However,
I am confronted with the judgment of Dickson, C.J.C. ... 

 

                   It
is true that it may be said that what Dickson, C.J.C., said in Barrow,
supra, is obiter dictum; it is nevertheless entitled to our respect and we
should follow the dicta in the absence of some special reason not to do so.

 

                   O'Sullivan J.A., in
reliance on his interpretation of Barrow, supra, concluded that the trial judge
was indeed in error in rejecting the requested challenge in this case and would
have ordered a new trial.

 

Issues

 

                   While the appellant
sets out three issues arising from the dissent at the Court of Appeal, they all
have at their core the proper interpretation and application of the challenge
for cause provisions of the Criminal Code .  Therefore, as I mentioned at the outset, this
is the sole issue that will be addressed in these reasons.

 

Analysis

 

The
Criminal Code  Procedure Regarding the Empanelling of a Jury

 

                   In order to place
the issue raised by this case within its proper context, I will examine the
Criminal Code 
provisions governing the empanelling of juries.  Prior, however, to this
discussion I will briefly describe the role of provincial legislation in the
area of jury selection.

 

                   Jury selection has
both federal and provincial aspects.  Section 91(27)  of the
Constitution Act, 1867 
gives Parliament jurisdiction over ""The Criminal Law"" including
""the Procedure in Criminal Matters.""  Section 92(14)  awards to the
provinces jurisdiction over ""The Administration of Justice in the
Province"".  ""Out-of-court"" selection, i.e., selection of those
individuals who are able to serve as jurors, is typically governed by the
provincial Jury Acts.  (For a good summary of provincial legislation in this
regard see Schulman and Myers, ""Jury Selection"", in
Studies on the Jury,
Law Reform Commission of Canada (1979), at p. 395.)  Jurisdictional conflict in
this area is avoided through s. 554(1)  (now s. 626 ) of the
Criminal Code  which
provides that the jury panel will be selected from lists drawn up according to
the relevant provincial legislation.

 

                   The
""in-court"" selection procedure is a matter falling within the
jurisdiction of Parliament and is dealt with at length in the
Criminal Code .  This
Court has previously considered the respective ability of the provinces and
Parliament to legislate in this area in R. v. Barrow, supra.

 

                   In setting out a
summary of the Criminal Code  provisions I have gained a large measure of
assistance from the work of Salhany, Canadian
Criminal Procedure
(5th ed.)  (See also ""The Jury in the Criminal Trial"" by Alan Gold in
Vincent M. Del Buono, ed., Criminal Procedure in Canada)  Immediately
after an accused has pleaded to the charge the empanelling of a jury begins. 
Very simply, if no successful challenge is made to the initial array, the names
of the jurors will be drawn at random.  As each prospective juror is called,
either the accused or the Crown can challenge the juror, either peremptorily or
for cause, or the Crown can direct the juror to stand aside.  If no successful
challenge is made and neither side exercises its ability to reject or stand
aside, the juror will be sworn.  The form of challenge that we are concerned
with here, a challenge to the poll, is a challenge directed against individual
jurors.  This type of challenge can be either peremptory, without any grounds,
or for cause.

 

                   Section 562 (now s.
633) of the Criminal Code  deals with peremptory challenges by an accused. 
It provides that an accused has a varying number of peremptory challenges
depending upon the nature of the sentence that can be imposed.  An accused
charged with high treason or first degree murder is allowed twenty peremptory
challenges.  If the offence charged is not caught by the above category but is
one for which imprisonment for a term greater than five years is possible, the
accused is allowed 12 peremptory challenges.  Any accused not falling within
the two previous categories is allowed four peremptory challenges.

 

                   The ability of the
Crown to challenge peremptorily or, alternatively, stand aside jurors, is found
in s. 563(1) (now s. 634(1)) of the Code.  While the Crown can only challenge
peremptorily four times, it is allowed to stand aside 48 jurors.  The ability
of the Crown to stand aside jurors is, in some respects, similar to an
accused's ability to challenge for cause except that the challenge is postponed
until it is determined that a full jury cannot be formed without those asked to
stand aside.  The right of the Crown to stand aside jurors, though it appears
somewhat anomalous in the present legislative scheme, finds its origin in the
fact that, at common law, the Crown was given no ability to challenge
peremptorily.  (The Law Reform Commission of Canada in The
Jury in Criminal Trials,
Working Paper 27, 1980, recommended the abolition of ""stand-asides"",
to be replaced with peremptory challenges in the same number as is allowed the
accused in any given case.)

 

                   Section 563(3) (now
s. 634(3)) of the Code provides that the accused must determine whether he or she will
challenge a juror for cause or otherwise before the Crown can be called upon to
make a decision as regards the particular juror.

 

                   As far as
challenges for cause are concerned, both the accused and the Crown have a
theoretically unlimited ability to challenge for cause.  Section 567(1)  (now s.
638(1)) sets out the exclusive grounds upon which a challenge for cause can be
made.  Under s. 569 (now s. 640) the trial of the truth of the challenge for
cause is heard by the last two jurors sworn.  If no jurors have yet been sworn,
then two prospective jurors are appointed by the Court to hear and decide the
challenge.  If these triers decide that the challenge is valid, the juror will
not be sworn.  If, however, they find that the challenge is groundless, the
juror must be sworn unless either side decides to exercise a peremptory
challenge or stand aside.  The decision of the triers is final and no appeal
lies therefrom.

 

                   This, in brief, is
the larger context within which a challenge for cause can arise.  This context
and the proper interpretation of the text of the legislation governing the
empanelling procedure are important in a resolution of the question before this
Court.  The bare words of the provisions provide little guidance, however,
without an examination of the history and principles underlying them.

 

The Evolution of the Modern Jury

 

                   A brief overview of
the evolution of the jury serves to bring into sharp relief the important
functions that juries serve.  These functions and the principles that inform
them play a crucial role in the consideration of the issue presently before
this Court.

 

                   While the exact
origin of the jury, as we now know it, is difficult to trace, it is commonly
believed that most early societies possessed some sort of adjudicative
structure similar in form and purpose to that which serves our system today. 
Moore, in a comprehensive examination of the history of the jury, The
Jury, Tool of Kings, Palladium of Liberty, records the use of jury-like bodies as early as
the time of Solon in the 7th and 6th centuries B.C.  The most democratic of
these early institutions were the Athenian general assemblies.  The forebearer
of our modern jury, however, is widely thought to be the Frankish
inquisitio whereby
local men, with knowledge of the matter in dispute, swore to tell the truth
upon a question put to them by the judge.  Only matters in which the Crown had
an interest were resolved in this fashion.  Subsequent English influence
moulded this Crown-controlled instrument into what it is today.  Moore,
supra, summarizes
this later history, at p. 14:

 

                   The
inquisitio of the
Franks had its accusatory aspects (which anticipated our modern grand jury) and
its civil aspects, which was a mode of proof by inquisition or interrogation. 
The next step in the evolution of the trial jury was the Anglo-Norman jury of
proof.  The jurors themselves were the witnesses and they were the mode of
proof.  . . .  The final step in the jury's development was the judgment jury
which came into being in England in the fourteenth century.  In this last step,
the jury, instead of being a mode of proof, chose between the proofs or
evidence offered by the parties.

 

                   Interestingly,
early juries were chosen for their knowledge of the issue whereas, at present,
such knowledge and the pre-judgment that may accompany it might very well lead
to disqualification.  However, as the function of the jury evolved and its
domain narrowed, principles not unlike those underlying our challenge procedure
evolved.  (See Moore, supra, at p. 56;  Baker, An Introduction to English Legal
History, at pp.
64-66; Schulman and Myers, supra, at p. 423, and Devlin, Trial by Jury, at p. 67).

 

                   Moore informs us
that much of what constitutes our present procedure in challenging prospective
jurors and the grounds upon which such challenges could take place developed in
the 16th and 17th centuries in England.  Thus, the number of challenges, the
types of challenge allocated to each party and the grounds upon which such
challenges could be based were formalized early in the modern development of
the jury. (See also Schulman and Myers, supra, at pp. 425-28.)

 

                   Importantly, the
development of the institution known as the jury and the process through which
it came to be selected was neither fortuitous nor arbitrary but proceeded upon
the strength of a certain vision of the role that that body should play.  Most
of the early rationales for the use of the jury are as compelling today as they
were centuries ago while other, more modern, rationales have developed.  The
Law Reform Commission of Canada in its 1980 Working Paper, The
Jury in Criminal Trials,
sets out numerous rationales for the past and continued existence of the jury. 
The jury, through its collective decision making, is an excellent fact finder;
due to its representative character, it acts as the conscience of the
community; the jury can act as the final bulwark against oppressive laws or
their enforcement; it provides a means whereby the public increases its
knowledge of the criminal justice system and it increases, through the
involvement of the public, societal trust in the system as a whole.

 

                   These rationales or
functions of the jury continue to inform the development of the jury and our
interpretation of legislation governing the selection of individual jurors. 
The modern jury was not meant to be a tool in the hands of either the Crown or
the accused and indoctrinated as such through the challenge procedure, but
rather was envisioned as a representative cross-section of society, honestly
and fairly chosen.  Any other vision may run counter to the very rationales
underlying the existence of such a body.  As Moore, supra, comments, it is only recently that
any real representation of society by juries has been achieved in most Western
nations.  He describes the American experience in these words at p. 231:

 

In
1791, a party to a civil or a criminal case was entitled to a 12 member, male,
white, unanimous jury.

 

                   Increasingly,
however, many countries have since repealed property, sex and race
qualifications for jurors and have legislated other expansions in the number of
citizens eligible for jury duty.  (For the English legislative experience see
the Morris Committee, Report of the Departmental Committee on Jury Service,
Command Paper No. 2627; see also Blake, ""The Case for the Jury"", in
Findlay and Duff, eds., The Jury Under Attack, at p. 142.)  These later developments only
serve to underscore the previously articulated rationales for the existence of
the jury.

 

                   The importance of
the jury in our system of criminal justice past and present is eloquently
described by Blackstone in his Commentaries, Book 4, at p. 1735:

 

So
that the liberties of England cannot but subsist so long as this palladium
remains sacred and inviolate; not only from all open attacks, (which none will
be so hardy as to make,) but also from all secret machinations which may sap
and undermine it; by introducing new and arbitrary methods of trial, . . . And,
however convenient these may appear at first, (as doubtless all
arbitrary powers, well executed, are the most convenient,) yet let it be
again remembered that delays and little inconveniences in the forms of justice
are the price that all free nations must pay for their liberty in more
substantial matters; that these inroads upon this sacred bulwark of the nation
are fundamentally opposite to the spirit of our constitution; . . . [Footnotes
omitted.]

 

                   Section 11 (f) of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  enshrines the right to trial by jury with these words:

 

                   11. 
Any person charged
with an offence has the right 

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

(f) except in the case of an offence
under military law tried before a military tribunal, to the benefit of trial by
jury where the maximum punishment for the offence is imprisonment for five
years or a more severe punishment; 

 

                   The perceived
importance of the jury and the Charter  right to jury trial is meaningless
without some guarantee that it will perform its duties impartially and
represent, as far as is possible and appropriate in the circumstances, the
larger community.  Indeed, without the two characteristics of impartiality and
representativeness, a jury would be unable to perform properly many of the
functions that make its existence desirable in the first place.  Provincial
legislation guarantees representativeness, at least in the initial array.  The
random selection process, coupled with the sources from which this selection is
made, ensures the representativeness of Canadian criminal juries.  (See the
provincial Jury Acts.)  Thus, little if any objection can be made regarding
this crucial characteristic of juries.  Schulman and Myers,
supra, make this
clear at p. 408 of their discussion:

 

                   Jury
qualification requirements in Canadian provinces are considerably different
than those in the United States or England.  The American Bar Association
standards for trial by jury, as recommended by the Advisory Committee on the
Criminal Trial, say that -- ""The names of those persons who may be called
for jury service should be selected at random from sources which will furnish a
representative cross-section of the community.""  Canadian laws by and
large have long met the standard.  [Footnotes omitted, emphasis added.]

 

                   However, the
""in-court"" selection procedure, set out in the
Criminal Code , can
impact on the representativeness of the jury in some situations.  The
impartiality of the jury is controlled in the main through the
Criminal Code 
procedure.  Section 11 (d)
of the Charter  further buttresses the requirement of impartiality:

 

                   11. 
Any person charged
with an offence has the right 

 

                                                                   .
. . 

 

(d) to be presumed innocent until proven
guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and
impartial tribunal;

 

                   In order, then, to
be meaningful, the application of the Criminal Code  provisions must be informed by these
larger expressions of principle.

 

                   Prior to applying
these principles to the case before us, it is necessary to discuss previous
Canadian case law.  In so doing, owing to the nature of a partiality allegation,
the facts of each case will be significant.

 

Canadian
Case Law

 

                    The pivotal and
most recent decisions in this area are R. v. Hubbert, supra, R. v. Guérin and Pimparé, supra,
and R. v. Barrow, supra.  I will, therefore, focus on these cases and
discuss them at length, given, in particular, the confusion which may exist in
their interpretation, as evidenced by the dissent in the Court of Appeal in the
present case.

 

                   In Hubbert, supra,
counsel for the accused wished to challenge each juror for cause alleging that
the prospective jurors were not ""indifferent"".  Counsel wanted to ask
each prospective juror whether the knowledge that the accused had previously
been incarcerated at a hospital for the ""criminally insane"" would
prejudice them towards the accused.  In order to explain some of his conduct,
the accused needed to make his prior incarceration known during testimony at
trial.  The trial judge rejected the application for reasons not relevant to
our discussion here.  Rather, it is the procedure and principles set out by the
Court of Appeal that are pertinent, as they form the basis for much of what has
been said subsequently by Canadian courts.

 

                   The Court of Appeal
begins by setting out a number of principles governing trial by jury and
factors that need to be balanced when considering challenges for cause.  First,
every accused person is entitled to an impartial jury.  Secondly, a juror must
be presumed to perform his/her duties in accordance with the oath sworn. 
Finally, the trial judge has a ""wide discretion"" and must be in a
position to control the challenge procedure.

 

                   In the exercise of
such discretion as regards challenges for cause based on pre-trial publicity,
the Court states that, except in extreme cases, mere dissemination by the media
of the facts of the case is not normally sufficient to ground a challenge for
cause.

 

                   As far as procedure
is concerned, the Court of Appeal discusses a trial judge's ability to
""pre-screen"" prospective jurors for ""obvious partiality"". 
Importantly, it limits this threshold procedure to cases involving
noncontroversial situations of partiality.  Regarding the proper form of a
challenge for cause, the Court holds that counsel must communicate a reason to
the trial judge outside of the mere words of s. 567(1) (b) (now s. 638(1)(b)).  Without this, it would not be
possible for the trial judge to direct the trial of the truth of the
challenge.  If the reason offered appears ""far-fetched"", the trial
judge can require further elaboration.  If the trial judge is satisfied that
there is some ""foundation"" to the challenge, then the trial of the
truth proceeds.  The questioning of the prospective juror must be relevant. 
This is another reason why the trial judge must be given an adequate
explanation for the challenge outside of the mere words of the section. 
Questioning in this phase should not become a ""fishing expedition"".

 

                   Based upon its
comprehensive discussion, the Court of Appeal dismissed the accused's appeal,
holding that what counsel was attempting to do in that case came closer to
securing a favourable jury than an impartial one.  Further, prospective jurors'
reactions to various pieces of evidence that may be elicited at trial are not
the proper subject of the challenge for cause procedure.  Impartiality is a
state of mind to be tested at the time of the swearing in of each juror.

 

                   In dismissing the
accused's appeal and affirming the reasons of the Court of Appeal, this Court
simply stated at p. 267 that:

 

We
agree with the Court of Appeal that the way in which and the grounds on which
the trial judge exercised his discretion in respect of the attempt of counsel
for the accused to challenge for cause is not open to objection. . . . 

 

                   We
would add that in our opinion the procedure outlined by the Court of Appeal for
dealing with challenges for cause provides a useful guide for trial
judges called on to deal with such challenges.  [Emphasis added.]

 

                   This Court's
subsequent decision in Barrow, supra, concerned the examination
by the trial judge of the jury panel in the absence of the accused and his
counsel.  The accused argued that this conduct vitiated the subsequent trial. 
While the issue is not on all fours with the one facing the Court here, there
occurs within the majority reasons of Dickson C.J. an important discussion of Hubbert,
supra, and the challenge for cause procedure.

 

                   In Barrow, supra,
the Crown relied on the reasons of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Hubbert,
supra, as justification for the conduct of the trial judge.  Dickson
C.J., writing for the majority, rejected this argument on two grounds.  First,
the pre-screening procedure set out in Hubbert, supra, is done in
the presence of the accused.  Second, and more importantly for our purposes, at
pp. 709-10:

 

. .
. an initial question by the judge to the jury array is best seen as a summary
procedure to speed up the jury selection, done with the consent of the
parties.  This was the view of the majority of the Quebec Court of Appeal in
Guérin v. R.
[citation omitted].  Both Bisson J.A. (at p. 246) and Jacques J.A. (at
pp. 248-49) make the point that when counsel agree to initial questions by
the judge there is no violation of the Code procedure.

 

                   Within his
discussion of the Nova Scotia Juries Act, S.N.S. 1969, c. 12, applicable in
that case, and the respective competence of the provinces and Parliament to
legislate in this area, Dickson C.J. makes a number of strong statements
regarding challenges for cause on the ground of ""non-indifference"".  At
p. 714 he states that the trier of partiality is not the judge but two
potential or previously selected jurors.  Further:

 

Any
addition to this process from another source would upset the balance of the
carefully defined jury selection process.  This is especially the case of any
attempt to add to the powers of the judge. . . . The judge's role is to
supervise trials of partiality, not to decide them.

 

                   According to the
majority, error of this kind in the selection process is so severe that the
only remedy is a new trial.

 

                   The Ontario Court
of Appeal had a recent notable occasion, subsequent to Hubbert, supra,
to consider the proper use of the challenge for cause procedure, namely in R.
v. Zundel (No. 1) (1987), 31 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (leave to appeal to this
Court refused [1987] 1 S.C.R. xii).  The facts of this case being so notorious,
I will not summarize them here.  Suffice it to say that counsel for the accused
wished to challenge each prospective juror for cause based upon the massive
pre-trial publicity.  Instead of allowing the challenge for cause to proceed
the trial judge asked the jury array, among other things, whether they had
formed a preliminary opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused and
asked them to disqualify themselves on this basis.  

 

                   The Court of Appeal
held that the real question, in a case involving pre-trial publicity, was
whether it ""could potentially have the effect of destroying the
prospective juror's indifference between the Crown and the accused.""  The
Court noted that much of the trial judge's reluctance to allow the questioning
of jurors stemmed from the fact that the questions, in large measure, went to
the religious and political beliefs of the jurors.  However, instead of
rejecting the challenge, the trial judge, according to the Court, should have
required counsel for the accused to reword the questions.   The Court of Appeal
concluded in this fashion, at pp. 134-35:

 

                   There
is a denial of a fundamental right to a fair and proper trial where the accused
is not allowed to challenge any number of jurors for cause, when the grounds of
challenge are properly specified. . . . [C]ounsel was entitled to determine
whether any potential juror was, by reason of the pretrial publicity and the
notoriety of the appellant, sufficiently impartial. . . . 

 

A
trial judge cannot, in the exercise of a discretion which he undoubtedly
possesses in the area of admitting grounds of challenge for cause and settling
the questions, effectively curtail the statutory right to challenge for cause. 

 

                   The
warning later given by the trial judge, requesting that individual members of
the panel disqualify themselves under certain circumstances, was insufficient
to correct the erroneous denial of the statutory right of challenge for cause. 
The issue of impartiality or indifference is one that Parliament has entrusted
to the two triers, not to the conscience of the individual prospective juror.

 

                   The last case I
will discuss at any length is that of Guérin and
Pimparé,
supra, a case that
received favourable mention by this Court in Barrow, supra.  The
two accused in the case had allegedly committed a double murder that was the
subject of massive media speculation and community outrage.  Bisson J.A., now
Chief Justice, noted that ""this tragedy horrified the Montreal community,
and that, in large measure, the events, which were widely publicized by the
media, were . . . still fresh in the minds of a good number of the
citizens"" (at p. 241).  The trial judge refused the application of counsel
to challenge each prospective juror for cause on the basis of the pre-trial
publicity.  Instead, the trial judge, in essence, took over the procedure and
asked each juror questions suggested by counsel.  The trial judge then decided
whether the individual juror was or was not impartial.

 

                   All three members
of the Court of Appeal delivered reasons.  In discussing the Hubbert, supra,
pre-screening procedure, Bisson J.A. commented that such a procedure cannot
entail the judicial takeover of a process granted to two triers under the
Criminal Code . 
Further, the words used in Hubbert, supra, regarding
pre-screening by the trial judge, indicate that such a procedure is only
appropriate for ""obvious"" cases of partiality.  This power in the
trial judge does not extend his/her ability to decide questions of partiality. 
If the challenge for cause is baseless, the trial judge can reject it.  Bisson
J.A. further stated, at p. 246:

 

                   Certainly,
the practice whereby the judge may ask the prospective juror several
preliminary questions is commendable. However, it must not systematically
remove all possibility of challenge for cause.  [Emphasis added.]

 

                   He allowed the
appeal on the basis that there was a ""fundamental defect in the
constitution of the tribunal which must judge the crimes charged. ... ""

 

                   Jacques J.A. agreed
with Bisson J.A. but added some of his own thoughts regarding the
""Hubbert"" pre-screening procedure.  He made the point that this
procedure arose to meet obvious cases of partiality and thus must be viewed as
being based upon the ""tacit consent"" of both parties.

 

                   Rothman J.A., in
short concurring reasons, also held that the trial judge had erred by screening
the jurors himself and by apparently denying any further challenge on the basis
of the massive pre-trial publicity.

 

                   In rationalizing
these various judicial expressions, it is necessary to reflect on what was in
fact said by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Hubbert, supra. 
While certain broad statements in that case may warrant comment, the Court's
discussion of the pre-screening procedure and the proper course for a trial
judge to follow in an application for a challenge for cause due to alleged
partiality, in the main, cannot be challenged.  Generally, the Court correctly
states the law as it is understood in this country when dealing with an
application for a challenge for cause based upon partiality.  Certain comments
may, however, be appropriate in light of the coming into force of the
Charter .  While it is
no doubt true that trial judges have a wide discretion in these matters and
that jurors will usually behave in accordance with their oaths, these two
principles cannot supercede the right of every accused person to a fair trial,
which necessarily includes the empanelling of an impartial jury. (See The Law
Reform Commission of Canada, The Jury in Criminal Trials, Working Paper 27, 1980.)

 

                   This, however, does
not mean that an accused has the right to a favourable jury nor that the
selection procedure can be used to thwart the representativeness that is
essential to the proper functioning of a jury.  While it may be, in some
instances, that the peremptory challenges allocated to the accused and the
Crown, and the Crown's additional right to stand aside, will be used by the
parties to alter somewhat the degree to which the jury represents the
community, peremptory challenges are justified on a number of grounds.  The
accused may, for example, not have sufficient information to challenge for
cause a member of the panel he/she feels should be excluded.  Peremptory
challenges can also, in certain circumstances, produce a more representative
jury depending upon both the nature of the community and the accused. 
Challenges of this nature also serve to heighten an accused's perception that
he/she has had the benefit of a fairly selected tribunal.  

 

                   As to challenges
for cause, they are properly used to rid the jury of prospective members who
are not indifferent or who otherwise fall within s. 567  (now s. 638), of
the Code, but they stray into illegitimacy if used merely, without more, to
over- or under-represent a certain class in society or as a ""fishing
expedition"" in order to obtain personal information about the juror.  As
previously mentioned, information obtained on an ultimately unsuccessful
challenge for cause may, however, lead the challenger to exercise the right to
challenge peremptorily or to stand aside the particular juror.  If the
challenge process is used in a principled fashion, according to its underlying
rationales, possible inconvenience to potential jurors or the possibility of
slightly lengthening trials is not too great a price for society to pay in
ensuring that accused persons in this country have, and appear to have, a fair
trial before an impartial tribunal, in this case, the jury.

 

                   This being said,
some words of caution are in order as to the nature of the pre-screening that
can be legitimately engaged in by trial judges.  If one harkens back to the
actual words used by the Court of Appeal in Hubbert, supra, it
becomes clear, in my opinion, that the procedure envisioned is inoffensive and
falls outside of the warnings delivered in Barrow, supra, and Guérin
and Pimparé, supra, as evidenced by the following, at pp. 292-93:

 

                   Turning
to the practical consideration of the methods by which the process should be
carried out, we deal first with the kind of obvious partiality dealt
with in the English practice direction.  Some trial Judges make a practice of
saying to the jury panel, before the selection process begins, something of
this nature:

 

If
there is anyone on this panel who is closely connected with a party to this
case or with a witness who is to testify, will you please stand?

 

                                                                   .
. .

 

To
take obvious examples, if the juror is the uncle of the accused, or the wife of
a witness, or the brother of the investigating police officer, he ought not to
serve.

 

                   In
our view, the trial Judge on his own should excuse that prospective juror from
the case, without more ado. . . . We think the practice of excusing jurors
of obvious partiality is a desirable one in all cases.  [Emphasis added.]

 

                   I agree.  And, as
pointed out by the Ontario Court of Appeal, if the trial judge does not excuse
a juror at this stage, that juror is still subject to challenge or to a direction
to stand aside.  Nothing said by the Court of Appeal relates to cases of
disputed partiality.  The initial procedure outlined by the Court of Appeal
goes only to such clear-cut cases of partiality that, as said in Guérin and
Pimparé, supra, and Barrow, supra, the consent of
counsel is and can be presumed.  Once out of obvious situations of
non-indifference, as in Guérin and Pimparé, supra, and Barrow,
supra, the procedure takes on a different colour: consent can no longer
be presumed and the procedure must conform to that which is set out in the
Criminal Code .  There
is absolutely no room for a trial judge to increase further his/her powers and
take over the challenge process by deciding controversial questions of
partiality.  If there exist legitimate grounds for a challenge for cause,
outside of the obvious cases addressed by the Hubbert, supra,
procedure, it must proceed in accordance with the Code provisions --the threshold
pre-screening mechanism is a poor, and more importantly, an illegal substitute
in disputed areas of partiality.  (See Vidmar and Melnitzer, ""Juror
Prejudice: An Empirical Study of a Challenge for Cause"" (1984), 22
Osgoode Hall L.J.
487.)  After this initial, narrowly drawn procedure is complete, the process as
set out in the Criminal Code  must be adhered to.  I will refer again to the
clear words of Dickson C.J. in Barrow, supra, at p. 714, which,
though addressing a somewhat different question, are apposite here:

 

                   The Code sets out a detailed process for the
selection of an impartial jury.  It gives both parties substantial powers in
the process and sets up a mechanism to try the partiality of a potential juror
when challenged for cause.  The trier of partiality is not the judge but a
mini-jury of two potential or previously selected jurors. . . . Parliament has
decided that the issue of partiality is a question of fact that must be decided
by two of the jurors themselves, not by the judge. . . . [A]ny judge who
attempts to participate in such decisions usurps the function of the jurors. .
. . 

 

                   Perhaps more
pertinent to the issue here is the question of what degree of pre-trial
publicity or, more generally, non-indifference, is necessary to lead to the
right to challenge for cause and thus have the trial of the issue proceed before
the ""mini-jury"".  The example of pre-trial publicity arises on the
facts of this case and the existence of publicity prior to trial would appear
to be the most frequent cause for a challenge based upon non-indifference.

 

                   A number of factors
need to be addressed in answering this question.  To begin with, s. 567  (now s.
638) of the Criminal Code  places little, if any, burden on the
challenger.  On the other hand, a reasonable degree of control must be retained
by the trial judge and, thus, some burden placed upon the challenger to ensure
that the selection of the jury occurs in a manner that is in accordance with
the principles I have previously articulated and also to ensure that sufficient
information is imparted to the trial judge such that the trial of the truth of
the challenge is contained within permissible bounds.  Thus, while there must
be an ""air of reality"" to the application, it need not be an
""extreme"" case, as were, for example, the cases of Zundel, supra,
and Guérin and Pimparé, supra.  The Ontario Court of Appeal in Zundel,
supra, provided a useful guide in this regard, at p. 132:

 

The
real question is whether the particular publicity and notoriety of the accused
could potentially have the effect of destroying the prospective juror's
indifference between the Crown and the accused.

 

                   Postulating rigid
guidelines is obviously an impossible task.  Lawton J. in R.
v. Kray (1969), 53
Cr. App. R. 412, draws a valuable distinction, in pre-trial publicity cases,
between mere publication of the facts of a case and situations where the media
misrepresents the evidence, dredges up and widely publicizes discreditable incidents
from an accused's past or engages in speculation as to the accused's guilt or
innocence.  It may well be that the pre-trial publicity or other ground of
alleged partiality will, in itself, provide sufficient reasons for a challenge
for cause.  The threshold question is not whether the ground of alleged
partiality will create such partiality in a juror, but rather whether it could
create that partiality which would prevent a juror from being indifferent as to
the result.  In the end, there must exist a realistic potential for the
existence of partiality, on a ground sufficiently articulated in the
application, before the challenger should be allowed to proceed.

 

Application
to the Facts of the Case

 

                   Applying these
principles to the facts of this case, given the whole of the circumstances, the
procedure followed by the trial judge was correct.  It is unfortunate, however,
in my view, that the trial judge used the word ""extraordinary"" to
describe the challenge for cause procedure.  As I have hopefully made clear
throughout these reasons, the right to challenge for cause is an important one
designed to ensure a fair trial.  It is of great assistance in the selection of
a jury that can properly fulfill those duties accorded it.  Further, the
ability to challenge for cause rests upon a showing by the challenger of a
realistic potential for partiality.  The process is neither
""extraordinary"" nor ""exceptional"". 

 

                   Notwithstanding his
seeming misapprehension of the nature of the process, the trial judge was
correct, in my view, in deciding that there was nothing before him in the
present instance that satisfied the requirement set out above.  The pre-trial
publicity did not satisfy the query, ""whether the particular publicity and
notoriety of the accused could potentially have the effect of destroying the
prospective juror's indifference.""  Based on the information given to the
judge, there was no realistic potential for the existence of partiality on the
basis of pre-trial publicity.  The trial occurred a substantial period of time
after the publicity in question and, more importantly, it appears that the
media reports were concerned more with the search and subsequent discovery of
the remains of the victim and the victim's reputation than with the accused or
subsequent proceedings against him.  As Huband J.A. said at p. 149, the
pre-trial publicity here ""was not of the type to occasion partiality
towards an accused"".  In addition, Jewers J. did not close off the
challenge procedure at this point but rather invited continued challenges based
on more appropriate information.  Such information was not forthcoming despite
the representation by accused's counsel that he had material to substantiate
his allegations.

 

                   Having so
concluded, I am nonetheless of the view that the majority of the Court of
Appeal interpreted Hubbert, supra, too broadly.  I refer
particularly to the comments of Huband J.A., at p. 150, regarding the pre-screening
of prospective jurors for partiality undertaken by the trial judge.  This
initial process, in my view, only applies, as is evidenced by the words used in
Hubbert, supra, to consensual, uncontested matters of partiality
and not where the challenge for cause is grounded on some pertinent allegation
as in Barrow, supra, and Guérin and Pimparé, supra.

 

Disposition

 

                   As the challenge
for cause on the basis of the pre-trial publicity was groundless in this case,
I agree in the result with the majority of the Court of Appeal and I would
therefore dismiss the appeal.

 

//Stevenson
J.//

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by 

 

                   Stevenson
J. -- I have had the
advantage of reading the opinion of my colleague Justice L'Heureux-Dubé and
agree with her disposition of the appeal and her reasons for disposing of the
point raised in the dissent which gave rise to the appeal.

 

                   I prefer, however,
to restrict my concurrence to that point lest I be  thought to be passing upon
the discussion of the collateral questions, notably that of the
""representative"" nature of the jury.

 

                   The issue in the
appeal is the propriety of the response of the trial judge to a request by the
defence counsel that he be permitted to put some 11 questions to each juror by
way of a challenge for cause.  The dissenting judge, (1989), 58 Man. R. (2d)
145, described the main ground of appeal at p. 151, as being ""that the
trial judge usurped the function of triers of facts in dealing with challenges
for cause.""  In the course of his reasons he cast some doubt upon the
authority of R. v. Hubbert (1975), 29 C.C.C. (2d) 279.

 

                   I pause to note
that, had the trial judge purported to decide the question of whether a
challenge was proven as distinct from the question of whether it might be made,
""usurpation"" would be a proper characterization.

 

                   Hubbert, has been frequently cited and
applied, and, in my view, its authority remains undiminished.  Two propositions
may be drawn from it.  Firstly, some concerns about partiality may be addressed
by procedures short of a challenge for cause.  The trial judge's putting
general questions to the panel is one example.  Secondly, where counsel seeks
to invoke the right to challenge each juror the trial judge is to be satisfied
there is some foundation to the challenge.

 

                   This appeal
involves the second proposition and I agree with  L'Heureux-Dubé J. that in
this case the challenge for cause on the basis of pre-trial publicity was
groundless.  I add that defence counsel at trial expressed the view that the
questioning ""would give me some rational basis for exercising the
peremptory challenge"".  The latter is not a permissible ground for
challenging for cause.

 

                   I would, therefore,
dismiss the appeal.

 

                   Appeal dismissed.

on appeal from the court of appeal for british columbia








Criminal law — Controlled drugs and substances —
Forfeiture orders — Specific proportionality test provided for offence‑related
real property forfeiture orders — Relationship of test with general sentencing
principles — Marihuana grow operation located in house owned by accused —
Accused found guilty of producing and possessing marihuana for purpose of
trafficking — Conditional imprisonment sentence imposed and forfeiture of house
ordered — Forfeiture order upheld by Court of Appeal — Whether real property forfeiture orders should be considered together with terms of
imprisonment as a global punishment — Whether order justified — Controlled
Drugs and Substances Act, S.C. 1996, c. 19, s. 19.1(3) .

 

The accused were found guilty of producing marihuana as
well as possession of the drug for the purpose of trafficking, contrary to
ss. 5(2)  and 7(1)  of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act . They
owned the house where the drug was grown but resided elsewhere with their two
young children. Only their 18‑year‑old daughter was living in the
house. The trial judge observed that the accused had likely bought the house
for the sole purpose of growing marihuana. He imposed an 18‑month
conditional sentence and ordered forfeiture of the house. The Court of Appeal
upheld the order.

 

Held:  The
appeal should be dismissed.

 








Per McLachlin C.J.
and Binnie, Deschamps, Abella and Rothstein JJ.:  As indicated in R. v.
Craig, 2009 SCC 23, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 762, forfeiture orders for real
property made under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act  should be
approached independently of the broader sentencing inquiry.  Considering the
relevant facts of this case, particularly the purpose for which the house was
purchased, forfeiture of the property was not disproportionate in accordance
with the statute.  [2] [14]

 

Per LeBel J.: 
Subject to the reasons of LeBel J. in R. v. Craig, 2009 SCC 23, [2009] 1

disproportionate in this case. [16]

the purpose of trafficking, contrary to ss. 5(2)  and 7(1)  of the Controlled
Drugs and Substances Act .  These charges related to a marihuana grow
operation located in a three-level residence in Surrey, British Columbia. 

 

[4]    
The residence was registered in Mr. Nguyen’s name. 

 

[5]    
At the time of the offence, Mr. and Mrs. Nguyen resided with their two
younger children in a rental accommodation elsewhere.  Their eldest daughter,
then 18 years old, resided in the Surrey building.  After they were charged,
the rest of the family moved into the property.

 

[6]    
The police seized a “moderately‑sized but sophisticated grow
operation” containing 96 marihuana plants.  At the time of the search, it was
apparent that there had been a recent harvest due to the presence of empty
pots.  A new crop of marihuana had been prepared.

 








[7]    
Marihuana clones were found in the main floor kitchen refrigerator.  Two
of the three bedrooms on the upper floor were only used on a transitory basis. 
The exterior front door to the residence had a metal bracket and a barricade. 
The windows to the basement rooms containing marihuana plants were boarded up. 
Lighting, irrigation and ventilation systems had been installed in the
basement.  Air fresheners were installed on the main floor.  More generally,
the Nguyens had gone to significant lengths to conceal the nature of the
operation inside the property. 

 

[8]    
Mr. and Mrs. Nguyen were found guilty of both charges.  At the Supreme
Court of British Columbia, Josephson J. imposed an 18-month conditional
sentence, as well as ordering full forfeiture of the residence in which the
marihuana was produced.

 

[9]    
Neither of the Nguyens had a criminal record, nor did they have any
involvement in organized crime.  However, the trial judge found as aggravating
factors the sophistication and commercial nature of the operation, as well as
the likelihood that the house had been purchased for the sole purpose of
growing marihuana.

 

[10] Writing
for a unanimous court, Kirkpatrick J.A. applied Ryan J.A.’s approach outlined
in R. v. Craig, 2007 BCCA 234, 240 B.C.A.C. 77, described in greater
detail in the companion case Craig, and dismissed the appeal from
sentence.  She upheld the forfeiture order against the Nguyens’ property: 2007
BCCA 474, 246 B.C.A.C. 263.

 








[11] In my
view, the conclusion of the trial judge and of the Court of Appeal with respect
to full forfeiture should not be disturbed on these facts.  While the Nguyens’
grow operation was roughly comparable in size and sophistication to Ms.
Craig’s, at least two important factors distinguish this case and suggest that
forfeiture would not be disproportionate within the meaning of s. 19.1(3) . 

 

[12] Of
particular relevance, in my view, is Josephson J.’s observation that the
Nguyens bought the house for the sole purpose of growing marihuana.  This means
that the property was tainted from the outset by a criminal purpose. (See R.
v. Nguyen, 2006 BCSC 1846, [2006] B.C.J. No. 3202 (QL), at para. 14.) 

 

[13] In
addition, it is significant that the Nguyens resided elsewhere with their two
younger children, while their 18‑year‑old daughter lived in the
house.  As the trial judge observed, this fact suggests that the property’s
main function was as the site of a grow operation.  This too is relevant in
weighing the factors in s. 19.1(3) . 

 

[14] I am
therefore of the view that full forfeiture of the property was not
disproportionate in accordance with the statute.

 

[15] I
would dismiss the appeal.

 

The following are the reasons delivered by

 

[16] LeBel J. — Subject to my reasons in R.
v. Craig, 2009 SCC 23, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 762, I would dispose of the appeal

Present:  McLachlin C.J. and Fish, Abella, Rothstein, Cromwell,

on appeal from the court of appeal for manitoba

                    Criminal
law — Offences — Uttering threats — Elements of offence — Mens rea — Respondent
repeatedly telling ex‑girlfriend that he would kill her — Ex‑girlfriend
testifying that words uttered by accused did not intimidate her or cause her
fear as accused frequently talked in that manner — Whether trial judge erred in
law in determining that accused did not have requisite mens rea — Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46, s. 264.1(1) (a).

                    While
the accused was incarcerated, he had a telephone conversation with his ex‑girlfriend
during which he repeatedly told her that he would kill her upon his release if
she proceeded with her planned abortion of their child.  The accused was
charged with uttering threats.  At trial, the ex‑girlfriend testified
that the words uttered by the accused had not intimidated her or caused her
fear as the accused frequently talked in that manner.  The accused was
acquitted, the trial judge having a reasonable doubt whether the accused
intended his words to intimidate or be taken seriously.  The Court of Appeal
dismissed the Crown’s appeal. 

                    Held
(McLachlin C.J. and Abella and Rothstein JJ. dissenting):  The appeal
should be dismissed.

                    Per
Fish, Cromwell, Moldaver and Wagner JJ.:  It is an essential element of
the offence under s. 264.1(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  that
the accused intended his or her words to intimidate or to be taken seriously. 
The trial judge properly considered the words uttered in the context of the
evidence of the recipient of the threats and concluded that the evidence left
her with a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused had the requisite
intent.  There is no basis on which to conclude that the trial judge committed
any error of law in concluding as she did. 

                    Per
McLachlin C.J. and Abella and Rothstein JJ. (dissenting):  The trial
judge erred in making the perception of the recipient of the threat the
determinative factor in the assessment of the accused’s intent.  The nature of
the relationship between the accused and the recipient of a threat forms part
of the circumstances surrounding the offence.  However, whether the recipient
of a threat takes that threat seriously is not an element of the mens rea
of the accused.

                    The
judgment of Fish, Cromwell, Moldaver and Wagner JJ. was delivered by

I

[1]                             
Fish J. — This appeal from a judgment of the
Manitoba Court of Appeal comes to us as of right, pursuant to s. 693(1) (a)
of the Criminal Code . 

[2]                             
In virtue of that provision, the Attorney
General may appeal to this Court “on any question of law on which a judge of
the court of appeal dissents”.  Here, the question is whether the trial judge,
in acquitting the respondent Kelly Joseph O’Brien, erred in law as to the mens
rea of the offence with which he was charged.  I agree with the majority in
the Court of Appeal that she did not (2012 MBCA 6, 275 Man. R. (2d) 144).

[3]                             
I would therefore dismiss the appeal.

II

[4]                             
The respondent was charged with uttering a threat
to cause death or bodily harm to another person, contrary to s. 264.1(1) (a)
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 .   He was charged as well, in
a separate count, with threatening to damage that person’s property, contrary
to s. 264.1(1) (b).

[5]                             
In her brief reasons for judgment, delivered
orally, the trial judge held ― correctly, in my view ― that the actus
reus of the offence created by s. 264.1(1) (a) is “the actual
speaking or uttering of the threats of death or serious bodily harm”.  And,
again correctly, the trial judge held that the mens rea “is that the
words are meant [to convey] a threat.  In other words they are meant to
intimidate”.

[6]                             
This understanding of the essential elements of
a charge under s. 264.1(1) (a) conforms fully with the governing
decisions of this Court. 

[7]                             
Speaking for the Court in R. v. Clemente,
[1994] 2 S.C.R. 758, at p. 763, Cory J. stated:

                        Under
the present section the actus reus of the offence is the uttering of
threats of death or serious bodily harm. The mens rea is that the words
be spoken or written as a threat to cause death or serious bodily harm; that
is, they were meant to intimidate or to be taken seriously. [Emphasis deleted.]

See, to the same effect,
R. v. McCraw, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 72, at p. 82.

[8]                             
Moreover, before rendering judgment, the trial
judge took care to recess the proceedings for the express purpose of reviewing
the decision of this Court in Clemente.  In her reasons for judgment, as
I have already mentioned, she then proceeded to set out her understanding of
the law in full conformity with that decision.

III

[9]                             
At no point in her reasons did the trial judge
state, as the Crown contends, that she was acquitting the accused solely
because the recipient of the threats did not take them seriously. 

[10]                         
Rather, after setting out the law correctly, the
trial judge quite properly felt bound “to consider the words [uttered by Mr.
O’Brien] in the context of the evidence of [the person to whom they were
directed]”.  That evidence was relevant and therefore admissible for the purpose
of assessing the context in which the words were spoken. 

[11]                         
As Cory J. explained in Clemente, at p. 762:

                        .
. . the question of whether the accused had the intent to intimidate, or that
his words were meant to be taken seriously will, in the absence of any
explanation by the accused, usually be determined by the words used, the
context in which they were spoken, and the person to whom they were directed.

[12]                         
Manifestly, the trial judge asked herself the
right question.  Her answer was that the evidence left her with a reasonable
doubt whether Mr. O’Brien had acted with the requisite mens rea of the
offence with which he was charged.  And she entered an acquittal for that
reason.

IV

[13]                         
I agree with the Crown that it is not an
essential element of the offence under s. 264.1(1) (a) that the recipient
of the threats uttered by the accused feel intimidated by them or be shown to
have taken them seriously.  All that needs to be proven is that they were intended
by the accused to have that effect. 

[14]                         
Here, the trial judge was left with a reasonable
doubt in that regard.  Another judge might well have decided otherwise, but for
the reasons given, I am not persuaded that the trial judge committed the error
of law imputed to her by the Crown in concluding as she did.

[15]                         
I would therefore dismiss the appeal.

                    The reasons of
McLachlin C.J. and Abella and Rothstein JJ. were delivered by

[16]                         
Rothstein J. (dissenting) —  Kelly O’Brien was charged
with two counts of uttering threats contrary to s. 264.1(1)  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985,
c. C-46 , and two counts of breach of probation. 

[17]                         
The charges arose as a result of statements made
by Mr. O’Brien during a telephone call to his ex-girlfriend, Ms. W, while he
was incarcerated. Ms. W was pregnant with his child and was planning to have an
abortion because she suspected him of having had an affair with another woman.
Mr. O’Brien told Ms. W that he would kill her if she went through with the
abortion. 

[18]                         
The actus reus of uttering threats has
been conceded by Mr. O’Brien and is not in issue in this appeal. The only issue
before this Court is whether the trial judge properly assessed the mens rea of
the offence of uttering threats. 

[19]                         
At trial, Mr. O’Brien’s counsel submitted that
if “at the end of the day [the recipient of the threats] simply just didn’t
feel threatened . . . just didn’t feel scared it’s my respectful
submission that the offence at law has not been made out” (A.R., at p. 57). On
the other hand, the Crown submitted that “in law . . . it matters not
that the words were not taken seriously” (A.R., at p. 57). 

[20]                         
 The learned trial judge, referring to R. v.
Clemente, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 758, said in the course of argument that while
“the comments have to be uttered with the intent to intimidate or instill
. . . fear. . . . The case also indicates that such threats
have to be taken seriously” (A.R., at p. 59). The trial judge then retired to
review Clemente.

[21]                         
After a short adjournment, she returned to the
courtroom to deliver her oral reasons. In dealing with the mental element, the
trial judge stated that she had a reasonable doubt about “the mens rea
of the offence because of the evidence of Ms. [W], the fact she did not take
[the threats] seriously” (A.R., at p. 4).

[22]                         
Respectfully, the trial judge’s holding
misinterprets the mens rea of the offence of uttering threats as set out
in Clemente and R. v. McCraw, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 72. The Clemente
test asks the question: “Looked at objectively, in the context of all the
words written or spoken and having regard to the person to whom they were
directed, would the questioned words convey a threat of serious bodily harm to
a reasonable person?” (p. 762, quoting McCraw, at p. 83).

[23]                         
The trial judge did not ask herself what a
reasonable person would objectively perceive. Rather, she asked herself what
Ms. W perceived.  According to Clemente, the trial judge was
required to determine whether the reasonable person would consider that the
words were uttered as threats by “regard[ing] them objectively, and review[ing] them in light of the
circumstances in which they were uttered, the manner in which they were spoken,
and the person to whom they were addressed” (p. 763). Accordingly, the relationship between Mr.
O’Brien and Ms. W is not irrelevant. It forms part of the context and
circumstances surrounding the offence. However, whether
the recipient of a threat takes the threat seriously is not, in and of itself,
an element of the mens rea of the accused.

[24]                         
Here, the trial judge erred in making Ms. W’s
perception the determinative factor in assessing the accused’s intent to
instill fear in her and to intimidate her so that she would not have the
abortion. 

[25]                         
I am not unmindful of the “cautio[n] [to]
appellate judges not to dissect, parse, or microscopically examine the reasons
of a trial judge” (R. v. C.L.Y., 2008 SCC 2, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 5, at para.
11, referring to R. v. Morrissey (1995), 97 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (Ont. C.A.),
at pp. 203-5). However, in my respectful opinion, the error of law made by the
trial judge is self-evident.

[26]                         
I would accordingly allow the appeal, enter a
conviction and remit the matter to the Provincial Court of Manitoba for
sentencing.

on appeal from the court of appeal for quebec

                    Criminal law — Forfeiture
orders — Accused who had previously been convicted for multiple alcohol‑related
driving offences and breaches of probation orders and undertakings pleading guilty
to the charge of driving a motor vehicle while impaired by drugs or alcohol — Crown
requesting order of forfeiture of motor vehicle — Whether trial judge erred in
refusing to issue order.

Held:  The appeal
should be allowed and the forfeiture order granted.

                    In applying s. 490.41(3)  of
the Criminal Code , the trial judge held that he was bound to consider
the objectives and principles of sentencing set out in s. 718  and
following of the Code.  This error is fatal to his conclusion.  The respondent
failed to satisfy this Court that the impact of forfeiture would be
“disproportionate” within the meaning of s. 490.41(3) .  The order of
forfeiture sought by the Crown should therefore be granted.

                    The judgment of the Court was
delivered by

[1]                             
Fish J. — Alphide Manning,
the respondent on this appeal, pleaded guilty at trial to impaired driving and
the Crown, upon his conviction, sought forfeiture of the truck driven by Mr.
Manning at the time of his arrest.  

[2]                             
The trial judge declined to grant the order of
forfeiture requested by the Crown.

[3]                             
Our sole concern here is with s. 490.41(3)  of
the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , which, in its relevant part,
reads as follows:

                                     .
. . if a court is satisfied that the impact of an order of forfeiture made
under subsection 490.1(1) or 490.2(2) would be disproportionate to the nature
and gravity of the offence, the circumstances surrounding the commission of the
offence and the criminal record, if any, of the person charged with or
convicted of the offence, as the case may be, it may decide not to order the
forfeiture of the property or part of the property and may revoke any restraint
order made in respect of that property or part.

[4]                             
In applying that provision here, the trial judge
held that he was bound to consider the objectives and principles of sentencing
set out in s. 718 and following of the Criminal Code .  

[5]                             
We agree with the Quebec Court of Appeal (2011
QCCA 900 (CanLII)) that the trial judge erred in this regard: see R. v.
Craig, 2009 SCC 23, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 762, at para.  13. 

[6]                             
Unlike the Court of Appeal, however, and with
the greatest of respect, we believe that the trial judge’s error is fatal to
his conclusion.  

[7]                             
Moreover, on the record as we have it, we are
not satisfied that the impact of the order of forfeiture sought by the Crown
was “disproportionate”, within the meaning of s. 490.41(3)  of the Criminal
Code .  In concluding otherwise, the trial judge erroneously emphasized Mr.
Manning’s personal circumstances and failed to give appropriate weight, as
required by s. 490.41(3) , to Mr. Manning’s criminal record, including five convictions
for alcohol-related driving offences and three for breaches of probation
orders or undertakings. 

[8]                             
Accordingly, we would allow the appeal and grant
the order of forfeiture sought by the Crown.

                    Appeal allowed.

on appeal from the court of appeal for quebec

                    Criminal
law — Appeals — Application for extension of time — Appellant pleading guilty
to 14 charges between 1996 and 2005 — Appellant found unfit to stand trial in
2011 for reason of intellectual disability — Appellant subsequently seeking to
have convictions entered between 1996 and 2005 set aside — Majority of Court of
Appeal dismissing application for extension of time to appeal convictions — Court
of Appeal not erring in dismissing application for extension of time.

                    APPEAL
from a judgment of the Quebec Court of Appeal (Chamberland, Rochette and
Dalphond JJ.A.), 2012 QCCA 635, [2012] J.Q. no 3071 (QL), SOQUIJ

Desrosiers and Lida Sara Nouraie, for
the appellant.

                    Geneviève
Dagenais and Christian Jarry, for
the respondent.

                    The
following is the judgment delivered orally by

[1]                             
LeBel J. — Speaking
for a majority of the Court, I am of the opinion that the Court of Appeal of
Quebec did not err when, for the reasons given by Chamberland J.A., it
dismissed the appellant’s application for an extension of time, and for those
reasons, the appeal is dismissed.

[2]                             
Justice Cromwell, dissenting, essentially for the reasons given by
Dalphond J.A. in dissent in the Court of Appeal, would have allowed the appeal,
granted the extension of time and returned the matter to the Court of Appeal.

                    Judgment accordingly.

on appeal from the court of appeal for alberta 

                    Criminal
law — Defences — Provocation — Whether objective and subjective elements of
provocation established, lending an air of reality to this defence — Whether
victim’s provoking comments were sudden, in the sense that accused was caught
unprepared and surprised by them — Whether defence of provocation should have
been submitted to jury — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46, s. 
232 . 

                    In
2006, K’s lifeless body was discovered.  He had been shot twice.  Days later, P
was arrested.  He confessed to killing K.  According to P, K had been extorting
money from him for 18 months by threatening to reveal details about his
offshore investments to the Canada Revenue Agency, and by threatening to harm
his mother if he chose to stop paying or went to the police.  P decided that he
had had enough.  He went to K’s home to end the extortion and threats.  He
brought along a loaded handgun in order to intimidate K but did not immediately
take out his gun.  Rather, he attempted to get K to agree to put an end to the
extortion.  K responded that he would continue the extortion and that he had
“great fucking insurance”, a comment that P took as an implied threat against
his mother.  At this point, P said he “snapped”.  He retrieved his gun and shot
K in the back and then in the head.

                    P
was charged with second degree murder.  At the trial by jury, P admitted to
killing K but argued that the defence of provocation applied.  Finding that
there was some evidence on the objective and subjective elements of the defence
of provocation, the trial judge left the defence with the jury.  The jury
rejected the defence, and found P guilty of second degree murder.  He appealed
his conviction, arguing inter alia that the trial judge erred in her
instructions to the jury on provocation.  The majority of the Court of Appeal
dismissed the appeal, holding that the defence of provocation was properly left
with the jury and that there were no errors in the instructions to the jury. 

                    Held: 
The appeal should be dismissed.

                    Per
McLachlin C.J. and Abella, Rothstein, Cromwell, Moldaver and Wagner JJ.: 
On the evidence in this case, there was no air of reality to the defence
of provocation and the defence should not have been left to the jury.  The
conviction for second degree murder, however, is affirmed.

                    Where
the evidence requires the drawing of inferences in order to establish the
objective or subjective elements of the defence of provocation, the trial judge
may engage in a limited weighing to determine whether the elements of the
defence can reasonably be inferred from the evidence.  For the purposes of the
application of the air of reality test, we must assume that the version of
events described in an accused’s confession is true.  That said, an air of
reality cannot spring from bare, unsupported assertions by the accused. 
Defences supported only by bald assertions that cannot reasonably be borne out
by the evidence, viewed in its totality, should be kept from the jury.

                    K’s
threat against the safety of P’s mother and the history of the relations
between K and P, provide a minimal evidential foundation for the objective
element of the defence.  However there was no air of reality to the subjective
element of the defence of provocation.  That element includes a requirement of
“suddenness” which applies to both the act of provocation and the accused’s
reaction to it.  The trial judge committed an error of law by only considering
whether there was evidence to support the contention that P had killed K before
there was time for his passion to cool.  She did not examine whether the record
could support a finding that K’s provoking comments were sudden, in the sense
that P was subjectively caught unprepared and surprised by them.

                    The
record cannot reasonably support an inference that P was caught unprepared by K’s
statements as K had made similar statements repeatedly in the past.  Viewed in
its totality, the evidence suggests that before setting out to visit K, P
contemplated the possibility that K would persist with his extortion and
threats, and that in that case, he would need to kill K to end them.  A
contention that P was caught unprepared is outside the range of reasonable
inferences that can be drawn from this evidence.  It is supported by little
more than P’s bald assertions that he “snapped” and “everything was just
automatic”.  

                    Per
Fish J.:  The trial judge did not err in leaving to the jury the defence
of provocation, nor did she commit a reviewable error in instructing the jury
as she did.

                    Where
there is direct evidence as to all elements of a defence, the trial judge must
put the defence to the jury.  Whether the evidence is true, or at least raises
a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, is a matter ultimately
reserved to the jury.  In this case, the accused’s evidence at trial
constitutes direct evidence and relates the facts upon which his defence of
provocation rests.  Accordingly, the appellant discharged his evidentiary
burden with respect to both the objective and subjective components of his
defence of provocation.  The mere fact that the deceased had made similar
threats in the past does not mean that the accused would have anticipated, or
been prepared for, subsequent threats of the same sort.  A reiterated threat or
insult can cause a previously unprovoked person to “snap”.  Here, the alleged
provocative act was not the deceased’s failure to end the extortion; rather, it
was his sudden utterance — “I got great fucking insurance” — which P understood
as a threat to his mother’s life.  P’s detailed evidence of the circumstances
surrounding the alleged provocation can hardly be equated with a “bare
assertion” that he was provoked.  The passages in P’s confession identified by
the Chief Justice as supporting a loss of self‑control constitute direct
evidence of the suddenness of the provocation and must be taken as true. 
Whether those passages are inconsistent with other evidence, however, is a
determination that must properly be left to the jury.  In the result, the
appeal fails for the reasons of the majority in the Court of Appeal.

                    The judgment of McLachlin
C.J. and Abella, Rothstein, Cromwell, Moldaver and Wagner JJ. was delivered by

                    The Chief Justice — 

I.    Background

[1]                             
On November 10, 2006, Brian Kullman’s body was
discovered in the Elbow Falls area southwest of Calgary, Alberta.  He had been
shot twice — once in the back, and once in the head. 

[2]                             
Five days later, the appellant, Bill Pappas, was
arrested as he was about to board a plane for London, England.  The police
interrogated him and he confessed to killing Kullman.  

[3]                             
Pappas explained to the police his version of
the events leading to Kullman’s death.  Pappas contended that Kullman had been
extorting money from him for approximately 18 months by threatening to reveal
details about his offshore investments to the Canada Revenue Agency, and by
threatening to harm his mother if he chose to stop paying or went to the
police. According to Pappas, two of Kullman’s associates had visited his mother
as a threatening gesture, and had thereafter told him, “You say no to Brian —
you say no to Brian and next time it won’t be a social visit”: A.R., vol. II,
at p. 239.  

[4]                             
Pappas, as he put it, decided that he had had
enough.  He loaded his 9 millimetre handgun with four hollow point bullets and
went to Kullman’s condominium.  The ostensible purpose of the visit was to
store a bicycle in Kullman’s basement.  The real purpose was to end the
extortion and threats.  Pappas told the police that he brought the gun along
only to intimidate Kullman.  But he also explained that he chose this kind of
bullet because it was particularly lethal.  

[5]                             
During his visit to the condominium, Pappas
raised the subject of extortion several times with Kullman, attempting to get
him to agree to put an end to it.  He did not immediately take out his gun, but
instead kept it concealed on his hip. On the way to the basement where the bike
would be stored, Pappas tried one more appeal, saying, “Brian, just please —
let’s just end this”.  In response, Kullman said, “Buddy, why the fuck should
I? You’re the best cash out I have and I got great fucking insurance”:  A.R.,
vol. II, at p. 241.

[6]                             
Pappas took the reference to “insurance” as an
implied threat against his mother.  At this point, he said, he just “snapped”,
his “mind shut down and everything was just automatic”:  A.R., vol. III, at p.
64, and vol. II, at p. 304.  He retrieved the gun, cocked the hammer, and shot
Kullman in the back at close range.  Kullman screamed and began to fall, and
Pappas fired again.  Finally, as the victim lay on the floor in distress,
Pappas moved the handgun to within 7 or 8 inches of Kullman’s head and shot him
in the left side of his head. 

[7]                             
Pappas pulled Kullman’s body up the stairs and
loaded it in Kullman’s car.  After returning to the basement and setting a fire
to cover his tracks, he drove to Elbow Falls where he rolled the body down an
embankment.  Several days later, he also disposed of Kullman’s credit card and
of bloodstained clothes in the garbage cans behind a convenience store and a
gas station.

[8]                             
In his confession, Pappas admitted that he had
forged a cheque from Kullman to himself for $2,500 and deposited it into his
bank account, and that he had used Kullman’s credit card.

[9]                             
Throughout, Pappas insisted that he had murdered
Kullman to save his mother from harm. 

[10]                         
Pappas was charged with second degree murder for
the killing of Kullman.

II.  The Trial and Appeal

[11]                         
At the trial by jury, Pappas’ confession was
entered by the Crown as evidence.  Pappas did not testify, but relied on his
confession as evidence on the issue of provocation.  Maintaining that he
“snapped” and killed Kullman following the implied threat to harm his mother,
he argued that the defence of provocation applied to reduce the verdict from
murder to manslaughter.

[12]                         
The trial judge initially took the view that the
provocation defence lacked an air of reality.  However, after hearing defence
submissions on the matter, she concluded: 

I am satisfied that if the
jury were to believe the evidence of Mr. Pappas on this issue of provocation
properly, there is some evidence upon which a reasonable jury properly
instructed could find there has been provocation. I acknowledge that the
evidence on the objective and subjective test is not strong. But it is there. 
[A.R., vol. I, at p. 5]

 

[13]                         
The jury rejected the defence of provocation,
and found Pappas guilty of second degree murder. 

[14]                         
Pappas appealed his conviction, arguing inter
alia that the trial judge’s instructions to the jury on provocation
contained several errors.  The Crown argued that the instructions were
error-free.  In addition, the Crown contended that there was no air of reality
to the defence and that it never should have been left with the jury.

[15]                         
The majority of the Court of Appeal, per
O’Brien and Rowbotham JJ.A., dismissed the appeal.  It held that the defence of
provocation was properly left with the jury and that there were no errors in
the instructions to the jury: 2012 ABCA 221, 533 A.R. 294.

[16]                         
Berger J.A., dissenting, agreed with the
majority that the defence was properly left with the jury but found several
errors in the instructions to the jury.

[17]                         
Mr. Pappas now appeals to this Court.  Before
us, four issues arise:

(1) Was the defence
of provocation properly left to the jury? (The Crown contends it was not,
making it unnecessary for this Court to consider whether the charge on the
defence was in error.)

(2) Did the trial
judge fail to adequately instruct the jury that the post-offence conduct had no
bearing on the issue of provocation?

(3) Did the trial
judge misstate the accused’s motive?

(4) Did the trial judge err by stating the suddenness instruction
disjunctively, requiring rejection of the defence if either the extortion or
the threat was not sudden?

[18]                         
For the reasons that follow, I would accept the
Crown’s argument that there was no air of reality to the defence of
provocation.  This makes it unnecessary for me to consider the other issues
raised by the appellant.

III.  Discussion

[19]                         
For ease of reference, I set out s. 232  of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 :

232. (1) Culpable homicide that otherwise would be murder may be reduced
to manslaughter if the person who committed it did so in the heat of passion
caused by sudden provocation.

 

(2)
A wrongful act or an insult that is of such a nature as to be sufficient to
deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control is provocation for the
purposes of this section if the accused acted on it on the sudden and before
there was time for his passion to cool.

 

(3)
For the purposes of this section, the questions

 

(a)
whether a particular wrongful act or insult amounted to provocation, and

     

(b)
whether the accused was deprived of the power of self-control by the
provocation that he alleges he received, 

 

are
questions of fact, but no one shall be deemed to have given provocation to
another by doing anything that he had a legal right to do, or by doing anything
that the accused incited him to do in order to provide the accused with an
excuse for causing death or bodily harm to any human being.

 

(4)
Culpable homicide that otherwise would be murder is not necessarily
manslaughter by reason only that it was committed by a person who was being
arrested illegally, but the fact that the illegality of the arrest was known to
the accused may be evidence of provocation for the purpose of this section.

Was the Defence of Provocation
Properly Left to the Jury?

[20]                         
The Crown contends that on the evidence in this
case, there was no air of reality to the defence of provocation.  I agree.  I
will first discuss the air of reality test, and then the objective and
subjective elements of the defence of provocation.

(1) The Air of Reality Test

[21]                         
As discussed in the companion case R. v.
Cairney, 2013 SCC 55, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 420, before leaving the defence to the jury, the trial judge must find
that there is an air of reality on both the objective and subjective elements
of the defence.  The question is whether a properly instructed jury acting
reasonably could be left in a state of reasonable doubt as to whether the
accused is guilty of murder, on the basis of the defence of provocation.  There
must be an evidential foundation for both the objective and subjective elements
of the defence, which s. 232(3)  of the Criminal Code  states are
questions of fact.

[22]                         
The air of reality test requires courts to tread
a fine line: it requires more than “some” or “any” evidence of the elements of
a defence, yet it does not go so far as to allow a weighing of the substantive
merits of a defence: R. v. Mayuran, 2012 SCC 31, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 162, at
para. 21.  A trial judge applying the air of reality test cannot consider
issues of credibility and reliability, weigh evidence substantively, make
findings of fact, or draw determinate factual inferences:  R. v. Cinous,
2002 SCC 29, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 87; R. v. Fontaine, 2004 SCC
27, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 702, at para. 12.  However, where appropriate, the trial
judge can engage in a “limited weighing” of the evidence, similar to that
conducted by a preliminary inquiry judge when deciding whether to commit an
accused to trial: see R. v. Arcuri, 2001 SCC 54, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 828,
cited by McLachlin C.J. and Bastarache J. in Cinous, at para. 91. 

[23]                         
The ability of the trial judge to engage in
“limited weighing” depends on the type of evidence on the record.  “If there is
direct evidence as to every element of the defence, whether or not it is
adduced by the accused, the trial judge must put the defence to the jury”: Cinous,
at para. 88.  The trial judge may not engage in any weighing of direct
evidence, since this would require a consideration of the inherent reliability
of the evidence. 

[24]                         
“Direct evidence is evidence which, if believed,
resolves a matter in issue”: Cinous, at para. 88, citing D. Watt, Watt’s
Manual of Criminal Evidence (2001), at § 8.0.  However, “the mere
assertion by the accused of the elements of a defence does not constitute
direct evidence, and will not be sufficient to put the defence before a jury”: Cinous,
at para. 88.  An air of reality “cannot spring from what amounts to little more
than a bare, unsupported assertion by the accused”, which is otherwise
inconsistent with the totality of the accused’s own evidence: R. v. Park,
[1995] 2 S.C.R. 836, at para. 35, per L’Heureux-Dubé J. For example, in R.
v. Gauthier, 2013 SCC 32, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 403, this Court, per Wagner J., suggested that a single
statement made by an accused that is otherwise inconsistent with the accused’s
“principal narrative” is insufficient to give an air of reality to a defence:
paras. 60-61.

[25]                         
Where the evidence instead requires the drawing
of inferences in order to establish the elements of a defence, the trial judge
may engage in a limited weighing to determine whether the elements of the
defence can reasonably be inferred from the evidence.  “The judge does not draw
determinate factual inferences, but rather comes to a conclusion about the
field of factual inferences that could reasonably be drawn from the evidence”: Cinous,
at para. 91.  In conducting this limited weighing, the trial judge must examine
the totality of the evidence: Cinous, at para. 53; Park, at para.
13, per L’Heureux-Dubé J. 

[26]                         
As discussed in Cairney, in cases where
there is a real doubt as to whether the air of reality test is met, the defence
of provocation should be left to the jury.  However, this principle does not
exempt the trial judge from engaging in a limited weighing of the evidence,
where appropriate.  The fact remains that the trial judge exercises a
gatekeeper role in keeping from the jury defences that have no evidential
foundation.  Defences supported only by bald assertions that cannot reasonably
be borne out by the evidence, viewed in its totality, should be kept from the
jury.  

[27]                         
In the present appeal, Pappas relies upon his
confession as providing the grounds for the defence of provocation.  For the
purposes of the application of the air of reality test, we must assume that the
version of events described in that confession is true: Cinous, at
paras. 53 and 119.  The question is whether a properly instructed jury acting
reasonably could be left in a state of reasonable doubt as to the presence of
each of the elements of the defence of provocation.  There must be an
evidential foundation for both the objective and subjective elements of the
defence.  I will now examine each of these in turn.

(2) The Objective Element

[28]                         
The objective element asks whether there was a
wrongful act or insult by the deceased, sufficient to deprive an ordinary
person of the power of self-control.  Pappas argues that his confession
provides evidence of a wrongful act or insult, in the form of Kullman’s
statement that he had “great fucking insurance”.  Pappas’ confession describes
a sequence of events in which he had been consistently extorted for an 18-month
period and in which his mother had been the target of threats.  He contends
that Kullman’s reference to insurance caused him to finally snap. 

[29]                         
Unlike the companion case Cairney, this
appeal does not raise the issue of self-induced provocation.  Pappas did not
initiate an aggressive confrontation.  He did not confront Kullman at gunpoint;
his weapon remained concealed on him until the moment when he was allegedly
provoked.  Nor did he approach Kullman in an otherwise aggressive manner that
could predictably have induced threatening behaviour.  Rather, Pappas contends
that he tried to reason with Kullman, by asking him if the extortion could
cease.

[30]                         
The relevant question is thus whether an
ordinary person, placed in Pappas’ circumstances, would have been deprived of
self-control upon being told, “You’re the best cash out I have and I got great
fucking insurance”.

[31]                         
On the one hand, the ordinary person standard
must be contextualized to take into account the history of the relations
between Pappas and Kullman.  Pappas had been the target of ongoing extortion
and the safety of his mother had repeatedly been threatened. 

[32]                         
On the other hand, the ordinary person standard
seeks to ensure that only “behaviour which comports with contemporary society’s
norms and values will attract the law’s compassion”:  R. v. Tran, 2010
SCC 58, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 350, at para. 30.  The particular circumstances in
which the accused finds himself are relevant in determining the appropriate
standard of human behaviour against which to measure the accused’s conduct: Tran,
at para. 34.  Pappas had engaged in tax evasion that Kullman was threatening to
reveal to the Canada Revenue Agency.  He did not go to the police with respect
to Kullman’s extortion or threats.  Rather, he armed himself and attempted to dissuade
Kullman in person.  Arguably, this behaviour runs contrary to the ordinary
person standard.

[33]                         
Nevertheless, as discussed in the companion case
Cairney, what would suffice to cause an ordinary person to lose
self-control is a question of degree that the jury is well placed to decide,
and one which, in cases of doubt, should be left to the jury.  The nature of
Kullman’s comments — a perceived threat against the safety of Pappas’ mother —
and the history of the relations between Kullman and Pappas, provide a minimal
evidential foundation for the objective element of the defence.

(3) The Subjective Element

[34]                         
In my view, there was no air of reality to the
subjective element of the defence of provocation.  The subjective element is
two-fold: “. . . (1) the accused must have acted in response to the
provocation; and (2) on the sudden before there was time for his or her passion
to cool”:  Tran, at para. 36.  

[35]                         
Of particular relevance to this appeal is the
requirement of “suddenness”.  The defence of provocation does not apply to
killings that are purely the result of vengeance or of anger, without any
attendant loss of self-control:  Tran, at para. 38; R. v. Parent,
2001 SCC 30, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 761, at para. 10.  To determine whether there was
an actual loss of self-control, the common law has long asked whether the
accused acted “on the sudden”.  The requirement of suddenness has two
dimensions: (i) the wrongful act or insult must be sudden, in that the accused
is subjectively unprepared for it and is caught by surprise, and (ii) the
accused must kill “on the sudden”, before there is time for his passion to cool:
Tran, at para. 38; R. v. Tripodi, [1955] S.C.R. 438, at p. 443.

[36]                         
In my view, the trial judge committed an error of law by only
considering one of the two dimensions of “suddenness”.  She considered whether
there was evidence to support the contention that Pappas had killed Kullman
suddenly, before there was time for his passion to cool.  Indeed, the trial
judge reasoned that there was an air of reality to the subjective element on
the following basis:

Mr. Pappas did say that it was the
word “insurance” that set him off, and he reacted immediately to that.  It is not up to me to weigh the sufficiency of that evidence.  I
am satisfied that there is an air of reality to the defence.  [Emphasis added;
A.R., vol. I, at p. 5.]

However, she did not examine
whether the record could support a finding that Kullman’s provoking comments
were sudden, in the sense that Pappas was subjectively caught unprepared and
surprised by them.  This is an error of law, as “suddenness applies to
both the act of provocation and the accused’s reaction to it”: Tran, at
para. 38.  

[37]                         
The record cannot reasonably support an inference that Pappas was
caught unprepared by Kullman’s statement that he would continue the extortion
and that he had “great fucking insurance”.  Kullman had made similar statements
repeatedly in the past.  Viewed in its totality, the evidence suggests that
before setting out to visit Kullman, Pappas contemplated the possibility that
Kullman would persist with his extortion and threats, and that, in that case,
he would need to kill Kullman to end them.

[38]                         
The principal narrative of Pappas’ confession is that he had
resolved to put an end to the extortion and to the threats against his mother,
through whatever means necessary.  He brought a gun loaded with hollow point
bullets to his encounter with Kullman.  When asked why he chose these bullets,
he explained:

If you want to stop someone you use a
hollow point. You don’t use a regular ball round ‘cause that goes through them.
It doesn’t do any kind of damage. . . . It wasn’t supposed to be like that but
it kept building up. So, I bought them.  [A.R., vol. II, at p. 262]

[39]                         
 At several points in his confession, Pappas referenced his
decision to do whatever was necessary to end the extortion and the threats to
his mother.  He described that he felt that the threats left him with little
choice other than to confront Kullman:

You can’t imagine what it feels like
being put in [a] corner and then having to choose.  I didn’t wanna hurt him. I
didn’t care about me but it was my mom.  What was I supposed to? [sic]
He gave me no choice when he sent his friends — when he sent his friends
there.  He gave me no choice after that.  I started — I made — I made my
decision.  [A.R., vol. II, at p. 255]

He described how the ongoing extortion and threats
led him to make the “choice”, and how “[a]fter 18 months [of extortion] it
became very simple” — “[i]t was either [Kullman] or my mom”: A.R., vol. II, at
p. 259-61.  He went on to explain how, when he was standing outside the door to
Kullman’s condominium, he flashed back to the moment when Kullman’s associates
visited his mother.  He said, “So, as soon as that image crossed my mind that’s
it, ‘Gun’s staying with me’. . . . [Kullman] made his choice, I made mine right
there”: A.R., vol. II, at p. 294.  He described in detail how Kullman’s
repeated refusals to put an end to the extortion gradually made it clear he
would have to resort to using the gun he had brought:

We just started talking about things and I was
trying to tell him — I was trying to literally put my foot down right there,
trying to draw the line right there. . . . And, ah, he’s going, “Well, like I
say, you know, I mean I’ve got really good insurance”, you know? “And I’ve got
a good pay day coming up”, you know? . . . or so and he had good insurance. And
it just, you know, I’m trying to talk him out of it or so. It’s like I’m trying
to, you know, “Don’t go there, Brian.  Come on, man. Don’t go there”, because I
had something here on my hip . . . and I’m trying to do everything I can to
keep — to steer Brian away from that . . . .

 

. . .

 

I mean literally every time he would open his
goddamned mouth he would take one step closer to making me do what I had to do
and I didn’t want to go there.  [Emphasis added; A.R., vol. II, at pp. 299
and 302.]

[40]                         
The only passages in Pappas’ confession that
support a loss of self-control are the ones in which he describes his reaction
upon hearing Kullman once again make reference to the fact that he had
“insurance”:

It — it was just the way he said it. It
was just the way he said the word “insurance”. I knew what that meant. . . .
[A]fter that it was just my mind shut down and everything was just automatic. I
drew my gun, I chambered a round, I fired.  [A.R., vol. II, at p. 303]

At this point, Pappas said that he
“snapped”.  

[41]                         
 The contention that Pappas was caught
unprepared by Kullman’s comments is outside the range of reasonable inferences
that can be drawn from this evidence.  It is supported by little more than
Pappas’ bald assertions that he “snapped” and “everything was just automatic”.  Viewed in its totality, the evidence suggests that Pappas’ mind
was prepared for the possibility that Kullman might reject his pleas to end the
extortion, “making [him] do what [he] had to do”.  His narrative, viewed as a
whole, describes a progressive building up of the resolve to kill Kullman. 
Accepting Pappas’ evidence that he “snapped” as true, this was not the result
of a sudden insult striking an unprepared mind.  It was simply the final stage
of doing what he had come to do — killing Kullman if that was necessary to stop
the extortion and threats.

[42]                         
For these reasons, I conclude that there was no
air of reality to the subjective element of the defence of provocation on the
evidence.  The defence should not have been left to the jury.  Any errors in
the trial judge’s instructions to the jury regarding provocation were thus
irrelevant, and I need not examine the appellant’s other grounds of appeal.

IV.  Conclusion

[43]                         
I would dismiss the appeal and affirm the
conviction for second degree murder.

                    The following are the reasons
delivered by

                    Fish J. — 

I

[44]                         
Like the Chief Justice, but for different
reasons, I would dismiss this appeal and affirm the appellant’s conviction at
trial. 

[45]                         
Unlike the Chief Justice, however, and with the
greatest of respect, I agree with the Court of Appeal’s unanimous conclusion
that the trial judge did not err in leaving to the jury the appellant’s defence
of provocation (2012 ABCA 221, 533 A.R. 294).  

[46]                         
The Court of Appeal divided only as to the
adequacy of the trial judge’s charge to the jury.  In this regard, I agree with
the majority that the trial judge committed no reviewable error in instructing
the jury as she did.

[47]                         
In the result, the appeal fails.

II

[48]                         
There is no dispute that trial judges must leave
for the jury’s consideration every defence available on the record, subject
only to exceptional circumstances which have no application here.  To do
otherwise is to usurp the function of the jury and to deprive the accused of an
enshrined right under our system of justice.  

[49]                         
This is not new law.  In Henderson v. The
King, [1948] S.C.R. 226, for example, Kellock J. recognized that “[i]t is a
paramount principle of law that when a defence, however weak it may be, is
raised by a person charged, it should be fairly put before the jury” (p. 241;
see also Taschereau J., at p. 237).   

[50]                         
For some offences, the accused may choose trial
by jury; for others, as in this case, trial by jury is mandatory.  In either
instance, absent a directed verdict of acquittal, the determination of guilt or
innocence falls exclusively within the province of the jury.  That bedrock
principle is violated whenever a trial judge withholds from the jury a defence
that it is entitled — indeed, required by law — to consider. 

[51]                         
This case hardly invites concern over the
submission of weak defences to juries.  On the contrary, it illustrates why our
system of justice supposes that juries, properly instructed by judges, can be
trusted to reject defences that do not raise in their minds a reasonable doubt
as to the guilt of the accused.  That is what happened here.  The trial judge
felt bound to put to the jury the appellant’s defence of provocation — though
she found, understandably, that the evidence in support of the defence was “not
strong”.  And the jury, properly instructed and acting reasonably, rejected the
defence. 

[52]                         
In determining whether a defence must be
submitted to the jury, trial judges must take care not to infuse what has come
to be known as the “air of reality” test with any significance beyond the
governing standard that has prevailed for centuries.  That standard, though not
always formulated in identical terms, has never varied in substance:  A defence
must be put to the jury if there is any evidence upon which a properly
instructed jury, acting reasonably, could be left with a reasonable doubt as to
the guilt of the accused.  

[53]                         
The phrase “air of reality” connotes neither
plausibility nor likelihood.  The “air of reality test [is not] intended to
assess whether the defence is likely, unlikely, somewhat likely, or very likely
to succeed at the end of the day”:  R. v. Buzizi, 2013 SCC 27, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 248, at para. 16, citing R.
v. Cinous, 2002 SCC 29, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 54.  Moreover, in
determining whether to leave a defence to the jury, the trial judge assumes
that the evidence relied upon by the accused is true:  R. v. Fontaine,
2004 SCC 27, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 702, at para. 72; Cinous, at para. 53.  

[54]                         
The trial judge is not permitted to make
determinations about the credibility of witnesses, weigh the evidence, make
findings of fact, or draw determinate factual inferences:  R. v. Gauthier,
2013 SCC 32, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 403, at para. 25; Fontaine, at para. 72; Cinous, at para.
54.  Indeed, the “air of reality” test has been found by this Court to be
“reasonable” and “valid” precisely because the trial judge does not
weigh the evidence and thus “cannot be accused of usurping the role of the
jury or violating the accused’s rights”:  R. v. Osolin, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 595, at p. 691.

[55]                         
In the present
context, I find particularly apt this passage from the concurring reasons of
Sopinka J. in Osolin, at pp. 653-54:  

With respect
to the defence of mistaken belief, I agree with Cory J. that s. 265(4) “simply
sets out the basic requirements which are applicable to all defences” (p. 676)
and that it requires no more of the accused than the discharge of an
evidentiary burden to adduce or point to some evidence on the basis of which a
reasonable jury properly instructed could acquit.  I believe we are all in
agreement in this respect.  Indeed, this is the basis for our determination
that it is constitutional.  The term “evidentiary burden” and the definition I
have set out are well known to trial judges and well accepted.  I cannot
understand how the addition of the term “air of reality” helps in understanding
the duty of a trial judge with respect to this defence.  I am concerned that
when an attempt is made to add to the definition of a basic concept in the
criminal law, it only creates confusion.

[56]                         
While the Court has recognized that a “limited
weighing” of the evidence will be permitted, exceptionally, where the evidence
relied on by the accused is circumstantial, no weighing is permitted with
respect to direct evidence.  As the Chief Justice explains, “[t]he trial judge
may not engage in any weighing of direct evidence, since this would require a
consideration of the inherent reliability of the evidence” (para. 23).  

[57]                         
Accordingly, where there is direct evidence as
to all elements of a defence, the trial judge must put the defence to the jury
since, “[b]y definition, the only conclusion that needs to be reached in such a
case is whether the evidence is true” (Cinous, at para. 88).  And
whether the evidence is true, or at least raises a reasonable doubt as to the
guilt of the accused, is a matter ultimately reserved to the jury.  

[58]                         
In this case, the appellant’s evidence at trial
constitutes direct evidence and relates the facts upon which his defence of
provocation rests.  Where an accused gives evidence as to all the elements of
the defence, as the appellant did in this case, the trial judge is bound to
leave the assessment of that evidence to the jury:  R. v. Faid, [1983] 1
S.C.R. 265, at p. 276.

[59]                         
According to the Chief Justice, “[t]he air of reality test . . . requires more
than ‘some’ or ‘any’ evidence of the elements of a defence” (para. 22 (emphasis
added)).  In my respectful view, one should not impute to this passage a
meaning that it cannot have been intended to bear.  

[60]                         
As the Court made plain
in Cinous:

The full question is whether there is
evidence (some evidence, any evidence) upon which a properly instructed jury
acting judicially could acquit.  If there is any or some such
evidence, then the air of reality hurdle is cleared.  If there is no
such evidence, then the air of reality hurdle is not cleared. [Emphasis in
original; para. 62.]

And, leaving no room for
doubt in this regard, the Court later reiterated “the full question, which is
whether there is evidence (some evidence, any evidence) on the basis of
which a properly instructed jury acting reasonably could base an acquittal if
it believed the evidence to be true” (para. 83 (emphasis added)).

[61]                         
I recognize that the Court, in R. v. Mayuran,
2012 SCC 31, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 162, at para. 21, stated that “[i]t is not enough
for there to be ‘some evidence’ supporting the defence (Cinous, at para.
83).”  This passage must be read in line with established authority, including
the paragraph in Cinous to which it refers.  As appears from that very
paragraph, the Court has consistently held that the decisive question is
whether there is evidence upon which a properly instructed jury could
reasonably acquit:  Fontaine, at para. 71; Cinous, at para.
83; R. v. Thibert, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 37, at para. 7; Faid,
at p. 276; Parnerkar v. The Queen, [1974] S.C.R. 449, at p. 454. 

[62]                         
These principles are well settled.  They align
with the trust our criminal justice system places in the collective good sense
of juries.  And, they breathe life into the accused’s Charter  rights to
be presumed innocent (s. 11 (d)) and to have the benefit of a jury trial
where the maximum punishment for the alleged offence is at least five years
imprisonment (s. 11 (f)).

III

[63]                         
I turn now to the application of these
principles to the facts of this case.

[64]                         
I agree with the Chief Justice that the
appellant discharged his evidentiary burden on the objective component
of his defence of provocation.  In my respectful view, he met his evidentiary
obligation on the subjective component as well.  

[65]                         
The subjective component (or “element”) of the
defence of provocation requires that the accused acted (1) in response
to the provocative act or conduct; and (2) on the sudden before there was time
for his or her passion to cool:  Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, s. 232 ; see also R. v. Tran, 2010 SCC
58, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 350, at
para. 36.  The Chief Justice emphasizes that the second, “suddenness” portion
of the inquiry applies to both the provocation itself and the accused’s
reaction to it (para. 36).  In her opinion, there is no evidentiary basis upon
which a jury could reasonably conclude that the wrongful provocation was
sudden, in the sense that it surprised Mr. Pappas by catching his mind
unprepared.

[66]                         
The appellant’s evidence was that the deceased
had been extorting him for 18 months leading up to the killing (A.R., vol. II,
at p. 238).  When Mr. Pappas resisted, the deceased implied that he was
prepared to have Mr. Pappas’s mother killed (p. 239).  On the night in
question, the appellant did carry a concealed weapon.  He testified, however,
that he did not intend to use it (pp. 242, 245 and 292-93).  The deceased
responded to Mr. Pappas’s overtures by again implicitly threatening to kill his
mother (p. 303).  At this point, according to Mr. Pappas, his “mind shut down
and everything was just automatic. I drew my gun, I chambered a round, I fired”
(p. 304).

[67]                         
The sudden and unexpected nature of the
deceased’s provocative act emerges from the timeline of events on the night of
the killing.  Describing the deceased’s offer to give him money for a plane
ticket, and the deceased’s subsequent veiled threat to kill his mother, Mr.
Pappas testified:

He does me a favour from his point of
view one minute . . . and then the next minute he just told me what’s going to
happen . . . if I don’t get back and [indiscernible]
his fucking expensive toys. [A.R., vol. II, at p. 244]

[68]                         
Accepting this evidence as true, Mr. Pappas
plainly acted “on the sudden” — he “didn’t think about it” (A.R., vol. II, at
p. 241), but reacted immediately to the deceased’s provocation before there was
time for his passion to cool.  Indeed, the Chief Justice accepts that this
satisfies one dimension of the subjective “suddenness” inquiry.

[69]                         
According to the Chief Justice, however, the
record cannot support a finding that the provocation itself was sudden
because the deceased “had made similar statements repeatedly in the past”
(para. 37).

[70]                         
In R. v. Cairney, 2013 SCC 55, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 420, Justice Abella
addresses the manifest difficulties presented by a “predictability of
consequences” approach with regard to the objective element of provocation. 
The same holds true for the subjective element — the mere fact that the
deceased had made similar threats to the accused in the past does not mean that
the accused would have anticipated, or been prepared for, subsequent threats of
the same sort.  Plainly, a reiterated threat or insult can cause a previously
unprovoked person to “snap”.

[71]                         
The Court explicitly addressed this very
possibility in Thibert.  In considering whether a provocation is
“sudden” in the sense that it strikes upon a mind unprepared for it, the Court
held that

the background and history of
the relationship between the accused and the deceased should be taken into
consideration.  This is particularly appropriate if it reveals a long history
of insults, leveled at the accused by the deceased. . . . “[T]he last affront
may be comparatively trivial, merely the last straw that makes the worm turn,
so to speak”.  [para. 20]

 

(Citing
G. Williams, Textbook of Criminal Law (2nd ed. 1983).)

[72]                         
In this regard, the Chief Justice focuses on
whether Mr. Pappas’s “mind was prepared for the possibility that Kullman might
reject his pleas to end the extortion” (para. 41).  With respect, however, the
alleged provocative act was not the deceased’s failure to end the
extortion; rather, it was his sudden utterance — “I got great fucking
insurance” — which Mr. Pappas understood as a threat to his mother’s life
(A.R., vol. II, at p. 241).  This is amply supported by Mr. Pappas’s evidence
that he shot the deceased in order to protect his mother (A.R., vol. II, at pp.
240-42, 247 and 254-55).

[73]                         
Nor am I able to share the Chief Justice’s
characterization as “little more than . . . bald assertions” the appellant’s
evidence that he was unprepared for the deceased’s comments (para. 41).  

[74]                         
In Osolin, this Court affirmed that, in
order for a defence to be put to the jury, there must be “evidence beyond [a]
mere assertion” of the elements of the defence (pp. 686-87).  Using the defence
of provocation as an example, the Court held that while a “bare assertion” by
the accused — “I was provoked” — would not suffice, the “requisite evidence may
come from the detailed testimony of the accused alone” (p. 687 (emphasis
added)).

[75]                         
Read in this light, Mr. Pappas’s detailed
evidence of the circumstances surrounding the alleged provocation, including
his perceptions and explanations for his actions, can hardly be equated with a
“bare assertion” that he was provoked. 

[76]                         
Neither can Mr. Pappas’s description of the
provoking act be considered a single statement that is inconsistent with his
“principal narrative”:  Gauthier, at para. 61, cited by the Chief
Justice, at para. 24.  

[77]                         
I agree with the Chief Justice that the “only
passages in [Mr.] Pappas’ confession that support a loss of self-control are
the ones in which he describes his reaction upon hearing Kullman once again
make reference to the fact that [Kullman] had ‘insurance’” (para. 40).  These
descriptions constitute direct evidence of the suddenness of the provocation
and must be taken as true.  As such, they demonstrate that the appellant
discharged his evidentiary burden on the “sudden provocation” element of the
defence.

[78]                         
Whether these passages are “inconsistent” with
other evidence, however, necessarily requires a weighing of the evidence and an
assessment of its reliability.  That determination must properly be left to the
jury.  And the trial judge’s decision whether to leave the defence to the jury
must, in any event, be based on “the construction of the evidence most favourable
to the accused’s position” (Cinous, at para. 98).  The trial judge in
this case therefore committed no error in finding that Mr. Pappas’s evidence —
if accepted as true in whole or in part — was capable of supporting the
inference that the deceased’s comments constituted a sudden and unexpected act
of provocation.

IV

[79]                         
For the foregoing reasons, I am unable to agree
with the Chief Justice that the trial judge committed a reviewable error in
leaving the appellant’s defence of provocation to the jury.  As mentioned at
the outset as well, I would nevertheless dismiss the appeal for the reasons of
the majority in the Court of Appeal.

                    Criminal
law — Defences — Provocation — Self‑induced provocation — Whether fact
that accused induced act or words said to constitute provocation precludes defence
of provocation from being left to jury — Whether objective and subjective elements
of provocation established, lending an air of reality to this defence — Whether
defence of provocation should have been submitted to jury — Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46, s. 232 .

                    C
shot and killed his long‑time friend F.  At the time, C was living with F
and R, who was C’s cousin and F’s common law spouse.  F had a history of
physically abusing R.  On the day in question, F was drinking, became angry
with R and started to verbally abuse her.  C overheard F tell R that if her
back had not been sore, he would have thrown her across the kitchen.  At F’s
request, C left the room.  He retrieved a loaded shotgun.  Disturbed by the
argument that he was overhearing, C sat in another room, contemplating what to
do.  He decided to scare F to teach him a lesson and deter future aggression
against R.  He walked up to F, who was talking on the telephone and struck the
phone with the muzzle of the shotgun.  He then began to lecture F on his abuse
of R.  F reacted by saying, “What are you gonna do, shoot me? You don’t have
the guts to shoot me.”  F then started to leave the apartment.  When C called
out to F to “get back here”, F said: “Fuck you, you goof.  This is none of your
business, I’ll do with [R] whatever I want.”  F then walked out of the
apartment.  C followed him into the stairwell, where he shot F, killing him.  C
was charged with second degree murder and tried before a jury.  He argued that
he lacked the necessary intention to be guilty of murder, and in the
alternative that he had been provoked by F’s words to him.  The trial judge,
apparently concluding that there was some evidence to support all the elements
of the defence of provocation, charged the jury on that defence.  The jury
acquitted C of second degree murder and convicted him of manslaughter.  The
Court of Appeal allowed the Crown’s appeal and ordered a new trial.

                    Held
(Fish and Abella JJ. dissenting):  The appeal should be dismissed.

                    Per
McLachlin C.J. and Rothstein, Cromwell, Moldaver and Wagner JJ.:  The
trial judge erred in leaving the defence of provocation with the jury as there
was no air of reality to the defence.

                    The
air of reality test is intended to assess whether a properly instructed jury
acting reasonably could have a reasonable doubt as to whether the subjective
and objective elements of the defence of provocation are made out.  The
objective element of the defence of provocation asks whether there was some
evidence upon which a jury could have a reasonable doubt that an ordinary
person in C’s circumstances — which include having initiated a confrontation at
gunpoint — would be deprived of the power of self‑control by F’s
insults.  The history and background of the relationship between the victim and
the accused is relevant and pertinent to the “ordinary person” test, as are all
factors that would give the act or insult special significance to an ordinary
person.  However, that does not change the fact that a certain threshold level
of self‑control is always expected of the “ordinary person”.

                    While
the cases on self‑induced provocation do not always distinguish between
the objective and subjective elements of the defence, read generally they
confirm that the accused’s conduct may be relevant to both elements of the
defence and that it must be considered with other contextual factors to
determine whether there is an air of reality to the defence.  Self‑induced
provocation is not a special category of the defence attracting special
principles.  Rather, it describes a particular application of the general
principles that govern the defence of provocation.  There is no absolute rule
that a person who instigates a confrontation cannot rely on the defence of
provocation.  The fact that the victim’s response to the accused’s
confrontational conduct fell within a range of reasonably predictable reactions
may suggest that an ordinary person would not have lost self‑control,
although it must be weighed together with all other relevant contextual
factors.  As in all cases where the defence is raised, whether it goes to the
jury depends on whether the evidence provides an air of reality to it.

                    In
this case, there was evidence sufficient to support the subjective element —
that C in fact acted in response to the provocation before his passion had time
to cool.  However, there was no air of reality to the objective element of the
defence.  C argues that F’s words constituted a threat of imminent domestic
abuse sufficient to cause an ordinary person to lose self‑control.  However,
F was no longer behaving aggressively towards R when C approached.  His moment
of anger against R had passed.  The record simply does not support the
contention that an ordinary person would have viewed the victim’s words as a
threat of imminent domestic violence against R, leading to a loss of self‑control.

                    What
is left is a concern on C’s part to prevent future abuse against R and C’s
declared intention to achieve this by extracting a promise at gunpoint from F
to stop abusing her.  An ordinary person who seeks to extract a promise at
gunpoint would not be surprised if the person confronted rebuffs the overture
as did F here.  There is nothing on the record to support the element of sudden
shock required to cause an ordinary person to lose self‑control.  It
follows that a properly instructed jury acting reasonably could not have had a
reasonable doubt about whether F’s conduct was sufficient to deprive an
ordinary person of self‑control.

                    Per Fish and Abella JJ.
(dissenting):  The trial judge must determine whether the evidence is
reasonably capable of supporting the inferences necessary to make out the defence
of provocation.  In relation to the objective element, the judge must determine
whether there is evidence that could raise a reasonable doubt about whether the
accused was faced with a wrongful act or insult sufficient to deprive an
ordinary person of self‑control.  To determine how the “ordinary” person
would react to a particular insult, it is necessary to take the relevant
context and circumstances into account, including the history and background of
any relationship between the victim and the accused.  The assessment of the
evidence relevant to the objective element should not be skewed by placing
predominant emphasis on the aggressive conduct of the accused at the
determinative expense of the whole context.

                    F’s
words and the reaction they would elicit from an ordinary person cannot be
appreciated without considering the whole context, and, in particular, the
history of the relationship between C and F.  F and C were close friends.  The
only source of conflict between them was F’s long history of domestic violence
against R, C’s cousin whom he thought of as his “little sister”.  F had been
attacking R for over a decade. The assaults were frequent — often weekly.  They
were also severe.  C knew all about the assaults since R had repeatedly taken refuge
with C and his wife, and R was sometimes so badly injured that she was unable
to go to work.

                    Removing
the defence of provocation from the jury turns on the characterization that C
initiated an “aggressive confrontation”.  On another view of these facts,
however, F initiated the confrontation when he started verbally abusing and
threatening C’s cousin — acts that could, in light of F’s history of relentless
domestic abuse, readily and reasonably be interpreted as a prelude to another
brutal assault.  A jury might well conclude that the objective element of
provocation was met based on a credible threat that F would again abuse C’s
cousin, R.

                    While
F’s dismissive attitude towards C might have been predictable, a jury
could infer from the full context of this case that an ordinary person would
not predict F’s response that he would keep beating R if he felt like
it.  The objective element of the defence of provocation should be informed by
contemporary norms, including Charter values.  These do not include
aggressively proprietary attitudes about a spouse.  It is therefore troubling
to conclude, as the majority does, that it was “predictable” for F to react to
C’s warning by confirming his intention to continue inflicting domestic
violence.  It is difficult to accept that an expressed intention to continue
assaulting a spouse could ever be considered “predictable”.

                    The
trial judge’s decision to leave the provocation defence with the jury was
therefore proper.

                    The judgment of McLachlin C.J.
and Rothstein, Cromwell, Moldaver and Wagner JJ. was delivered by

                    The Chief justice — 

I.    Background

[1]                             
The law has long recognized that murder may be
reduced to manslaughter if the deceased provoked the attack by a wrongful act
or insult, causing the accused to act in the heat of passion.  This is called
the partial defence of provocation.

[2]                             
But what happens if the act of provocation by
the deceased was in response to an aggressive confrontation initiated by the
accused?  That is the problem at the heart of this case — sometimes referred to
as the problem of self-induced provocation.

A.  The Facts

[3]                             
The accused, Michael John Cairney, shot and
killed his long-time friend Stephen Ferguson.  At the time, Cairney was living
with Ferguson and Frances Rosenthal, who was Cairney’s cousin and the common
law spouse of Ferguson.  Ferguson had a history of drinking and physically
abusing Rosenthal.

[4]                             
On the day in question, Ferguson, who had been
drinking, became angry with Rosenthal because she had put a roast in the oven
that he wanted to cook himself.  Ferguson started to verbally abuse Rosenthal. 
Cairney overherd Ferguson tell Rosenthal that if her back had not been sore, he
would have thrown her across the kitchen.

[5]                             
At Ferguson’s insistence and Rosenthal’s
request, Cairney left the room. He retrieved a loaded shotgun from a duffle bag
in the closet.  Disturbed by the argument that he was overhearing, he sat in
the bathroom for five to ten minutes, contemplating what to do.  He decided to
scare Ferguson using the shotgun in order to teach him a lesson and deter
future aggression against Rosenthal.  He walked up to Ferguson, who was having
a conversation on the telephone, and smashed the phone with the muzzle of the
shotgun.  He then began to lecture Ferguson on his abuse of Rosenthal.

[6]                             
Ferguson reacted by saying, “What are you gonna
do, shoot me? You don’t have the guts to shoot me.” He then started to leave
the apartment. Cairney called out to Ferguson, “Get back here, I want to talk
to you.” At this point, Ferguson said the words relied on by the defence as
provocation, “Fuck you, you goof. This is none of your business, I’ll do with
Fran whatever I want”: A.R., vol. II, at p. 384. He then walked out of the
apartment.  Cairney followed him out of the apartment and to the stairwell.  He
shot Ferguson in the stairwell, killing him.

B.  The Trial

[7]                             
Cairney was charged with second degree murder
and tried before a jury.  He argued that he lacked the necessary intention to
be guilty of murder, and in the alternative that he had been provoked by
Ferguson’s words to him.

[8]                             
The Crown objected to the defence of provocation
going to the jury, maintaining that the defence had no air of reality in the
circumstances. After several exchanges with counsel, the trial judge inquired:

And so the
issue for me is whether there’s some evidence on each of the four questions,
the four components of provocation. And I can’t weigh that evidence.  I just
have to — if there is any evidence, then the issue has to be left to the jury.
[A.R., vol. I, at p. 129]

[9]                             
The trial judge then held that since there was
no evidence that Cairney had set Ferguson up deliberately to be able to advance
a provocation defence, she would leave the defence to the jury:

There’s
nothing in the evidence to suggest that Mr. Cairney planned in advance to
murder Mr. Ferguson and to set him up so that he would be in a position to
advance a provocation defence to turn murder into manslaughter; therefore, I
will allow provocation to go to the jury. [A.R., vol. I, at p. 151]

[10]                         
The trial judge, apparently concluding that
there was some evidence to support all the elements of the defence of
provocation, charged the jury on that defence.  The jury acquitted Cairney of
second degree murder and convicted him of manslaughter.

C.  The Court of Appeal

[11]                         
The Crown appealed the acquittal on second
degree murder, arguing, among other things, that there was no air of reality to
the defence of provocation.  The Alberta Court of Appeal agreed and ordered a
new trial: 2011 ABCA 272, 513 A.R. 345.

[12]                         
The Court of Appeal reviewed the test for
provocation, which consists of an objective element (that the act or insult was
of a nature to deprive an ordinary person of self-control) and of a subjective
element (that it actually deprived the accused of self-control), and concluded
that the objective element was not met.  Ferguson’s dismissive behaviour and
insulting remarks were not enough to provoke a loss of control in an ordinary
person:

Measured by an objective standard, and with concerns for the
encouragement of reasonable and non-violent behaviour, we are satisfied that
the victim’s oral retorts to Cairney’s threats of violence were not of
sufficient gravity to cause a loss of control.  Having initiated the unlawful
confrontation which led to Ferguson’s retorts, Cairney ought reasonably to have
understood that his conduct would elicit such a reaction on the victim’s part. 
Cairney had no reason to anticipate docile acquiescence from Ferguson in the
circumstances.  The reaction was foreseeable and, in any event, not of sufficient
gravity to provoke a murderous response. [para. 45]

[13]                         
The Court of Appeal also found that the
subjective element was not satisfied.  Cairney had not acted “suddenly”: para.
47.  He may have been angry that Ferguson had dismissed him so casually, but
the ensuing act of shooting Ferguson in the stairwell was not committed in the
heat of uncontrollable passion, in its view.

[14]                         
Since neither element was met, the trial judge
erred in leaving the defence of provocation to the jury.  The Court of Appeal
acknowledged the trial judge’s conclusion that the defence of provocation was
only one of the routes by which the jury could have reduced murder to
manslaughter; it could also have done so because it did not find intent to
kill.  It was impossible to know what factors entered into the mind of each of
the jurors.  It followed that the instruction with respect to provocation may
reasonably be viewed as having a material bearing on the deliberations of the
jurors and the jury’s verdict, and a new trial should be ordered.

D.  Legislation

[15]                         
Section 232  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1985, c. C-46 , provides:

232. (1) Culpable homicide that otherwise would be murder may be reduced
to manslaughter if the person who committed it did so in the heat of passion
caused by sudden provocation.

 

(2)
A wrongful act or an insult that is of such a nature as to be sufficient to
deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control is provocation for the purposes of this section if the
accused acted on it on the sudden and before there was time for his passion to
cool.

 

(3)
For the purposes of this section, the questions

 

(a)
whether a particular wrongful act or insult amounted to provocation, and

 

(b)
whether the accused was deprived of the power of self-control by the
provocation that he alleges he received,

 

are questions of fact, but no
one shall be deemed to have given provocation to another by doing anything that
he had a legal right to do, or by doing anything that the accused incited him
to do in order to provide the accused with an excuse for causing death or
bodily harm to any human being.

 

(4) Culpable homicide that otherwise would be murder is not
necessarily manslaughter by reason only that it was committed by a person who
was being arrested illegally, but the fact that the illegality of the arrest
was known to the accused may be evidence of provocation for the purpose of this
section.

II.  Discussion

[16]                         
The appellant says that the defence of
provocation had an air of reality on the evidence and that the trial judge
correctly left it to the jury. The Court of Appeal wrongly interfered with the
jury’s acquittal on murder, he asserts.

[17]                         
While the arguments are variously stated, the
case presents one basic issue: What is required to give an air of reality to
the defence of provocation where the provocative conduct of the deceased came
about as a result of the accused initiating an aggressive confrontation?

[18]                         
This in turn raises two questions.  First, when
must the defence be submitted to the jury? This is the threshold air of reality
question.  Second, does the fact that the accused induced the act or words said
to constitute provocation preclude the defence from being raised successfully?

A.  When Must the Defence Be
Submitted to the Jury — The “Air of Reality” Question

[19]                         
The trial judge appears to have acted on the
view that, provided there was any evidence supporting the elements of
the defence of provocation, she was required to leave the defence to the jury.

[20]                         
The Court of Appeal, by contrast, conducted a
detailed examination of the evidence that went into the merits of the defence.

[21]                         
Neither of these approaches is strictly correct.
“[T]he air of reality test [is not] intended to assess whether the defence is
likely, unlikely, somewhat likely, or very likely to succeed at the end of the
day”: R. v. Cinous, 2002 SCC 29, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 54, quoted
by Fish J. in R. v. Buzizi, 2013 SCC 27, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 248, at para.
16.  The question is whether a properly instructed jury acting reasonably could
have a reasonable doubt as to whether the elements of the defence of
provocation are made out: R. v. Tran, 2010 SCC 58, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 350,
at para. 41; R. v. Mayuran, 2012 SCC 31, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 162, at para.
21.  The trial judge may engage in a limited weighing of the totality of the
evidence to determine if a jury acting reasonably on that evidence could draw
the inferences necessary to have a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused
is guilty of murder, on the basis of the defence of provocation; see the
companion case R. v. Pappas, 2013 SCC 56, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 452. This
Court, per Abella J., described the appropriate approach to the air of
reality test in Mayuran:

In
determining whether a defence has an air of reality, there must be an
examination into the sufficiency of the evidence. It is not enough for there to
be “some evidence” supporting the defence (Cinous, at para. 83). The
test is “whether there is (1) evidence (2) upon which a properly instructed
jury acting reasonably could acquit if it believed the evidence to be true” (Cinous,
at para. 65). For defences that rely on indirect evidence or defences like
provocation that include an objective reasonableness component, the trial judge
must examine the “field of factual inferences” that can reasonably be drawn
from the evidence (Cinous, at para. 91). [para. 21]

[22]                         
If this air of reality test is met, the judge
should leave the defence to the jury.  While judges must ensure that there is
an evidential foundation for the defence, they should resolve any doubts as to
whether the air of reality threshold is met in favour of leaving the defence to
the jury.

[23]                         
This appeal turns on the application of the air
of reality test to the objective element of the defence of provocation. As will
be discussed further below, one of the requirements of the defence is that an
ordinary person placed in the circumstances of the accused would have been
deprived of self-control. Thus, the question is whether there was some evidence
upon which a properly instructed jury acting reasonably could have a reasonable
doubt that an ordinary person in Cairney’s circumstances — which
include having initiated a confrontation at gunpoint — would
be deprived of the power of self-control by Ferguson’s insults.

B.  The Elements of the Defence of
Provocation

          (1)   Historical Development of the Defence

[24]                         
At common law, as under s. 232  of the Criminal
Code , the defence of provocation consists of two elements — one subjective and one objective.

[25]                         
Historically, the first requirement was that the
accused have lost self-control as a result of the act or acts of the deceased. 
This was called the subjective element; the issue was simply whether the
accused in fact (i.e. subjectively) lost his self-control as a result of the
deceased’s acts.

[26]                         
The second requirement, which emerged
progressively as a means of limiting the availability of the defence, was that
the provoking act be capable of depriving a reasonable man (or ordinary person)
of his self-control.  This was called the objective element.

[27]                         
In the early cases, it was enough to establish
the subjective element. The defence originated in the 16th century concept of
“chance-medley” killings. These killings occurred “by chance (without
premeditation) upon a sudden brawle, shuffling, or contention”: E. Coke, The
Third Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England: Concerning High Treason,
and Other Pleas of the Crown, and Criminal Causes (1809, first published in
1644), at p. 57; G. Coss, “‘God is a righteous judge, strong and patient: and
God is provoked every day’. A Brief History of the Doctrine of Provocation in
England” (1991), 13 Sydney L. Rev. 570, at pp. 573-74.  They were not
premeditated and occurred in the heat of passion. They thus carried a lower
degree of moral culpability than premeditated, cold-blooded killings: Tran,
at para. 13.

[28]                         
However, the common law soon developed a means
of restraining the situations in which the defence was available. This
historical development was described in Tran:

. . .
the courts set out to create greater certainty by establishing specific
categories of “provocative events” that were considered “significant” enough to
result in a loss of self-control. In the seminal case, R. v. Mawgridge
(1707), Kel J. 119, 84 E.R. 1107, Lord Holt C.J. set out four categories of
provocation. [para. 15]

The use of limited categories in which the defence
was available reflected the belief that “people ought not to yield to
certain types of provocation, and that if they did the law should offer no
concession to them”: A. J. Ashworth, “The Doctrine of Provocation” (1976), 35 Cambridge
L.J. 292, at p. 295 (emphasis in original).

[29]                         
The use of categories as a means of limiting the availability of the
defence eventually gave way to a formal standard — individuals raising the defence were held to the
standard of self-control expected to be exercised by the “reasonable man”: R.
v. Welsh (1869), 11 Cox C.C. 336; Tran, at para. 16.

[30]                         
In addition, the common law precluded the defence from being raised
successfully in cases where the accused had intentionally sought a provocative
act in order to manufacture a pretense for killing: Mason’s Case (1756),
Fost. 132, 168 E.R. 66; A. J. Ashworth, “Self-Induced Provocation and the
Homicide Act”, [1973] Crim. L.R. 483, at pp. 484-85. For example, in Mason’s
Case, the accused lost a fight to his victim in a tavern. He thereafter
returned, wearing a concealed knife, and again challenged his victim to a
fight. The victim attempted to hit the accused, who pulled out his concealed
knife. The court held that the accused was not truly provoked by the victim’s
blows, but rather had sought out the provocation in order to have a pretense to
commit a murder.

[31]                         
In Canada, these common law approaches to restricting the availability
of the defence were both incorporated in the codification of the defence of
provocation: The Criminal Code, 1892, S.C. 1892, c. 29, s. 229. They
survive to this day. Section 232(2)  of the Criminal Code  contains the
common law’s objective requirement: only a wrongful act or an insult that is
“of such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the
power of self-control” can constitute provocation. Section 232(3)  precludes
“manufactured” provocation from grounding the defence, by providing that “no
one shall be deemed to have given provocation to another . . . by doing
anything that the accused incited him to do in order to provide the accused
with an excuse for causing death or bodily harm to any human being”.

          (2)   The
Modern Defence of Provocation

[32]                         
The elements of the defence of provocation were described by this Court
in Tran.

[33]                         
First, there is a two-fold objective element: “. . . (1) there must be a
wrongful act or insult; and (2) the wrongful act or insult must be sufficient
to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control”: Tran, at para.
25.

[34]                         
Second, there is a two-fold subjective element: “. . . (1) the accused
must have acted in response to the provocation; and (2) on the sudden before
there was time for his or her passion to cool”: Tran, at para. 36.

[35]                         
The bulk of the argument by the parties centred on the ordinary person
requirement: Would an ordinary person lose self-control after having initiated
a confrontation at gunpoint?  Cairney argues that the ordinary person standard
must be contextualized to the circumstances of this appeal, taking into account
the fact that for years he had been a powerless witness to Ferguson’s physical
abuse of his cousin Rosenthal, whom he loved like a sister.  The Crown, on the
other hand, contends that no ordinary person would seek out a confrontation at
gunpoint, and thereafter be surprised and lose self-control when the person who
is being threatened reacts dismissively.

          (a)   The
Purpose of the Ordinary Person Standard

[36]                         
The “ordinary person” element of the defence of provocation is something
of a paradox. The ordinary person does not lose control and kill someone in the
first place. However, the defence of provocation recognizes human frailties
that can lead to violence. As Professor Renke writes:

The
reality is that individuals will, in (what should be) extreme circumstances,
respond to provocations with homicidal violence. For centuries, the courts have
consistently recognized the potential for violence in our hearts and have
explained the provocation excuse as a concession to our human frailty — not just the frailty of the accused, but our frailty.
[Emphasis in original.]

 

(“Calm
Like a Bomb: An Assessment of the Partial Defence of Provocation” (2009), 47 Alta.
L. Rev. 729, at p. 769)

[37]                         
The law seeks to recognize this human weakness,
without going so far as to condone socially unacceptable acts of violence. The
“ordinary person” element serves to ensure that only losses of self-control
which comport “with contemporary society’s norms and values will attract the
law’s compassion”: Tran, at para. 30. As this Court underscored in R.
v. Thibert, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 37, per Cory J., the “ordinary person”
element implicitly entails a balancing exercise:

.
. . I think the
objective element should be taken as an attempt to weigh in the balance those
very human frailties which sometimes lead people to act irrationally and
impulsively against the need to protect society by discouraging acts of
homicidal violence. [para. 4]

          (b)   Contextualizing the Ordinary Person Standard

[38]                         
The “ordinary person” requirement limits the
availability of the defence of provocation, in order “to ensure that the
criminal law encourages reasonable and responsible behaviour”: Thibert,
at para. 14. The downside of the “ordinary person” standard is that, if applied
rigidly and in the abstract, it runs the risk of rendering the defence
unavailable in virtually all situations. As discussed, the truly ordinary
person in Canadian society does not kill a person who insults him or her. In response
to the potential unfairness that could result from a purely abstract conception
of the “ordinary person”, this Court has held that the standard must be applied
in a contextual manner:

.
. . the ordinary person must be taken to be of the same age, and sex, and must
share with the accused such other factors as would give the act or insult in
question a special significance. In other words, all the relevant background
circumstances should be considered.

 

(Thibert,
at para. 14)

[39]                         
As the appellant emphasizes in his submissions, “the history and
background of the relationship between the victim and the accused is relevant
and pertinent to the ‘ordinary person’ test”: Thibert, at para. 17.
Indeed, all contextual factors that would give the act or insult special
significance to an ordinary person must be taken into account: Thibert,
at para. 18.

[40]                         
However, the consideration of background
circumstances that contribute to the significance that an ordinary person would
attribute to an act or insult does not change the fact that a certain threshold
level of self-control is always expected of the “ordinary person”. For example,
characteristics of the accused such as “a propensity to drunken rages or short
tempered violence” are not relevant to the ordinary person test: Thibert,
at para. 15.  Only factors which contribute to the significance of an act or insult
should be taken into account when contextualizing the standard: Ashworth, “The
Doctrine of Provocation”, at p. 300.  The standard should not be adapted to
accommodate a particular accused’s innate lack of self-control; as “there is an
important distinction between contextualizing the objective standard, which is
necessary and proper, and individualizing it, which only serves to defeat its
purpose”: Tran, at para. 35.  As Professor Renke underscores,
“[p]rovocation should be recognized only at that point where the ordinary
person’s control has been taken to its limit, and that limit has been passed”: p.
772.

[41]                         
By appropriately contextualizing the ordinary person standard, the law
on provocation strikes a balance between recognizing human frailties that lead
to outbursts of violence, on the one hand, and the need to protect society by
discouraging acts of homicidal violence, on the other: Thibert, at para.
4.

          (c)   Self-Induced
Provocation

[42]                         
Self-induced provocation refers to the situation where the accused initiates
or invites the act or insult he says provoked him.  It is not a special
category of the defence of provocation.  The fact that the accused initiated or
invited the provocation is simply a contextual factor in determining whether
the subjective and objective elements of the defence are met.

[43]                         
The subjective component of the defence requires that “[t]he wrongful
act or insult must itself be sudden, in the sense that it ‘must strike upon a
mind unprepared for it’”: Tran, at para. 38, citing R. v. Tripodi,
[1955] S.C.R. 438, at p. 443. The subjective component is not met where the
accused in fact subjectively expected the victim’s response and, as a result,
did not act on the sudden. Depending on the circumstances, where the accused
precipitated the provocation, there may be no basis in the evidence for any
reasonable doubt as to whether the accused acted on the sudden.

[44]                         
The objective component asks whether the provoking act would cause an
“ordinary person” to lose his self-control, having regard to all the relevant
circumstances.  Again, depending on the circumstances, where the accused
precipitated the victim’s wrongful act or insult by aggressively confronting
him or her, there may be no basis in the evidence for any doubt as to whether
that act or insult would cause an ordinary person to lose self-control. The
fact that the victim’s response to the accused’s confrontational conduct fell
within a range of reasonably predictable reactions may suggest that an ordinary
person would not have lost self-control, although it must be weighed together
with all other relevant contextual factors.

[45]                         
It has been suggested that “the defence [of provocation] will not be
available where the accused is prepared for an insult or initiates a
confrontation and receives a predictable response”:  M. Manning and P.
Sankoff, Manning, Mewett & Sankoff: Criminal Law (4th ed.
2009), at p. 770 (emphasis added); see also D. Stuart, Canadian Criminal
Law: A Treatise (6th ed. 2011), at p. 590; H. Parent, Traité de droit
criminel, t. 1, L’imputabilité (3rd ed. 2008), at pp. 734-35.  This
is best understood not as an absolute rule, but as the usual result of
application of appropriate contextual factors to the question of whether an
ordinary person would have lost control.

[46]                         
The matter is always one of context, and in cases of
doubt, the question of whether the accused’s confrontational conduct undermines
the defence should be left to the jury.   In the case of Edwards v. The
Queen, [1973] A.C. 648, in which it was alleged that the accused’s acts of
blackmail gave rise to the victim’s provocative conduct, Lord Pearson
acknowledged that “[o]n principle it seems reasonable to say that . . .  a
blackmailer cannot rely on the predictable results of his own blackmailing
conduct as constituting provocation sufficient to reduce his killing of the
victim from murder to manslaughter”: p. 658. However, he went on to hold that
whether the inciting act would have this effect is a matter of fact that “would
in many cases be a question of degree to be decided by the jury”: p. 658; see
also Ashworth, “Self-Induced Provocation and the Homicide Act”, at p. 486.

          (d)  The
Cases on Self-Induced Provocation

[47]                         
While the cases on self-induced provocation do not always distinguish
between the objective and subjective elements of the defence, read generally
they confirm that the accused’s conduct in inciting provocation may be relevant
to both elements of the defence, and that it must be considered with other contextual
factors to determine whether there is an air of reality to the defence.

[48]                         
The accused’s conduct in inciting the alleged provocation was held to
deprive the defence of any air of reality in Salamon v. The Queen,
[1959] S.C.R. 404.  The accused had quarreled with the deceased, Joyce
Alexander, at an acquaintance’s house. The accused then returned alone to his
house, and waited for the deceased to come home as well. When the deceased
arrived, the accused started a confrontation during which he assaulted the
deceased, threw dishes at her and called her “a dirty name”: p. 407.
Eventually, the deceased retaliated by also calling the accused a dirty name,
at which point the accused shot her. This Court held that the defence of
provocation should not have been put to the jury:

The
evidence shows that from the time Joyce Alexander entered her home to that of
the fatal shot, the appellant, and not she, took, and kept throughout, the
initiative of the events leading to her death. He was evidently waiting for her
arrival. He started the quarrel during which she retaliated. . . . 

 

On
this evidence, [the] appellant cannot justify or excuse his actions in saying
that he was facing a situation characterized with suddenness, unexpectedness or
lack of premonition.
. . . There was no sudden provocation on the part of Joyce Alexander causing
sudden retaliation on his part. [Emphasis added; pp. 409-10.]

[49]                         
In R. v. Louison (1975), 26 C.C.C. (2d)
266 (Sask. C.A.), aff’d [1979] 1 S.C.R. 100, the accused sequestered a taxi
driver in the trunk of his own taxi. When he later opened the trunk, the driver
sprung out and hit him with a hammer. The accused grabbed the hammer away, and
proceeded to smash the driver’s skull with it, killing him. At trial, the
accused argued that he acted in the heat of the passion aroused by the hammer
attack. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, per Culliton C.J., held that
the provocation was self-induced and that the driver’s attempt to escape was
objectively predictable:

In
my view there could not be a situation in which the appellant had and kept the
initiative throughout more completely than in the present case. . . . 

 

. . .

 

.
. . I am satisfied that any reasonable person who had treated the deceased
as did the appellant, would expect that person to use any means at his disposal
to try and effect his escape if the occasion to do so arose. The striking
of the appellant by the deceased is not an act for which his mind would be
unprepared or would take his understanding by surprise, or that would set his
passions aflame. Such an act was one that was not only foreseeable and
predictable, but was one to be expected if the deceased was afforded any
opportunity to escape. [Emphasis added; pp. 286-87.]

[50]                         
Similarly, in R. v. Squire, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 13, this Court found
that an off-duty police officer who had gone out looking to pick fights in bars
could not raise the defence of provocation, as no jury acting reasonably could
conclude that the accused had been provoked in such a manner as to deprive an
ordinary person of the power of self-control:

It must
be remembered that on the evidence the respondent was, throughout the
disgraceful incidents of the evening, a bad-tempered aggressor and that he
seized on the slightest confrontation by [the deceased] to again become the
aggressor. If, during the fight which followed . . . he suffered a couple of
kicks of indefinite violence, the provocation resulting therefrom could not
possibly have caused a police officer to draw his gun and fire five shots at
his assailant. [pp. 21-22]

[51]                         
More recent cases have also confirmed that the defence of
provocation may lack an air of reality when the accused initiated an aggressive
confrontation which resulted in predictable acts of provocation. In R. v.
Gibson, 2001 BCCA 297, 153 B.C.A.C. 61, the accused initiated a physical
fight with the deceased. He lost the physical confrontation. The deceased
pushed the accused away and made a dismissive gesture. The accused felt
humiliated and stabbed the deceased with a knife as he was walking away from
the scene of the confrontation. The British Columbia Court of
Appeal held that there was no air of reality to the defence of provocation,
since the provocation was not sudden and would not have caused an ordinary
person to have lost his self-control.  Ryan J.A. suggested that an ordinary
person who initiates a fist fight would not lose control when he receives blows
in retaliation:

. . . the
sequelae of a lost match (as in Squire, the not unexpected blows
exchanged during a consensual fight) are not such as to deprive the ordinary
person of his power of self-control. . . .  [T]he ordinary
person standard is adopted to fix the degree of self-control and restraint
expected of all in society. It recognizes human frailty when the threshold test
is passed and a person is provoked beyond the level of tolerance of the
ordinary person. Based on the evidence in this case no jury could find that
under the same circumstances an ordinary young man in the appellant’s place
would have been provoked by the actions, words and gestures of the deceased so
as to cause him to lose his power of self-control. [para. 86]

[52]                         
Implicit in the appellate court’s reasoning is
the conclusion that the victim’s response — inflicting
minor damage in the fight the accused had initiated and then walking away — was within the range of reasonably anticipated responses. No
other contextual factors suggested that an ordinary person would have lost
self-control in the circumstances.  Accordingly, there was no air of reality to
the defence.

[53]                         
In the Tran case, this Court held that an accused who knew
that his wife was seeing another man could not claim that finding her in bed
with that man had “str[uck] upon a mind unprepared for it”:  para. 45. The
accused in Tran had maintained the initiative throughout: he had entered
his estranged wife’s apartment unexpectedly, without being invited, and
proceeded to attack his wife and her lover when he found them in bed together.
Although this Court analyzed the predictability of the allegedly provocative
act only under the subjective component of the test, there was an implied objective
dimension to the analysis. An “ordinary person” who burst into his estranged
wife’s apartment — and who knew
that she had taken a new lover — could reasonably anticipate that he would
discover the wife and her lover in bed.

[54]                         
Finally, I come to the case Thibert. In Thibert, a
majority of this Court held that the defence of provocation was properly left
to the jury, notwithstanding evidence that the accused’s conduct had
precipitated the wrongful act or insult relied on as provocation.  The accused,
Thibert, who was distraught because his wife wanted to leave him and had begun
seeing another man, went to his wife’s workplace in an attempt to convince her
to stay with him. He had placed a loaded rifle in his car. He met his wife in
the parking lot adjacent to her workplace. The wife’s lover interrupted the
conversation. The accused took the rifle out of his car and pointed it at him. 
The deceased began walking towards the accused, with his hands on the wife’s
shoulders and swinging her back and forth, all the while challenging the
accused to shoot him. The accused shot him, and raised the defence of
provocation at trial.

[55]                         
A majority of this Court, per Cory J., held that the trial judge
had not erred in leaving the defence of provocation with the jury.  The majority
reasons focused predominantly on whether the accused could have subjectively
lost control as a result of the victim’s taunts. The majority concluded that,
since the accused did not expect to see his wife’s lover at the meeting, the
confrontation with the deceased was unforeseen. Accordingly, the majority held
that the subjective element could be met and that, by extension, there was an
air of reality to the defence: Thibert, at para. 27. The accused could
not be said to have sought out the confrontation, according to the majority’s
reasoning.  The reasons also referred to the significance that an ordinary
person in the accused’s circumstances would attribute to the taunts, but did
not explore how the objective element of the defence, as analyzed in this case,
would be met in a situation of self-induced provocation.  The majority appears
to have relied heavily on the fact that, although the case was close to the
line, deference should be shown to the trial judge who had left the defence to
the jury: para. 33. Thibert is distinguishable from the present case, in
which Cairney sought out a confrontation with Ferguson at gunpoint.

[56]                         
Taken as a whole, the cases support the view that the fact that
provocation is “self-induced” by the accused may be relevant to both the
objective and subjective components of the defence.   Self-induced provocation
is not a special category of the defence attracting special principles. 
Rather, it describes a particular application of the general principles that
govern the defence of provocation.  There is no absolute rule that a person who
instigates a confrontation cannot rely on the defence of provocation.  As in
all cases where the defence of provocation is raised, whether the defence goes
to the jury depends on whether the evidence provides an air of reality to it. 
However, the fact that an accused sought out an aggressive confrontation and
received a predictable response is a factor which may deprive the defence of an
air of reality.

III. Application

[57]                         
The question is whether on the evidence
Cairney’s defence of provocation possessed an air of reality. The trial judge
left the matter to the jury, although she appears to have applied a “some
evidence” test instead of the air of reality test.  The Court of Appeal
disagreed, finding that there could be no reasonable doubt as to whether the
objective or subjective elements of the defence were present.

[58]                         
In my view, this appeal can be resolved on the objective element of the
test, which asks whether there was a wrongful act or insult by
the victim, sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of
self-control.

[59]                         
The alleged wrongful act or insult was the deceased’s
words to Cairney when Cairney confronted him at gunpoint: “Fuck you, you goof. 
This is none of your business, I’ll do with Fran whatever I want.”

[60]                         
Cairney argues that these words constituted a threat of
imminent domestic abuse sufficient to cause an ordinary person to lose
self-control.  The record does not support this contention. Ferguson was
having a conversation on the telephone when Cairney approached.  He was no
longer behaving aggressively towards Rosenthal —
his moment of anger against Rosenthal had passed.  Moreover, Ferguson was
attempting to leave the apartment when he spoke those words. The record, as the
Court of Appeal concluded, simply does not support the contention that an
ordinary person would have viewed the victim’s words as a threat of imminent
domestic violence against Rosenthal, leading to a loss of self-control.

[61]                         
What we are left with is a concern on Cairney’s part to prevent future
abuse against Rosenthal, and Cairney’s declared intention to achieve this by
extracting a promise at gunpoint from Ferguson to stop abusing her.  An
ordinary person who seeks to extract a promise at gunpoint would not be
surprised if the person confronted rebuffs the overture, in words like those
used by the victim here.  Ferguson’s response fell within a range of
predictable responses. There is nothing on the record to support the element of
sudden shock required to cause an ordinary person to lose self-control.  It
follows that a properly instructed jury acting reasonably could not have had a
reasonable doubt about whether Ferguson’s conduct was sufficient to deprive an
ordinary person of the power of self-control.

[62]                         
There was evidence, provided by Cairney’s
testimony, sufficient to support the subjective element — that Cairney in fact
acted in response to the provocation before his passion had time to cool. The
Court of Appeal entered into a minute weighing of the evidence that went into
the merits of the defence, by examining whether Cairney’s passions had time to
cool during the time that he followed Ferguson to the apartment building’s
stairwell. This approach went well beyond the requirements of the air of
reality test — the test only requires that there be an
evidential foundation on which a properly instructed jury acting reasonably
could find that there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused is
guilty of murder, on the basis of the defence of provocation. However, the
Court of Appeal’s error in assessing the subjective element does not change the
outcome of this appeal, since there is no air of reality to the objective
element of the defence.

[63]                         
In this case deference to the trial judge is not
appropriate, since she appears not to have applied the correct test in deciding
whether to leave the defence of provocation to the jury.

[64]                         
I add the following, from the perspective of
policy as it applies to cases such as this. Violent confrontations like the
gunpoint lecture that led to the death of Ferguson are to be discouraged. Where
conduct of this nature occurs, it will generally play a role in assessing
whether the defence of provocation meets the air of reality test, particularly under
the objective element of the defence. The law does not condone the initiation
of gunpoint lectures, regardless of the cause that led the accused to pick up a
weapon.

[65]                         
Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal and
affirm the order for a new trial.

                    The
reasons of Fish and Abella JJ. were delivered by

[66]                         
Abella J. (dissenting) — I have had the benefit of reading the Chief
Justice’s reasons and agree that there was evidence to support the subjective
element of the provocation defence. With great respect, however, I disagree
with her conclusions on the objective element of the defence. In my view, the
trial judge did not err in leaving the defence with the jury.

[67]                         
The role of the trial judge in deciding what
defences to put to the jury is to act as gatekeeper and “review the evidence
[to] determine whether, if believed, it could permit a properly
instructed jury acting reasonably to acquit” (R. v. Cinous, 2002 SCC 29,
[2002] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 87 (emphasis in original)).  This threshold
determination “is not aimed at deciding the substantive merits of the defence”,
and the trial judge must not make determinations of credibility, weigh
evidence, make findings of fact, or draw determinate factual inferences (Cinous,
at paras. 54 and 87).

[68]                         
For defences like provocation, the trial judge
must determine whether the evidence is reasonably capable of supporting the
inferences necessary to make out the defence (R. v. Tran, 2010 SCC 58,
[2010] 3 S.C.R. 350, at para. 41). When carrying out this “limited weighing” of
the evidence, the trial judge “does not draw determinate factual inferences,
but rather comes to a conclusion about the field of factual inferences that
could reasonably be drawn from the evidence” (Cinous, at para. 91; see
also R. v. Mayuran, 2012 SCC 31, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 162, at para. 21).

[69]                         
In relation to the objective element of
provocation, the judge must determine whether there is evidence that could
raise a reasonable doubt about whether the accused was faced with a wrongful
act or insult sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of self-control (Tran,
at para. 25).  To determine how the “ordinary” person would react to a
particular insult, it is necessary to take the relevant context and
circumstances into account, but without going so far as to accept idiosyncratic
characteristics of the accused that would subvert the objective standard (Tran,
at paras. 31-35). One clearly relevant contextual circumstance that informs the
inquiry is the history and background of any relationship between the victim
and the accused (R. v. Thibert, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 37, at paras. 16-19).

[70]                         
In this case, Ferguson’s words and the reaction
they would elicit from an ordinary person cannot be appreciated without
considering the whole context, and, in particular, the history of the
relationship between Cairney and Ferguson. The majority’s approach concentrates
mainly on one aspect of the evidence — Cairney confronting Ferguson with a gun
— to the exclusion of other evidence that could well have led the jury to
conclude that the objective element of provocation was met based on a credible
threat that Ferguson would again abuse Cairney’s cousin, Fran Rosenthal.

[71]                         
The predictability of the alleged provocation is
certainly relevant to the analysis. But the assessment of the evidence relevant
to the objective element should not be skewed by placing predominant emphasis
on the aggressive conduct of the accused at the determinative expense of the
whole context. An analysis that overwhelmingly focuses on whether the victim’s
acts were the predictable consequence of the accused’s aggressive conduct
appears to me to be too restrictive. It is noteworthy that two of the
commentators cited by the majority in support of denying the defence of
provocation “where the accused . . . initiates a confrontation and receives a
predictable response” in fact criticise such an approach (Morris Manning
and Peter Sankoff, Manning, Mewett & Sankoff: Criminal Law (4th
ed. 2009), at pp. 770-72; Don Stuart, Canadian Criminal Law: A Treatise (6th
ed. 2011), at p. 592).

[72]                         
Ferguson and Cairney were close friends. The
only source of conflict between them, which ultimately led to the killing, was
Ferguson’s long history of domestic violence against Fran Rosenthal, whom
Cairney thought of as his “little sister”.

[73]                         
Ferguson had been attacking Fran Rosenthal for
over a decade. The assaults were frequent — often weekly. They were also
severe: Rosenthal testified about incidents such as Ferguson hitting her in the
head with a golf club.  Cairney knew all about the assaults since Rosenthal had
repeatedly taken refuge with him and his wife.  She would show up bruised and
injured, sometimes so badly that she was unable to go to work.

[74]                         
Less than a year before the shooting, Cairney
had witnessed one of the attacks. He had found Ferguson kneeling on Fran Rosenthal’s
throat, choking her to the point of unconsciousness. Cairney had to push
Ferguson off of Rosenthal, and spent that entire night with Ferguson to ensure
that he did not attack her again. A few weeks before the shooting, Rosenthal
told Cairney that she had thought she was going to die that time.

[75]                         
The incident leading to the shooting had the
potential to turn into another assault. Ferguson suddenly became enraged and
started screaming at Fran Rosenthal. He called her a “fuckin’ bitch” and a
“fuckin’ cunt” and threatened her with: “If it wasn’t for your sore back, I’d
be throwing you against the walls right now.” He ordered Rosenthal to tell
Cairney to leave. When she did, Cairney expressed his concern to her that
Ferguson was going to start beating her. She did not deny it. In
cross-examination, she admitted that she wanted Cairney to leave because danger
to her was imminent and she did not want him to see it.

[76]                         
While the majority suggests that Ferguson was
“no longer behaving aggressively towards Rosenthal” and that “his moment of
anger against Rosenthal had passed” by the time Cairney confronted him, the
opposite inference can also be drawn from this record. Notably, Cairney’s
evidence about the progression of the fight between Ferguson and Rosenthal is
that it continued to escalate after Cairney left the room at Rosenthal’s
request. Cairney testified during cross-examination, for instance, that hearing
Ferguson screaming threats at Rosenthal was what led him to come back in and
confront Ferguson:

Q    And then in spite of your concerns about the potential for
violence then, you actually do leave the two alone for a while, in spite of
that explosive, you know, kind of powder keg situation. Right?

 

A    Right.

 

Q    And you come back with the gun, smash the phone. Right?

 

A    After I heard the argument escalating and Steve [Ferguson]
screaming at her.

 

Q    Oh, okay. What was Steve saying then in terms of the
argument escalating?

 

A    I believe the words were, You never fucking listen, you
fucking cunt. I heard Frannie yelling back at Steve. That’s when I had enough.
And all I wanted to do was scare Steve. I did not want to shoot him. [Emphasis
added.]

[77]                         
At that point, Cairney confronted Ferguson with
the gun and said:

Do you think you own her? Do you think
that she’s your property? Do you think that you can beat the shit out of her
anytime you want? I said, I had it up to here, buddy. I said, listen, here you
are all those months, when you’re not working and she’s buying your beer and
whatever and toting [sic] to your every whim, and whenever you get
pissed off about anything, you use her as your punching bag.

[78]                         
The response that caused Cairney to snap,
according to his testimony, was this: “Fuck you, you goof. This is none of your
business. I’ll do with Fran whatever I want.” The provocative act was not
Ferguson responding dismissively to Cairney pointing the gun. It was
his emphatic assertion that he would continue the conduct towards Fran
Rosenthal that Cairney had just confronted him about — “beat[ing] the shit out
of her” and using her as his “punching bag”.

[79]                         
The facts of this case illustrate the frailty of
making the availability of the provocation defence hinge on a “who started it?”
inquiry in circumstances involving a back-and-forth between the victim and the
accused. Removing the defence from the jury turns on the characterization that
Cairney initiated an “aggressive confrontation”. On another view of these
facts, however, Ferguson initiated the confrontation when he started verbally
abusing and threatening Cairney’s cousin — acts that could, in light of
Ferguson’s history of relentless domestic abuse, readily and reasonably be
interpreted as a prelude to another brutal assault.

[80]                         
Bielby J.’s decision to leave provocation to the
jury was therefore a proper one. Her review of the evidence relevant to the
objective element of provocation was flawless:

The event which Mr. Cairney
testified caused him to lose control was Mr. Ferguson telling him he was a goof
and that he would do what he wanted to with Fran, said as he walked away from
Mr. Cairney who had just told him to come back. That event must be considered
in the context of what occurred just before and in the context of Mr. Cairney’s
knowledge of the history of domestic violence between Mr. Ferguson and Ms.
Rosenthal. . . .

 

. . .

 

You must take into account
everything that was said or done at the time and must also consider Mr. Cairney
and Mr. Ferguson’s relationship and history. This includes evidence of Mr.
Cairney’s knowledge of prior incidents when Mr. Ferguson had struck or been
violent toward Ms. Rosenthal, including the one he personally witnessed the
prior summer when he saw Mr. Ferguson place his knee on her neck, leaving her
almost unconscious, where Mr. Cairney intervened to pull Mr. Ferguson off her,
the fact that she told Mr. Cairney she thought she was going to die that night
in a conversation held with him in January 2007 and the fact Mr. Cairney was
attempting to scold Mr. Ferguson over his demeaning and violent treatment of
Fran over the years.

[81]                         
The majority would, however, remove the defence
of provocation from the jury solely because Ferguson’s words “fell within a
range of predictable responses” to what it calls a “gunpoint lecture”.  While
Ferguson’s dismissive attitude towards Cairney might have been predictable,
it would, in my view, be open for a jury to infer from the full context of this
case that an ordinary person would not predict Ferguson’s response that
he would keep beating Rosenthal if he felt like it.

[82]                         
This Court said in Tran that the objective
element of the defence of provocation should be informed by contemporary norms,
including Charter values. These do not include aggressively proprietary
atavistic attitudes. It is therefore troubling, with respect, to
conclude that it was “predictable” for Ferguson to react to Cairney’s warning
by confirming his intention to continue inflicting domestic violence. It is
difficult to accept that an expressed intention to continue assaulting a spouse
could ever be considered “predictable”.

[83]                         
It is true that “[t]he law does not condone the
initiation of gunpoint lectures”, as the majority observes. The law never
condones the conduct that gives rise to the defence of provocation. That is why
provocation is only a partial defence, reducing the offence from murder to
manslaughter and why the defence of provocation in the circumstances of this
case in no way absolves the accused. Cairney’s nine-year prison sentence was
based on the fact that he caused Ferguson’s death by using a firearm in the
dispute.

[84]                         
I would allow the appeal and restore the
conviction and nine-year sentence for manslaughter.

on appeal from the court of appeal for ontario

                    Criminal law — Charge to jury — Eyewitness
evidence — Whether trial judge instructed jury that it could convict accused
based on eyewitness evidence alone — If so, whether such an instruction would
constitute an error.

                    Criminal law — Evidence — Fresh evidence — Hair
clipping evidence relied upon by Crown to explain accused’s appearance at time
of arrest as well as after‑the‑fact change of appearance — New
forensic evidence reports and testimony to the effect that most hair clippings
did not originate from scalp — Whether accused’s motion to adduce fresh evidence
should be granted.

                    In
the early morning of July 6, 2002, two men, one wearing a blue/green
shirt, shot and killed C.M. in a Toronto nightclub.  E was seen leaving the
club in a car registered to the appellant H’s mother, with whom H lived.  Multiple
witnesses were able to confidently identify E as the shooter.  Given H’s
connection to the residence and a database lookup that revealed he had a prior
firearm conviction, the police considered him a suspect as well.  L.M., who
witnessed the shooting, was shown a lineup which included one photo of H that
was taken roughly two years earlier.  When asked about the identity of the
shooter in the blue/green shirt, she selected H’s photo.  Three weeks after the
shooting, L.M. participated in a second photo lineup which contained the photo
of H taken on the day of his arrest.  L.M. did not select any photo from this
sequence.  E and H were subsequently charged with the first degree murder of
C.M. and the attempted murder of his brother. 

                    The
Crown’s case against H consisted of testimony from L.M. and four pieces of
physical evidence: bullets found in a sock in a laundry hamper in H’s bedroom;
a white T‑shirt in the same hamper with one granule of gunshot residue on
it; hair clippings from a newspaper in the garbage of the bathroom nearest to
H’s bedroom; and hair clippings in an electric razor found in H’s nightstand. 
The Crown’s theory was that H shaved his head upon returning home from the
shooting.  This was necessary to explain the discrepancy between the eyewitness
testimony, which indicated that the second shooter had dreadlocks that were two
inches or longer, and the length of H’s hair when he was arrested, which was
very short.  It was also used to explain why L.M. was not able to identify H
based on the arrest photo shown to her three weeks after the shooting.  The
Crown also suggested that the haircut represented an after‑the‑fact
attempt by H to change his appearance to cover up his involvement in the
shooting.  The jury found E and H guilty of first degree murder of C.M. and
attempted murder of his brother.  In the Court of Appeal, H challenged his
conviction on the bases that the jury’s verdict was unreasonable and that the
trial judge erred in instructing the jury on eyewitness identification.  The
court found that the trial judge did not instruct the jury that it could
convict on L.M.’s testimony alone and held that the jury’s verdict was not
unreasonable because, despite weaknesses in L.M.’s eyewitness testimony, there
was other confirmatory evidence presented to the jury. 

                    While
the application for leave to appeal was pending before this Court, H filed a
motion to compel the Crown to release hair clipping
evidence for forensic testing.  H sought to forensically examine the hair
clippings to determine from what part of the body the clippings came.  This
Court allowed the motion.  H subsequently filed a motion to adduce the reports
and testimony of experts who conducted the forensic examination.

                    Held:
 The appeal should be allowed, the motion to adduce fresh evidence should be
granted and the matter should be remanded for retrial.

                    Per McLachlin C.J. and LeBel, Abella, Rothstein, Cromwell and
Wagner JJ.:  It would have been an error to instruct the jury that it
could convict H based on L.M.’s testimony alone.  Where the Crown relies on an
eyewitness identification, the trial judge has a duty to caution the jury
regarding the well‑recognized frailties of identification evidence.  However,
a properly instructed jury may conclude, notwithstanding the frailties of
eyewitness identification, that the eyewitness’ testimony is reliable and may
enter a conviction on those grounds.  This may be so even where the Crown has
relied on only a single eyewitness.  However, where the Crown’s case consists
solely of eyewitness testimony that would necessarily leave reasonable doubt in
the mind of a reasonable juror, the trial judge must direct an acquittal upon a
motion for directed verdict.  L.M.’s testimony, in and of itself, would not
have permitted a reasonable juror to conclude without reasonable doubt that H
was one of the shooters and therefore, it would have been an error for the
trial judge to instruct the jury that it could convict H based solely on L.M.’s
evidence.  While L.M.’s
testimony on its own could not have supported an inference of guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt, the trial judge’s instruction, read as a whole, did not
instruct the jury that it could convict H based solely on her testimony.  Rather, in reviewing L.M.’s testimony, the trial judge described each
of the specific problems with her identification and instructed the jury that
it must look to confirmatory evidence.  The trial judge was not circumscribed
to instruct the jury as to the sufficiency of L.M.’s testimony using any
particular words and he must be afforded some latitude in determining the best
way to convey to the jury the relevant legal principles and how they apply to
the evidence adduced at trial.  The trial judge put great care into his jury
charge and, in particular, into the instructions as to eyewitness evidence.  L.M.’s
testimony in conjunction with the confirmatory evidence was sufficient to
support the conclusion that H was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and, thus,
there was no error in the jury charge.

                    The
motion to adduce fresh evidence should be granted and a new trial should be
ordered.  H’s fresh evidence consists of affidavits and cross‑examinations
of two forensic experts, in which each expert provides an opinion as to the
percentage of hairs in the newspaper and the razor that came from H’s scalp, as
opposed to his face or trunk.  The experts agreed that the samples taken were
predominantly facial hairs.  The Crown’s experts conducted a paper review and
testified that there was no evidence to support the proposition that the hair
clippings represented a head shave.  The overriding consideration upon a motion
to adduce fresh evidence is “in the interests of justice” and this requires
consideration of the principles enunciated in Palmer v. The Queen.  The
Crown has conceded that the expert evidence H seeks to adduce is credible.  Mere
lack of knowledge on the part of H’s trial counsel without any indication that
he inquired into the possibility of obtaining and presenting the evidence is a
factor against admitting the evidence for the first time on appeal.  However,
in view of the fact that this is a criminal case, involving charges of the most
serious nature, the evidence should not be excluded solely on the basis of a
lack of diligence.  It cannot reasonably be disputed that H’s fresh evidence
bears on a decisive issue.  The
evidence of hair clippings was used to explain the discrepancy between the
eyewitness description of the shooter and H’s actual appearance at the time of
arrest.  This was also how the Crown explained L.M.’s
inability to identify H based on his arrest photo.  The hair clippings were also adduced as evidence that
H had attempted an after‑the‑fact change of his appearance.  The evidence was directly relevant to whether H was in fact the
shooter in the blue/green shirt.  The fresh evidence that H seeks to adduce could
reasonably be expected to have affected the jury’s verdict.  The Crown relied
heavily on the haircut evidence at trial.  The significance of the hair
clippings was also reflected in the jury charge.  The Court of Appeal too
recognized that the hair clipping evidence was significant to the Crown’s case
and noted that the hair clippings allowed for a powerful inference of guilt.  Given
the significance of the haircut to the Crown’s case, the fresh evidence could
reasonably be expected to have affected the result.  For these reasons, H’s
motion to adduce fresh evidence should be granted.  The appropriate remedy here
is a new trial.

                    Per Fish J.:  There is agreement that the appellant’s motion to adduce
fresh evidence should be granted, that the appeal should be allowed and that a
new trial should be ordered.  However, the trial judge made a fatal error by
instructing the jury that it could convict the appellant on the evidence of L.M.
alone.  

                    Crown
counsel asked the judge to instruct the jury that they could convict the
appellant on the evidence of one eyewitness alone.  Counsel made clear that he
was referring specifically to the testimony of L.M.  In his closing address,
Crown counsel proceeded on the understanding that the trial judge would charge
the jury to that effect. At no point in his charge did the trial judge correct
these assertions by the Crown.  Pursuant to the Crown’s closing argument, the
jury would thus have assumed that it was entitled to convict the appellant
based solely on L.M.’s eyewitness identification.  This misapprehension of the
law was reinforced by the trial judge in his instructions to the jury.  Although
the trial judge urged caution, he informed the jury in unmistakable terms that
the testimony of one eyewitness could properly ground a conviction.  The jury
would therefore have understood that this rule applied unless instructed
otherwise for a particular witness.  No such instruction was ever given.  On
the contrary, the trial judge explained that identification evidence is
stronger if the accused was previously known to the witness.  This was
indisputably a direct reference to L.M.’s evidence implicating the appellant.  The
trial judge’s subsequent instructions regarding L.M.’s evidence further
reinforced Crown counsel’s uncorrected statement to the jury that they could
convict the appellant on her photo identification alone.  It is not possible in
light of this record to conclude that the trial judge did not instruct the jury
that it could convict the appellant on the evidence of L.M. alone.

Introduction

[1]                             
Leighton Hay was convicted of first degree
murder and attempted murder for a shooting that took place in a Toronto
nightclub.  He appeals his conviction on two grounds.  First, he argues that
the trial judge erred by instructing the jury that he could be convicted based
solely on the testimony of the one eyewitness who implicated him at trial. 
Second, he has filed a motion in this Court to adduce fresh evidence, which, he
says, warrants acquittal or a new trial.  

[2]                             
I agree with the Court of Appeal that the trial
judge did not err in instructing the jury.  The eyewitness testimony against
Mr. Hay on its own could not have supported an inference of guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt; however, the trial judge’s instruction, read as a whole, did
not instruct the jury that it could convict Mr. Hay based solely on her
testimony.  

[3]                             
However, Mr. Hay’s motion to adduce fresh
evidence should be granted.  He has asked this Court to consider evidence from
two experts who have forensically examined hair clipping exhibits that the
Crown relied on at trial to establish that Mr. Hay shaved his head after the
shooting.  The evidence was used to explain the discrepancy between the
eyewitness description of the shooter and Mr. Hay’s actual appearance at the
time of arrest.  It was also adduced as evidence that Mr. Hay had attempted an
after-the-fact change of his appearance.  The fresh evidence indicates that the
hair clippings did not originate from Mr. Hay’s scalp.  In my view, Mr. Hay has
satisfied the standard for adducing fresh evidence articulated in Palmer v.
The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759, at p. 775, and the appropriate remedy is a
new trial. 

II.      
Factual Background

[4]                             
In the early morning of July 6, 2002, two men
shot and killed Collin Moore in a Toronto nightclub.  The men also shot at
Collin’s brother, Roger Moore, who escaped with a graze to his forehead.  

[5]                             
The evidence at trial established that Collin
was hosting a monthly fundraising event at the nightclub.  Sometime after
midnight, three or four men arrived at the club and refused to pay the entry
fee.  Two of the intruders were Gary Eunick, who was seen wearing an orange
vest, and his brother, both of whom were known by multiple witnesses at the
club.  The intruders pushed their way into the lobby of the club.  When Collin
and Roger intervened, a fight broke out in which beer bottles were broken and
the glass door of the club was smashed.  

[6]                             
Following the fight in the lobby, Collin and
Roger retreated to the nightclub’s kitchen.  The intruders exited the club, at
which point Mr. Eunick was seen fidgeting with a gun in the parking lot. 
Minutes later, he and two of the other intruders, one wearing a blue/green
shirt, returned to the nightclub.  Mr. Eunick was armed with a semi-automatic
handgun and the man in the blue/green shirt carried a long barrel revolver. 
Mr. Eunick and the man in the blue/green shirt entered the kitchen, where they
shot Collin eight times, killing him.  They also shot at Roger, who was grazed
by a bullet and only slightly wounded.  

[7]                             
The owner of the nightclub saw Mr. Eunick
leaving the club in a green Honda and recorded the licence plate number.  The
car was registered to Lydia Hay, who resided at 6927 Chigwel Court, with her
daughter Lisa Hay, who was Gary Eunick’s girlfriend, and her son Leighton Hay,
the appellant.  The police arrived at the Chigwel residence within
approximately half an hour of the shooting, where they found the green Honda in
the driveway.  They surveilled the residence for approximately the next 10 hours.

[8]                             
While the police were surveilling the home, several
witnesses from the nightclub were shown photo lineups at the police station. 
Multiple witnesses were able to confidently identify Gary Eunick as the shooter
in an orange vest with the semi-automatic gun.  Given Mr. Hay’s connection to
the Chigwel residence and a database lookup that revealed he had a prior
firearm conviction, the police considered him a suspect.  Leisa Maillard, an
acquaintance of Collin Moore who was in the kitchen at the time the intruders
entered to shoot him, was shown a lineup containing a photo of Mr. Hay.  When
asked about the identity of the shooter in the blue/green shirt, she selected
Mr. Hay’s photo.  The details of that selection are discussed in more detail
later.  

[9]                             
Neither party proffered evidence as to whether
Mr. Hay’s photo was included in the lineups shown to witnesses other than Ms.
Maillard.  

[10]                         
At approximately noon, following the shooting,
Lisa Hay, Mr. Hay’s sister, emerged from the Chigwel residence and appeared as
though she was prepared to clean the green Honda.  At this point, the police
moved in, secured the residence, and arrested Gary Eunick and Leighton Hay. 
The men were subsequently charged with the first degree murder of Collin Moore
and the attempted murder of Roger Moore.

III.   
Procedural History

A.      
Trial Proceedings

[11]                         
Mr. Eunick and Mr. Hay were tried together on
both counts.  The Crown’s theory at trial was that Mr. Eunick and Mr. Hay were
the two men who entered the kitchen and shot at the Moore brothers. 

[12]                         
The identity of Mr. Eunick as one of the
shooters was never in serious doubt.  Mr. Eunick was identified by multiple
witnesses at the nightclub, including Collin Moore’s wife, who knew him, and
the club owner, who named him during his initial 911 call that night.  The
physical evidence connecting Mr. Eunick to the shooting was also overwhelming. 
The Crown introduced evidence of a palm print and blood found on the front door
of the nightclub that matched Mr. Eunick.  It also introduced evidence of
several items found scattered around the Chigwel residence that implicated Mr.
Eunick, including:  a shopping bag recovered from the back of the house
containing the orange vest he wore at the club, which had Mr. Eunick’s blood
and gunshot granules on it; a backpack containing a white T-shirt and blue
jeans, which had Mr. Eunick’s blood and gunshot residue on them; shoes in Lisa
Hay’s closet, which had glass shards in the treads from the broken door at the
club; bullets found in a sock in a hamper at the entrance to Mr. Hay’s bedroom,
one of which may have been cycled through (i.e. was at some point loaded in the
chamber of the semi-automatic handgun fired by Mr. Eunick); and Mr. Eunick’s
blood in the front passenger area of the Honda Civic.  

[13]                         
The Crown’s theory was that Mr. Hay was the
second shooter ― the man with the long barrel revolver wearing a
blue/green shirt.  Mr. Hay’s defence was that he never went to the club with
Mr. Eunick that night and was instead at home sleeping during the relevant
period.  

[14]                         
The Crown’s case against Mr. Hay consisted of
testimony from Ms. Maillard and four pieces of physical evidence: (1) the
aforementioned bullets in a sock, which were found in a laundry hamper at the
entrance of Mr. Hay’s bedroom; (2) a white T-shirt, which contained a particle
of gunshot residue, found in the same hamper; (3) hair clippings found in a
newspaper in the bathroom garbage; and (4) hair clippings found in an electric
razor in Mr. Hay’s nightstand.  An understanding of the relevance of each piece
of evidence and the overall strength of the Crown’s case is necessary to
evaluate Mr. Hay’s arguments on appeal. 

(1)     
Ms. Maillard’s Eyewitness Evidence

[15]                         
Ms. Maillard was the only eyewitness who
implicated Mr. Hay as one of the shooters.  She testified that she was in the
kitchen when the two shooters entered and that she focused her attention on the
shooter who was wearing the blue/green plaid button-up shirt with a white
T-shirt underneath and who carried a long barrel revolver.  She described him
as having two-inch long “picky” dreadlocks: A.R., vol. II, at p. 832.  According
to her testimony, she said to the shooter: “You don’t have to do this, you
know.  If you guys want to fight, just fight.  He has a wife and kids” (p. 835). 
At that point, the man turned to her, pointed his gun, and said, “Shut your
blood clot before I kill you” (ibid.).  Ms. Maillard continued to
focus on the man in the blue/green shirt, who moved further into the kitchen
and began firing at the Moore brothers.  After the fourth shot, she left the
kitchen and hid in the hallway.

[16]                         
As mentioned above, following the shooting, the
police suspected that Mr. Hay might be the second shooter and included his
picture in a photo lineup shown to Ms. Maillard.  The evidence at trial
established that the lineup contained 12 photos, one photo of Mr. Hay that was
taken roughly two years earlier and 11 photos depicting men with similar
features.

[17]                         
 Detective Derek Young provided Ms. Maillard
with a series of cautions before showing her the photo lineup.  In particular,
he informed her that he would be showing her a page with 12 photos on it that
may or may not include a photo of the suspect.  He informed her that she should
go through each of the 12 photos before selecting anyone and that she should
not rely heavily on facial features that might change.  He told her that if she
was able to identify the shooter with 100 percent positivity, she should say
so, and if not, she should provide a percentage on the likelihood that the
person she has selected was the suspect.

[18]                         
Det. Young’s and Ms. Maillard’s testimony
established that Ms. Maillard looked at each photo in the lineup and that when
she reached the photo depicting Mr. Hay, she became shaken up.  She pointed at
the photo and stated: “Out of all of these pictures this gentleman most fits
the description of the gentlemen I saw shooting”: A.R., vol. III, at p. 999. 
She stated to the investigating officer that in her belief, the photo of Mr.
Hay depicted the shooter in the blue/green shirt and on “a percentage scale I
would probably say maybe 80 percent” (pp. 979-80).  Det. Young then sought to
clarify her statement with the following exchange:

[Det. Young:]      Are you saying that this photograph depicts the
likeness about 80 percent of the person?

 

. . .

 

[Ms. Maillard:]     That’s
correct.

 

. . .

 

[Det. Young:]      That did
the shooting?

 

. . .

 

[Ms. Maillard:]     That’s
correct.

 

. . .

 

[Det. Young:]      But are you saying this is the person that did
the shooting?  I have to have a yes or no.

 

. . .

 

[Ms. Maillard:]     No, the photograph is about 80 percent . . . of
what depicts the likeness of the person that did the shooting. 

 

. . .

 

[Det. Young:]      Okay. 

 

. . .

 

[Ms. Maillard:]     I wish I could. [A.R., vol. III, at pp. 1014-16]

[19]                         
At trial, Ms. Maillard took the position that
she did intend to identify Mr. Hay as the shooter in the blue/green shirt.  She
explained her comment that the photo shared 80 percent of the likeness of the
shooter as follows:

I meant that
the photograph being a photocopy, about not being able to pick up the facial
hair, not being able to see, you know, knowing that it might not be a current
photograph of him, noting that his hair might be different, taking into account
all those factors that I was told and being — seeing someone get shot and
knowing that this is something very important that I was doing, picking
somebody, you know, out of a line-up that was responsible for a man dying, I
was being cautious.  [A.R., vol. II, at pp. 856-57]

[20]                         
According to Ms. Maillard’s testimony, a day or
two after the shooting, she called the police station “to find out whether or
not [her] I.D. was pretty much the right person or not”: A.R., vol. II, at pp.
893-94. 

[21]                         
Three weeks after the shooting, Ms. Maillard
participated in a second photo lineup, in which she was shown a number of
photographs in sequence and asked if any matched the shooter in the blue/green
shirt.  The photo sequence contained the photo of Mr. Hay taken on the day of
his arrest, following the shooting.  However, Ms. Maillard did not select any
photo from the sequence.  Ms. Maillard testified at trial that she just
“flipped through” the photos and stated that the arrest photo did not have a
gaunt face, as she had recalled the shooter at the club: A.R., vol. II, at p.
895. 

[22]                         
Finally, defence counsel elicited testimony from
Ms. Maillard that at the preliminary inquiry, she repeatedly identified Mr.
Eunick, not Mr. Hay, as the shooter in the blue/green shirt.  Ms. Maillard
testified that she erroneously pointed out Mr. Eunick because she was nervous
and scared, and because Mr. Hay had bulked up since the shooting.  

[23]                         
Ms. Maillard was not asked at trial if she could
make an in-court identification of Mr. Hay.  

(2)     
Physical Evidence:  Bullets, White T-Shirt and
Hair Clippings 

[24]                         
As mentioned above, the Crown introduced the
following physical evidence implicating Mr. Hay: (1) bullets found in a sock in
a laundry hamper in his bedroom, one of which may have been cycled through the
semi-automatic handgun fired by Mr. Eunick; (2) a white T-shirt in the same
hamper with one granule of gunshot residue on it; (3) hair clippings from a
newspaper in the garbage of the bathroom nearest to Mr. Hay’s bedroom; and (4)
hair clippings in an electric razor found in Mr. Hay’s nightstand.  

[25]                         
The bullets and white T-shirt implicated Mr. Hay
in the crime based on the location in which they were found ― the hamper
in his bedroom ― and the expert testimony associating them with the
shooting.  With respect to the bullets, the Crown’s firearms expert testified that
one of the unfired bullets found in the sock had been cycled through the
semi-automatic gun used by Mr. Eunick in the shooting.  Mr. Hay’s firearm
expert did not dispute the methodology or assumptions made by the Crown expert,
but testified that he was unable to reach the same conclusion.  It was
undisputed that if the bullets in the sock had any connection to the shooting,
it was to the semi-automatic gun fired by Mr. Eunick and not the long barrel
revolver used by the shooter in the blue/green shirt. 

[26]                         
The white T-shirt was tied to the shooting by
virtue of the eyewitness testimony that the shooter in the blue/green shirt was
wearing a white T-shirt underneath and the fact that the T-shirt was found on
the top of Mr. Hay’s laundry hamper with one speck of gunshot residue on it. 
The Crown’s theory was that Mr. Hay put the bullets and his white T-shirt in
the hamper upon returning home from the shooting.  

[27]                         
The defence argued that Mr. Eunick, who had
testified that he used the bathroom next to Mr. Hay’s bedroom upon returning
from the club, placed the bullets in Mr. Hay’s hamper, which was located just
inside the entrance to the bedroom.  In the process of doing so, Mr. Eunick
contaminated the white T-shirt on the top of the hamper with a single granule
of gunshot residue.  According to the defence, this was supported by the fact
that there was no gunshot residue found on any of the other items in the
hamper.  

[28]                         
The other physical evidence introduced by the
Crown was hair clippings obtained from two places: (1) a crumpled page of
newspaper dated three weeks earlier found in the waste basket in the bathroom
near Mr. Hay’s bedroom and (2) an electric razor found in the nightstand next
to Mr. Hay’s bed.  The evidence established that the hairs in the newspaper and
the razor were less than a centimeter long.  The hair was not submitted to a
forensic expert for trial and no expert testified regarding the hair.  

[29]                         
The Crown’s theory with respect to the hair
clippings was that Mr. Hay shaved his head upon returning home from the shooting. 
This was necessary to explain the discrepancy between the eyewitness testimony
― which indicated that the second shooter had dreadlocks that were two
inches or longer ― and the length of Mr. Hay’s hair when he was arrested
― which was very short.  It was also used to explain why Ms. Maillard was
not able to identify Mr. Hay based on the arrest photo shown to her three weeks
after the shooting.  The Crown also suggested that the haircut represented an
after-the-fact attempt by Mr. Hay to change his appearance to cover up his
involvement in the shooting.  

[30]                         
In addition to this physical evidence, the Crown
also introduced a videotape of the Chigwel Court residence recorded after Mr.
Eunick and Mr. Hay were arrested.  One scene in the video depicts a blue shirt
draped on a bunk bed in a second bedroom in the home.  However, the record does
not indicate that the Crown ever sought to seize the shirt, let alone submit it
for testing or present it to one of the eyewitnesses to make the case that it
was the blue/green shirt worn by the second shooter.  

(3)     
Jury Verdict

[31]                         
Based on the evidence described above, the jury
found Mr. Eunick and Mr. Hay guilty of first degree murder of Collin Moore and
attempted murder of Roger Moore.  

B.      
Ontario Court of Appeal, 2009 ONCA 398, 249 O.A.C. 24

[32]                         
In the Court of Appeal, Mr. Hay challenged his
conviction on the bases that the jury’s verdict was unreasonable and that the
trial judge erred in instructing the jury on eyewitness identification. 
Moldaver J.A., as he then was, wrote for a unanimous panel and dismissed the
appeal.  

[33]                         
The court held that the jury’s verdict was not
unreasonable because, despite weaknesses in Ms. Maillard’s eyewitness
testimony, there was other confirmatory evidence presented to the jury,
including the bullets and shirt found in Mr. Hay’s hamper and the hair
clippings, which allowed for the “powerful inference” that Mr. Hay shaved his
head after the murder to disguise his appearance (para. 36).  The court
acknowledged that the jury could have drawn multiple inferences from the
evidence presented, but concluded that this confirmatory evidence “put this
case over the unreasonable verdict threshold” (ibid.). 

[34]                         
With respect to the trial judge’s instruction to
the jury on eyewitness identification, Mr. Hay raised three arguments.  First,
he argued that the trial judge erroneously instructed the jury that it could
convict Mr. Hay on the evidence of Ms. Maillard alone.  The Court of Appeal
disagreed.  In its view, the trial judge did not instruct the jury that it
could convict on Ms. Maillard’s testimony alone.  Rather, the trial judge
instructed the jury that it must look to confirmatory evidence. 

[35]                         
Mr. Hay raised two other challenges regarding
the trial judge’s instruction on eyewitness evidence and challenged the trial
judge’s instruction on the planning and deliberation requirement for first degree
murder.  These challenges were rejected by the Court of Appeal and have not
been reargued before this Court.  

C.      
Motion for an Order to Release Exhibits 

[36]                         
While the application for leave to appeal was
pending before this Court, Mr. Hay filed a motion to compel the Crown to
release two pieces of evidence for forensic testing:  the hair clippings found
in the crumpled newspaper and the hair clippings found in the electric razor. 
Mr. Hay sought to forensically examine the hair clippings to determine from
what part of the body the clippings came.  This Court allowed the motion; see R.
v. Hay, 2010 SCC 54, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 206, at para. 10.  However, it
deferred consideration of any motion to adduce fresh evidence to be considered
with the appeal (para. 9).  

[37]                         
On December 1, 2010, the parties submitted a
proposed protocol for releasing the hair clippings and having them examined by
the Centre of Forensic Sciences.  This Court ordered that the hairs be released
and examined in accordance with that protocol.  Mr. Hay subsequently filed a
motion under s. 683  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , to
adduce the reports and testimony of experts who conducted the forensic
examination.

IV.       Issues

[38]                         
This appeal presents two issues:

(1)        Whether the trial judge erred by instructing the jury
that it could convict Mr. Hay based on Ms. Maillard’s eyewitness evidence
alone. 

(2)        Whether Mr. Hay’s motion to adduce fresh evidence should
be granted and if so, what is the appropriate remedy? 

V.      
Analysis

A.      
Jury Charge Regarding Eyewitness Testimony

[39]                         
Mr. Hay argues that the trial judge erred by
instructing the jury that it could convict him on Ms. Maillard’s eyewitness
testimony alone.  Like the Court of Appeal, I am of the view that Mr. Hay’s
argument should be rejected.  As I explain below, it would have been an error
to instruct the jury that it could convict Mr. Hay based on Ms. Maillard’s
testimony alone because it was too weak to establish Mr. Hay’s guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt.  However, read as a whole, the trial judge’s jury charge did
not instruct the jury that it could convict based on Ms. Maillard’s testimony
alone.  Rather, it instructed the jury that it must look to confirmatory
evidence.  It is not disputed that Ms. Maillard’s testimony in conjunction with
the confirmatory evidence was sufficient to support the conclusion that Mr. Hay
was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and, thus, there was no error in the jury
charge. 

(1)      Whether It Would Have Been an Error to Instruct the Jury That It
Could Convict Mr. Hay Based on Ms. Maillard’s Testimony Alone

[40]                         
The credibility and weight that should be given
to eyewitness testimony is an issue committed to the ultimate trier of fact
― here, the jury: R. v. Mezzo, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 802, at pp.
844-45.  It is well established that where the Crown relies on an eyewitness
identification, the trial judge has a duty to caution the jury regarding the
well-recognized frailties of identification evidence; see Mezzo, at p.
845, citing R. v. Turnbull, [1976] 3 All E.R. 549 (C.A.); R. v.
Hibbert, 2002 SCC 39, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 445, at paras. 78-79 (per Bastarache
J., dissenting, although not on this point); R. v. Canning, [1986] 1
S.C.R. 991.  However, a properly instructed jury may conclude, notwithstanding
the frailties of eyewitness identification, that the eyewitness’ testimony is
reliable and may enter a conviction on those grounds.  This may be so even
where the Crown has relied on only a single eyewitness; see Mezzo, at p.
844; R. v. Nikolovski, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 1197, at para. 23.

[41]                         
Although the duty to assess the credibility and
weight of an eyewitness’ evidence sits with the jury and, in some
circumstances, the testimony of one eyewitness will support a conviction, the
jury should not be permitted to convict on the basis of eyewitness testimony
that could not support an inference of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  In other
words, a jury should not be instructed that it may convict based on eyewitness
testimony alone where that testimony, even if believed, would necessarily leave
reasonable doubt in the mind of a reasonable juror; see R. v. Arcuri,
2001 SCC 54, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 828, at paras. 21-25; R. v. Reitsma, [1998]
1 S.C.R. 769, rev’g (1997), 97 B.C.A.C. 303; R. v. Zurowski, 2004 SCC
72, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 509; United States of America v. Shephard, [1977] 2
S.C.R. 1067, at p. 1080.  Indeed, where the Crown’s case consists solely of
eyewitness testimony that would necessarily leave reasonable doubt in the mind
of a reasonable juror, the trial judge must direct an acquittal upon a motion
for directed verdict (Arcuri, at para. 21).  

[42]                         
In my view, it would have been unreasonable for
the jury to convict Mr. Hay based solely on Ms. Maillard’s eyewitness
testimony.  In addition to the usual frailties associated with eyewitness
identification and photo lineups, the evidence at trial established several other
problems with Ms. Maillard’s ability to identify Mr. Hay as the shooter.  As
described above, Ms. Maillard’s initial selection of Mr. Hay from the photo
lineup was accompanied by a statement that she was not identifying him as the
shooter, but as someone who shared 80 percent of the likeness of the shooter. 
Furthermore, within a couple of days of the shooting, Ms. Maillard called the
police to confirm whether the person she had selected was “pretty much the
right person or not”: A.R., vol. II, at pp. 893-94.  Also, the evidence
established that three weeks after the shooting Ms. Maillard was not able to
select Mr. Hay as the shooter based on his arrest photo taken the day of the
crime and that, at the preliminary inquiry, Ms. Maillard repeatedly identified
Mr. Eunick, not Mr. Hay, as the shooter in the blue/green shirt.  Each of these
events raised some doubt as to Ms. Maillard’s ability to identify Mr. Hay as
the second shooter.

[43]                         
To be sure, the Crown did adduce evidence to
address some of the problems with Ms. Maillard’s testimony.  It elicited
testimony from Ms. Maillard that, despite her statements to the contrary when
she selected Mr. Hay’s photo on the morning of the shootings, she did
intend to identify Mr. Hay as the shooter.  Furthermore, the Crown introduced
hair clippings found in Mr. Hay’s bathroom and electric razor to explain that
Ms. Maillard was unable to identify Mr. Hay based on his arrest photo because
he had cut his hair.  

[44]                         
In my view, however, this evidence does not
support the conclusion that Ms. Maillard’s testimony, on its own, provided a
basis for conviction.  Ms. Maillard’s testimony that she intended to identify
Mr. Hay as the shooter could not erase the reasonable doubt created by her
confirmation at the time of the photo lineup that she could not identify him as
the shooter and by her inability to identify Mr. Hay at the subsequent photo
lineup and at the preliminary inquiry.  Furthermore, although the Crown’s
explanation that Mr. Hay cut his hair after the shooting gave the jury a basis
for reconciling Ms. Maillard’s difficulty in identifying Mr. Hay in the second
photo lineup, the explanation itself relied on confirmatory evidence ―
the hair clippings.  It thus does not change the fact that Ms. Maillard’s
testimony, in and of itself, would not have permitted a reasonable juror
to conclude without reasonable doubt that Mr. Hay was one of the shooters.  

[45]                         
For these reasons, in my view, it would have
been an error for the trial judge to instruct the jury that it could convict
Mr. Hay based solely on Ms. Maillard’s evidence.  Indeed, in this appeal, the
Crown has not attempted to argue otherwise.  The Crown has instead argued that
the trial judge made no error because he never instructed the jury that it
could have convicted Mr. Hay based on Ms. Maillard’s testimony alone.  I turn
to that argument next. 

(2)     
Whether the Trial Judge Erred in Instructing the
Jury 

[46]                         
In my view, the Court of Appeal correctly held
that the trial judge made no error in instructing the jury regarding Ms.
Maillard’s eyewitness testimony. 

[47]                         
When reviewing a jury charge, “[a]n appellate
court must examine the alleged error in the context of the entire charge and of
the trial as a whole”:  R. v. Jaw, 2009 SCC 42, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 26, at
para. 32.  Where an impugned reference in a jury charge in isolation could be
understood to be an incorrect statement of the law, an appeal court will not
interfere if it is evident that, considering the charge as a whole, the jury
would have been properly instructed: ibid., at paras. 3 and 24.  

[48]                         
Furthermore, although appeal courts will
interfere when a jury has not been adequately instructed, a trial judge must be
afforded a certain degree of flexibility in instructing the jury; see R. v.
Avetysan, 2000 SCC 56, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 745, at para. 9.  A trial judge is
not required to use “any particular form of words” in instructing the jury
regarding the frailties of eyewitness evidence and, rather, must be afforded
considerable latitude in deciding how best to apprise the jurors about those
frailties: Turnbull, at p. 552; R. v. Candir, 2009 ONCA 915,
257 O.A.C. 119, at para. 110.  

[49]                         
In the present case the trial judge made the
following general remarks about the reliability of eyewitness evidence, prior
to revisiting in detail the evidence against Mr. Eunick and Mr. Hay: 

There
has been eyewitness testimony from a number of witnesses.  You must be very
cautious about relying on eyewitness testimony to find either of the two
accused persons guilty.  That caution is required because experience has taught
us that all identification evidence suffers from an inherent frailty.  Human
observations and recollections are notoriously unreliable in this area.

 

Indeed,
many cases of miscarriage of justice have been due to mistaken identification
by one or more responsible witnesses whose honesty was not challenged and who
had ample opportunity for observation, but whose identifications subsequently
proved to be erroneous.

 

You
may have no doubt that a witness or witnesses are certain in their own minds
that they observed and recognized the proper identifying characteristics, but a
convincing witness, who is perfectly honest, may also be mistaken.  A person
can be sure in his or her own mind about an identification and yet be
mistaken.  In that context, you must bear in mind the distinction between
credibility or truthfulness, as opposed to reliability or accuracy.

 

So
I repeat, ladies and gentlemen, you must be very cautious about relying on
eyewitness testimony alone to find either of the defendants guilty of any
crime.  In the past, there have been miscarriages of justice. Persons have been
wrongly convicted because eyewitnesses have made mistakes in identifying the
persons whom they saw committing the crime.

 

As
a result, you should look for confirmatory evidence to support the eyewitness
identification evidence.  If you find other evidence to support the eyewitness
identification evidence, you may decide that the frailties associated with a
conviction based only on identification evidence has been discounted.  It will
be up to you.

 

But
even if you find no confirmatory evidence ― even though you are to
exercise caution because of the frailties of eyewitness identification evidence
― you are, nevertheless, entitled to convict on the evidence of even a
single eyewitness if you accept that witness’ identification and find that it
proves guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  But you should exercise real caution
before convicting on this type of evidence alone. [Emphasis added; A.R., vol. V, at pp. 2145-46.]

Mr. Hay contends that the
last paragraph of this excerpt would have left the jury with the understanding
that it could have convicted him based on Ms. Maillard’s testimony alone.  

[50]                         
Taken in isolation, the statement that the jury
was “entitled to convict on the evidence of even a single eyewitness” may
appear to do that.  However, I agree with the Court of Appeal that such an
interpretation of the trial judge’s instruction is belied when the full context
of the jury charge is considered.  

[51]                         
As the Court of Appeal observed, the impugned
instruction was, as a general matter, a correct statement of the law.  As mentioned
above, a jury may convict on the basis of a single eyewitness’ testimony,
notwithstanding the frailties of eyewitness identifications, if the witness’
testimony could support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. 

[52]                         
Furthermore, the impugned instruction was made
in the context of general instructions that applied to both Mr. Hay and his
co-defendant, Mr. Eunick.  With respect to Mr. Eunick, there were multiple
witnesses whose testimony could have supported a finding of guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt.  Witnesses Jennifer Moore and Hugh Robinson, for instance,
were both able to recognize Mr. Eunick from their past dealings and identify
him as one of the shooters during and immediately after the shooting. 

[53]                         
After the general instruction excerpted above,
the trial judge provided additional cautions regarding the frailties of
eyewitness testimony and then reviewed the evidence against each defendant. 
The trial judge’s instruction regarding the evidence against Mr. Hay did not
convey to the jury that it could convict Mr. Hay based solely on Ms. Maillard’s
testimony.  Rather, in reviewing Ms. Maillard’s testimony, the trial judge
described each of the specific problems with her identification, including her
inability to identify Mr. Hay at the second, sequential photo lineup ―
which he described as “a better way of showing photographs” than the first
photo lineup (A.R., vol. V, at p. 2178) ― and Ms. Maillard’s
misidentification at the preliminary inquiry.  After reviewing these problems
the trial judge stated:

You must be
very careful of the evidence of Ms Maillard because of the problems that I have
pointed out.  You should look for other evidence confirming her
identification. [Emphasis added; A.R., vol. V, at p. 2181.]

In addition, the trial
judge distinguished Ms. Maillard’s eyewitness account from the stronger
eyewitness evidence against Mr. Eunick: 

In the case
of Leisa Maillard, unlike Hugh Robinson and Jennifer Moore, she had never seen
the person she picked out of the lineup ― Leighton Hay ― before. 
Her evidence must, therefore, be approached with greater caution.  [A.R., vol.
V, at p. 2186]

[54]                         
I agree with the Court of Appeal that “[i]n the
face of those instructions, it is fanciful to think that the jury would have
convicted Hay solely on the eye-witness testimony of Ms. Maillard” (para. 48). 
Mr. Hay’s argument boils down to a contention that the trial judge was required
to say words such as “you may not convict Mr. Hay based on Leisa Maillard’s
testimony alone”.  However, the trial judge was not circumscribed to instruct
the jury as to the sufficiency of Ms. Maillard’s testimony using those
particular words.  He had a duty to “convey to the jury as trier of fact the
relevant legal principles and how they apply to the evidence adduced at trial”,
and he must be afforded some latitude in determining the best way to do so:  R.
v. Pickton, 2010 SCC 32, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 198, at para. 61.  A reasonable
juror instructed in the manner described above would not have interpreted the
impugned statement as an instruction that the jury could render a conviction
based solely on Ms. Maillard’s testimony; see Jaw, at para. 24.  

[55]                         
The record establishes that the trial judge put
great care into his jury charge and, in particular, into the instructions as to
eyewitness evidence.  The trial judge, for instance, gave a mid-trial
instruction to the jury regarding the frailties of eyewitness testimony
immediately after Ms. Maillard testified, in which he reiterated the problems
with her evidence.  At that time, he gave both parties an opportunity to object
and make submissions requesting additional instructions, but neither counsel
did so.  Furthermore, prior to instructing the jury at the end of the trial,
the judge held a pre-charge hearing, in which he accepted submissions on the
instructions relating to eyewitness testimony.  During that hearing, counsel
for the Crown and both defendants were all asked to consider the paragraph Mr.
Hay now impugns, and all counsel expressed satisfaction with its language. 
Counsel for Mr. Hay made several submissions regarding the problems with Ms.
Maillard’s identification, each of which the trial judge made note of and
subsequently included in his instructions to the jury.  At no time during any
of these hearings did any party express the view that the trial judge’s
instruction would convey to the jury that it could convict based on Ms.
Maillard’s testimony alone.  

[56]                         
For these reasons, I am of the view that the
trial judge did not err in instructing the jury and would dismiss this ground
of appeal. 

B.      
Motion to Adduce Fresh Evidence

[57]                         
As mentioned above, Mr. Hay has filed a motion
to adduce expert evidence regarding the forensic testing of the hair clippings
that the Crown introduced at trial.  Mr. Hay argues that the fresh evidence
establishes that the hair clippings did not come from a shave of Mr. Hay’s
scalp and that, as a result, acquittal or a new trial is warranted.  I explain
below that the motion to adduce fresh evidence should be granted and a new trial
should be ordered.  

(1)     
The Fresh Evidence

[58]                         
Mr. Hay’s fresh evidence consists of affidavits
and cross-examinations of two forensic experts, in which each expert provides
an opinion as to the percentage of hairs in the newspaper and the razor that
came from Mr. Hay’s scalp, as opposed to his face or trunk.  

[59]                         
Johanne Almer, a scientist at the Centre of
Forensic Sciences, examined the hairs introduced at trial.  In her initial
report, she concluded, based on an examination of the diameter and shape of the
individual hairs, that 68 percent of the hairs in the newspaper and 48 percent
of the hairs in the razor were indicative of facial or trunk origin.  The
remaining hairs could have been facial, trunk or scalp hair. 

[60]                         
Scientist Richard Bisbing, a second expert,
endorsed the methodology used by Ms. Almer.  After examining the hairs and Ms.
Almer’s work, he concluded that “the samples from the two items are
predominantly comprised of facial hairs” and that “[a]lthough the presence of
some scalp hairs cannot be excluded, there is no indication of a large number
of scalp hairs in either sample”: Application Record, vol. I, Tab D, at p. 3.

[61]                         
Mr. Bisbing recommended that a representative
scalp hair be obtained from Mr. Hay to improve the accuracy of the testing.  The
Crown consented.  After a representative scalp hair was obtained, Ms. Almer
conducted further examination and produced a second report affirming her
earlier conclusions.  She reported that if a particular outlier hair from Mr.
Hay’s scalp sample was excluded from her calculations, she would conclude that
at least 91 percent of the hairs from the newspaper and 70 percent of the hairs
from the razor did not originate from Mr. Hay’s scalp.  Mr. Bisbing also
conducted a second examination and agreed with Ms. Almer’s findings.  He
concluded: 

It can now be stated with a reasonable
degree of scientific certainty that the hairs from the clipper (Item 87) and
from the newspaper (Item 88) are populations of facial (beard) hair. Neither
sample contains a significant number of scalp (head) hairs to challenge this
conclusion.  [Application Record, vol. I, Tab E, at p. 3]

[62]                         
The Crown also hired two experts: David Exline,
a hair analyst, and Dr. Jeffrey Rosenthal, a professor of statistics.  Both
experts conducted a paper review of Ms. Almer’s and Mr. Bisbing’s reports
without personal examination of the hairs.  Much of the Crown experts’ analysis
focused on whether it was proper to exclude a hair obtained from Mr. Hay’s
scalp that Ms. Almer and Mr. Bisbing considered to be an outlier.  Both Mr.
Exline and Dr. Rosenthal testified that they would have included the outlier
hair.  However, both also testified that such inclusion would not have a
significant impact on the results and they would thus have reached conclusions
similar to Ms. Almer and Mr. Bisbing.  Consistent with Ms. Almer and Mr.
Bisbing, Mr. Exline testified that although he could not say with absolute
certainty that there were no scalp hairs among the hair clippings, there was,
as a scientific matter, no evidence to support the proposition that the hair
clippings represented a head shave.

(2)     
Whether the Motion to Adduce Fresh Evidence
Should Be Granted 

[63]                         
This Court considered the discretion of an
appellate court to admit fresh evidence under s. 610 of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, the predecessor of s. 683 , in Palmer.  The
overriding consideration upon a motion to adduce fresh evidence is “the
interests of justice”: Criminal Code, s. 683 ; Palmer,
at p. 775.  This requires consideration of the following principles: 

(1)   The evidence should generally not be admitted if, by due
diligence, it could have been adduced at trial provided that this general
principle will not be applied as strictly in a criminal case as in civil cases:
see McMartin v. The Queen, [1964] S.C.R. 484.

 

(2)   The evidence must be relevant in the sense that it bears upon
a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial.

 

(3)   The evidence must be credible in the sense that it is
reasonably capable of belief, and 

 

(4)   It must be such that if believed it could reasonably, when
taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected
the result. [p. 775]

Here, the Crown has
conceded that the expert evidence Mr. Hay seeks to adduce is credible and thus
satisfies the third factor.  As I explain below, the consideration of the
remaining factors leads to the conclusion that the fresh evidence should be
admitted. 

(a)      
Due Diligence

[64]                         
The due diligence criterion exists to ensure
finality and order — values essential to the integrity of the criminal process:
R. v. G.D.B., 2000 SCC 22, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 520, at para. 19 (citing R.
v. M. (P.S.) (1992), 77 C.C.C. (3d) 402 (Ont. C.A.), per Doherty
J.A., at p. 411).  The due diligence requirement calls for an appellate court
to consider the reason why the evidence was not presented at trial: G.D.B.,
at para. 20.  However, this Court has recognized that “due diligence is not an
essential requirement of the fresh evidence test, particularly in criminal
cases” and that the “criterion must yield where its rigid application might
lead to a miscarriage of justice” (para. 19).  Nonetheless, it is an important
factor to be considered in the totality of the circumstances (ibid.).

[65]                         
Here, Mr. Hay submits that the fresh evidence
was not adduced at trial because his trial counsel was unaware that it was
feasible to perform forensic testing to determine whether hair clippings
originate from an individual’s scalp or another part of the body.  Mr. Hay has
submitted an affidavit from his trial counsel to that effect. 

[66]                         
In his reasons granting the order to release the
two exhibits for forensic testing, Cromwell J. inferred from the evidence
before him that it simply did not occur to any of the experienced criminal
lawyers that forensic testing of this nature was feasible:

This sort of forensic testing was not
conducted by the Crown in preparation for trial and was not requested on behalf
of the defence until several months after the appeal to the Court of Appeal had
been dismissed.  Defence counsel at trial indicates in his affidavit that he
was unaware that forensic analysis could distinguish between scalp and facial
hairs.  There is a letter in the record indicating that the applicant’s counsel
on the appeal to the Court of Appeal was similarly unaware of the feasibility
of such testing.  There is no evidence that the Crown was aware of this
possibility.  Given that it appears that no one requested such testing and the
potential importance of the result which might be obtained, I would infer that
it simply did not occur to any of the experienced criminal lawyers involved
that this testing was available.  [para. 8]

The parties have not
provided any reason why this conclusion should be reconsidered. 

[67]                         
In general, mere lack of knowledge on the part
of trial counsel without any indication that he inquired into the possibility
of obtaining and presenting the evidence is a factor against admitting the
evidence for the first time on appeal: McMartin, at pp. 490-91. 
However, in view of the fact that this is a criminal case, involving charges of
the most serious nature, I would not allow the evidence to be excluded solely
on the basis of a lack of diligence.    

(b)     
Whether the Evidence Bears on a Decisive or Potentially
Decisive Issue

[68]                         
It cannot reasonably be disputed that Mr. Hay’s
fresh evidence bears on a decisive issue.  As described above, the hair
clippings from Mr. Hay’s waste basket and electric razor were used in two
ways.  First, they were used to explain the discrepancy between the
eyewitnesses’ description of the shooter as having dreadlocks and the short
length of Mr. Hay’s hair at the time of his arrest.  This was also how the Crown
explained Ms. Maillard’s inability to identify Mr. Hay based on his arrest
photo.  Second, the hair clippings were used to implicate Mr. Hay by suggesting
that he had cut his hair immediately after the shooting as evidence of an
after-the-fact attempt to change his appearance.  

[69]                         
The evidence was therefore directly relevant to
whether Mr. Hay was in fact the shooter in the blue/green shirt.  

(c)      
Whether the Evidence Could Reasonably Be
Expected to Have Affected the Result

[70]                         
The fresh evidence that Mr. Hay seeks to adduce
could reasonably be expected to have affected the jury’s verdict.  The import
of the hair clippings is evident from comments made by the trial judge and
Crown counsel, the jury charge and the Court of Appeal’s analysis, each of
which I describe below. 

[71]                         
Although the Crown has sought to downplay the
significance of the hair evidence in this appeal, it relied heavily on the
haircut evidence at trial.  In his closing address, for instance, Crown counsel
painted the following picture for the jury:

When
they came home, they convened at the back of the house. Mr. Hay took off his
shirt and they began to task divide. They took Eunick’s bloody clothes to wash
them. At some point, an old piece of newspaper was laid out, and Leighton
Hay's short, short dreads were shaved off, possibly by himself but more likely
by Mr. Eunick because he knows how to cut hair. They were then dumped into the
toilet. They were taken off, and only the small hairs that weighed the least
stuck to that newspaper, and he crumpled it up and threw it in the garbage, and
that’s where it was, right on top, the last thing put in. Everything else was
flushed. 

 

Mr.
House makes something of the date of that newspaper. If I understood his
submission, the last time Leighton Hay would have shaved was June 18th. But
he keeps his hair shears for shaving in his night table. He shaved his head
that night. He threw the short dreads down the toilet. He left just the small
clippings in that piece of newspaper. 

 

Mr.
House, if he suggested to you ― and I thought he did ― that they
were all over the newspaper, they weren’t; they were wrapped up inside it.
Detective Sergeant Tony Smith testified to that. And he threw them in the
garbage. And the reason was to alter his appearance. There wouldn’t be much point
in hiding clothes and bullets, and leaving hair in the waste bin. It was in the
toilet. [Emphasis added; A.R., vol. VI, at pp. 128-29.]

[72]                         
Further, in comments made during the trial in
the absence of the jury and witnesses, the trial judge recognized that if the
Crown could establish that Mr. Hay shaved his head in the morning following the
shootings, it would be “powerful evidence” of his “identity” as the shooter and
that “he did it to alter his appearance”: A.R., vol. II, at p. 928.

[73]                         
The significance of the hair clippings was also
reflected in the jury charge.  The trial judge instructed the jury that because
Mr. Hay had a shaved head at the time of his arrest, the jury “must consider
whether the evidence establishes that Leighton Hay shaved his head that night
after he got home”: A.R., vol. V, at p. 2153 (emphasis added).  He
instructed the jury that it must consider confirmatory evidence before relying
on Ms. Maillard’s eyewitness testimony, given the frailties of eyewitness
identifications and her inability to identify Mr. Hay at the second photo
lineup and the preliminary inquiry.  He repeated multiple times that the
Crown’s explanation for Ms. Maillard’s inability to identify Mr. Hay based on
his arrest photo hinged on proving that Mr. Hay had cut his hair after the
murder, for which the only evidence was the hair clippings. 

[74]                         
The Court of Appeal too recognized that the hair
clipping evidence was significant to the Crown’s case.  In concluding that the
jury’s verdict was not unreasonable, the Court of Appeal explained that the
hair clippings allowed for a “powerful inference” of guilt which was sufficient
to “tip the scales and put this case over the unreasonable verdict threshold” (para.
36).  Given the significance of the haircut to the Crown’s case, Mr. Hay’s
fresh evidence indicating that the hair clippings did not come from a scalp
shave could reasonably be expected to have affected the result. 

[75]                         
For these reasons, I would grant Mr. Hay’s
motion to adduce fresh evidence.   

(3)     
The Appropriate Remedy

[76]                         
Having concluded that Mr. Hay’s motion to adduce
fresh evidence should be granted, I turn to the appropriate remedy.  This Court
has explained that where an appeal court is of the view that fresh evidence
would be conclusive of the issues in the case, it should dispose of the matter
accordingly: R. v. Stolar, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 480, at p. 492.  However,
where the fresh evidence is not so decisive that it would allow an immediate
disposition of the matter, but it nonetheless has sufficient probative force
that, if accepted by the trier of fact, it might have altered the result of the
trial, an appeal court should admit the evidence and direct a new trial: ibid.;
Palmer, at pp. 776-77.

[77]                         
The appropriate remedy here is a new trial.  As
I have explained above, the expert evidence indicating that the hair clippings
did not result from a scalp shave could reasonably be expected to have affected
the verdict.  However, it is not so decisive as to allow an immediate
disposition in the form of an acquittal.  The Crown, in its submissions on the
motion to adduce fresh evidence, has raised the possibility of certain
limitations or gaps in the expert evidence adduced in this appeal.  The
interests of justice require that the Court remit the matter for a new trial,
in which the Crown would have the opportunity to adduce evidence challenging
the reliability of the fresh evidence. 

VI.       Conclusion

[78]                         
For the foregoing reasons, Mr. Hay’s motion to
adduce fresh evidence is granted and the appeal is allowed.  The matter is remanded
for retrial.

                    The following are the reasons
delivered by

                    Fish J. — 

I

[79]                         
Like Justice Rothstein, and for the reasons he
has given, I would grant the appellant’s motion to adduce fresh evidence and
order a new trial.

[80]                         
Our sole disagreement relates to the trial
judge’s charge concerning the evidence of Leisa Maillard.  Justice Rothstein
finds that the trial judge did not instruct the jury that it could convict the
appellant, Leighton Hay, on the evidence of Ms. Maillard alone.  With respect,
I believe that he did.  

[81]                         
As we shall see, the trial judge and counsel
evidently thought so too.  The jury can hardly have understood the judge’s
charge differently.

[82]                         
This error is in my view fatal, though the
judge’s charge was otherwise flawless and eminently fair.  And I think it right
to add that the law in this regard is more certain now than it was at the time
of trial.

II

[83]                         
Leighton Hay stands convicted of first degree
murder and attempted murder.  Leisa Maillard was the only eyewitness who
implicated Mr. Hay in the fatal shooting of the victim.  In a photo lineup
conducted by the police, Ms. Maillard said she was “about 80 percent” sure that
Mr. Hay was the shooter, but could not answer that question “yes or no”.  She
did not identify Mr. Hay in court.  Other significant frailties in her evidence
are well set out in the reasons of Justice Rothstein (notably at paras. 15-23
and, compendiously, at para. 42).

[84]                         
In his pre-charge submissions, Crown counsel
nonetheless asked the judge to instruct the jury that they could convict Mr.
Hay on the evidence of one eyewitness alone (A.R., vol. V, at pp. 2004, 2008
and 2011).  Counsel made clear that he was referring specifically to the
testimony of Ms. Maillard (pp. 2008 and 2014).  Indeed, he could hardly have
been referring to anyone else: As mentioned earlier, no other eyewitness
implicated Mr. Hay.

[85]                         
Quite properly, Crown counsel assured the trial
judge that he “want[ed] to be able to fashion [his] closing address to the jury
in a way that’s responsible and consistent with what you’re going to be
telling them” (A.R., vol. V, at p. 2014; unless otherwise indicated,
the emphasis throughout is mine).  The trial judge replied that he “[did not]
have a problem” with the Crown’s request and indicated that he would charge the
jury to that effect, though not necessarily in the wording proposed (pp. 2011
and 2014).

[86]                         
In his closing address, Crown counsel proceeded
on that understanding. This was apparent from the very outset:

I suspect
His Honour will also tell you, after considering the strength of eyewitness
testimony you’re entitled to convict on it alone if it persuades you,
beyond a reasonable doubt, that the person identified was the shooter.  [A.R.,
vol. VI, at p. 111]

[87]                         
The Crown then emphasized to the jury that this
principle applied to the testimony of Leisa Maillard:

The
lawyer [for Mr. Hay] has made much of the fact that [Ms. Maillard] said 80
percent.  She explained to you what she meant.  80 percent is of the picture,
because it may be an older picture. . . . If you accept her explanation —
there’s no reason not to — you can convict on the photo lineup and [her]
visceral reaction [to it] all alone.  If you’re troubled by it, then your
troubles will be wiped away by the overwhelming confirmatory evidence in this
case, which under Canadian law makes up for any frailties you might find in the
photo lineup. [A.R., vol. VI, at p. 117]

 

And again:

 

You
could, in this case, convict Leighton Hay on Leisa Maillard’s photo lineup . . . . [p. 119]

[88]                         
At no point in his charge did the able and
experienced trial judge correct these assertions by the Crown.  This confirms
to me, particularly in light of the pre-charge discussions, that they conformed
to the judge’s own understanding of the law.

[89]                         
Pursuant to the Crown’s closing argument, the
jury would thus have assumed that it was entitled to convict Mr. Hay based
solely on Ms. Maillard’s eyewitness “identification”.

[90]                         
Unfortunately, this misapprehension of the law
was soon to be reinforced by the trial judge in his own instructions to the
jury.

[91]                         
Early in his charge, the trial judge made clear
to the jury that “the main issue in this trial is the identity of the people
who murdered Collin Moore” (A.R., vol. V, at p. 2144).  He then explained the
dangers associated with reliance on eyewitness evidence to establish guilt. 
Then, in some measure echoing Crown counsel’s prior submission, he instructed
the jury as follows: 

. .
. you should look for confirmatory evidence to support the eyewitness
identification evidence.  If you find other evidence to support the eyewitness
identification evidence, you may decide that the frailties associated with a
conviction based only on identification evidence [have] been discounted.  It
will be up to you.

 

But
even if you find no confirmatory evidence — even
though you are to exercise caution because of the frailties of eyewitness
identification evidence — you are, nevertheless, entitled to convict on the
evidence of even a single eyewitness if you accept that witness’
identification and find that it proves guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. [A.R.,
vol. V, at p. 2146]

[92]                         
Thus, although the trial judge urged caution, he
informed the jury in unmistakable terms that the testimony of one eyewitness
could properly ground a conviction.  The jury would therefore have understood
that this rule applied unless instructed otherwise for a particular witness. 
No such instruction was ever given.

[93]                         
More particularly, the trial judge never told
the jury that his general instructions that I have just quoted did not apply to
the testimony of Leisa Maillard.  On the contrary, soon afterward, he explained
that identification evidence is stronger if the accused was previously known to
the witness.  And he related this instruction specifically to “the
evidence against Leighton Hay” (A.R., vol. V, at p. 2148).  This was
indisputably a direct reference to Ms. Maillard’s evidence implicating Mr. Hay.

[94]                         
In any event, there could be no confusion
regarding which defendant the trial judge was referring to when he instructed
the jury that it was “entitled to convict on the evidence of even a single
eyewitness” (A.R., vol. V, at p. 2146).  Several eyewitnesses identified Mr.
Hay’s co-accused, Gary Eunick, as one of the shooters.  Only Mr. Hay was
identified by “a single eyewitness” — Ms. Maillard (ibid.). 
Accordingly, the only meaningful application of this general instruction was in
regard to Ms. Maillard’s testimony.

[95]                         
The judge’s subsequent instructions regarding
Ms. Maillard’s evidence, if anything, reinforced Crown counsel’s uncorrected
statement to the jury that they could convict Mr. Hay on her photo
identification alone — and reinforced as well the judge’s own instruction to
the same effect (reproduced above at para. 91).

[96]                         
For example, in terms virtually identical to the
judge’s general caution regarding eyewitness identification evidence, he later
instructed the jury that it “should look for other evidence confirming
her identification” (A.R., vol. V, at p. 2181).  Manifestly, the term “should”
deprives this instruction of imperative force.  And, with respect, I am unable
to find in this or any other passage that the trial judge “instructed the jury
that it must look to confirmatory evidence” (my colleague’s reasons, at
para. 39).

[97]                         
Finally, near the very end of his charge, the
trial judge once again indicated to the jury that they could convict Mr. Hay on
the evidence of Ms. Maillard alone.  Without any suggestion that this was wrong
in law, the trial judge referred to Crown counsel’s submission that “just based
on Leisa Maillard’s evidence alone you should be sure that the shooter
was Leighton Hay” (A.R., vol. V, at p. 2245).

[98]                         
As mentioned at the outset and with the greatest
of respect, I am unable in light of this record to conclude that the trial
judge did not instruct the jury that it could convict Mr. Hay on the evidence
of Ms. Maillard alone.

III

[99]                         
The Court of Appeal held, at para. 48, that
“[i]n the face of [the jury] instructions, it is fanciful to think that the
jury would have convicted Hay solely on the eye-witness testimony of Ms.
Maillard.”  My colleague Justice Rothstein agrees (para. 54).

[100]                     
Though patently speculative and certainly
unverifiable, that may in fact be so.  In light of the trial judge’s effort to
make clear to the jury that it should be cautious before convicting Mr. Hay
based solely on Ms. Maillard’s identification, it does appear unlikely that the
jury convicted Mr. Hay without any regard to the confirmatory evidence. 
Whether that is the case, however, is a question that we are neither called
upon nor entitled to resolve.

[101]                     
Rather, the issue that concerns us here is
whether the trial judge erred in his instructions to the jury, and not with why
the jury decided as it did — a matter beyond our ken.

IV

[102]                     
As stated at the outset, I agree with Justice
Rothstein that the appellant’s motion to adduce fresh evidence should be
granted, that the appeal should be allowed and that a new trial should be
ordered.

on appeal from the court of appeal for british columbia

                    Criminal law — Sentencing — Sentencing procedure — Guilty
plea — Joint submission on sentence from Crown and defence counsel — Whether
trial judge erred in departing from joint submission — Proper legal test trial
judges should apply in deciding whether it is appropriate in a particular case
to depart from joint submission.

                    A‑C
attended a drop‑in centre which provided assistance to people suffering
from mental health and addiction problems. He had a long‑standing mental
health disorder and substance abuse issues. On February 9, 2013, A‑C
punched a regular volunteer at the drop‑in centre, G, who fell, hit his
head on the pavement, and died. A‑C was 28 years old and had a prior
criminal record. After his arrest, he was taken to a mental health facility.
Following his discharge, A‑C breached his bail conditions and was held in
custody thereafter until his sentencing hearing, a period of approximately
11 months. After several days of trial, A‑C pleaded guilty to manslaughter
for his role in the death of G. The Crown and the defence made a joint
submission on sentence, proposing a further 18 months in custody with no
period of probation to follow. The trial judge applied a “fitness test” to the
joint submission and rejected it. He concluded that an appropriate sentence was
two years less a day, factoring in deductions for pre‑sentence custody,
and added a three year probation order. The Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed A‑C’s sentence appeal on the basis
that the sentence imposed was fit in the circumstances.

                    Held: The appeal should be allowed and the sentence varied to bring it
into conformity with the joint submission.

                    Joint
submissions on sentence — that is, when Crown and defence counsel agree to
recommend a particular sentence to the trial judge, in exchange for the accused
entering a plea of guilty — are vitally important to the well‑being of
the criminal justice system, as well as the justice system at large. Generally,
such agreements are unexceptional and they are readily approved by trial judges
without any difficulty. Occasionally, however, a joint submission may appear to
be unduly lenient, or perhaps unduly harsh, and trial judges are not obliged to
go along with them (Criminal Code, s. 606(1.1) (b)(iii)). 

                    There
is a lack of consensus regarding the legal test trial judges should apply in
deciding whether it is appropriate in a particular case to depart from a joint
submission. There are four possible approaches: the
fitness test; the demonstrably unfit test; the public interest test; and, the
approach that treats the fitness and public interest tests as essentially the
same. The public interest test is the proper legal test that trial
judges should apply. Under the public interest test, a trial judge should not
depart from a joint submission on sentence unless the proposed sentence would bring
the administration of justice into disrepute or would otherwise be contrary to
the public interest. For joint submissions to be possible, the parties must
have a high degree of confidence that they will be accepted. The public interest test, by being more stringent than the other tests proposed, best reflects
the many benefits that joint submissions bring to the criminal justice system
and the corresponding need for a high degree of certainty in them. 

                    Crown
and defence counsel are well placed to arrive at a joint submission that
addresses the interests of both the public and the accused. Trial judges should
not reject a joint submission lightly. They should only do so where the
proposed sentence would be viewed by reasonable and informed persons as a
breakdown in the proper functioning of the justice system. A lower threshold
than this would cast the efficacy of resolution agreements into too great a
degree of uncertainty. 

                    Where
the joint submission is contentious and raises concerns with the trial judge,
the following procedures should be followed. First, the trial judge should
approach the joint submission on an “as‑is” basis. Second, the
public interest test should be applied when a trial judge is considering going
above or below the sentence proposed in the joint submission, although
different considerations may inform the public interest in each context. Third,
the trial judge may inquire about the circumstances leading to the joint
submission — and, in particular, any benefits obtained by the Crown or
concessions made by the accused. Fourth, the trial judge should notify counsel
of any concerns and invite further submissions on those concerns, including the
possibility of allowing the accused to withdraw his or her guilty plea. Fifth,
if the trial judge’s concerns are not alleviated, the judge may allow the
accused to withdraw his or her guilty plea. Finally, if the trial judge remains
unsatisfied by counsel’s submissions, he or she should provide clear and cogent
reasons for departing from the joint submission.

                    In
the present case, the trial judge applied the fitness test, a less stringent
test than he should have applied, and in doing so, he erred in principle. In
view of the trial judge’s error, deference is not owed. Applying the proper
legal test — the public interest test — the sentence proposed by the parties
did not, in the circumstances, warrant a departure from the joint submission.
Indeed, it was close to the range of sentence identified by the trial judge.
Moreover, A‑C gave up his right to a trial and any self‑defence
argument he may have had. In the end, the trial judge’s deviation from the
recommended custodial sentence — by only six months — amounts to little more
than tinkering. In addition, the probation order should not have been made.
Counsel’s view that the probation order was duplicative and therefore
unnecessary to protect the public was reasonable in the circumstances.

The judgment of the
Court was delivered by 

[1]                             
Moldaver J. — Resolution discussions between Crown and
defence counsel are not only commonplace in the criminal justice system, they
are essential.  Properly conducted, they permit the system to function smoothly
and efficiently.

[2]                             
Joint submissions on sentence — that is, when
Crown and defence counsel agree to recommend a particular sentence to the
judge, in exchange for the accused entering a plea of guilty — are a subset of
resolution discussions.[1] 
They are both an accepted and acceptable means of plea resolution.  They occur
every day in courtrooms across this country and they are vital to the efficient
operation of the criminal justice system.  As this Court said in R. v. Nixon,
2011 SCC 34, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 566, not only do joint submissions “help to
resolve the vast majority of criminal cases in Canada”, but “in doing so,
[they] contribute to a fair and efficient criminal justice system” (para. 47). 

[3]                             
But joint submissions on sentence are not
sacrosanct.  Trial judges may depart from them.  That is what happened here. 
The appellant, Mr. Anthony-Cook, entered a plea of guilty to manslaughter on
the basis of a joint submission as to sentence.  The trial judge rejected the
joint submission and imposed a longer custodial sentence than the sentence
proposed by Crown and defence counsel.  He also imposed a probation order for
three years, even though the joint submission did not contemplate a period of
probation.  

[4]                             
The narrow issue before us is whether the trial
judge erred in departing from the joint submission proposed by the parties. 
The broader issue concerns the legal test trial judges should apply in deciding
whether it is appropriate in a particular case to depart from a joint
submission.

[5]                             
For the reasons that follow, I am respectfully
of the view that the trial judge in the present case applied a less stringent
test than he should have in choosing to depart from the joint submission — and
in doing so, he erred in principle.  The test he applied was a “fitness of sentence”
test.  The test he should have applied is whether the proposed sentence would
bring the administration of justice into disrepute, or would otherwise be
contrary to the public interest. 

[6]                             
In view of the trial judge’s error, deference is
not owed and we can look at the matter afresh, using the correct test to
determine whether the joint submission on sentence should have been accepted. 
Applying that test, I am satisfied that the sentence proposed by the parties
did not, in the circumstances, warrant a departure from the joint submission. 
Accordingly, I would allow the appeal and vary the sentence to bring it into
conformity with the joint submission.

I.             
Facts

[7]                             
On June 16, 2014, the appellant entered a plea
of guilty to manslaughter for his role in the death of Michael Gregory.  The
facts underlying his plea are as simple as they are tragic.

[8]                             
The Kettle Friendship Society is a society in
Vancouver, British Columbia, that provides services to individuals with mental
health and addictions issues.  The appellant has a long history of such
problems and from time to time, he turned to the Society’s drop-in centre for
assistance.  So too did Mr. Gregory although, in his case, in addition to
receiving assistance, he acted as a volunteer.

[9]                             
On the morning of February 9, 2013, Mr. Gregory
attended the centre but left at around 10:30 a.m. because he was feeling ill. 
At about the same time, the appellant was in the centre’s computer room.  One
of the other attendees complained about him causing a disturbance.  Staff found
him swearing and punching at a board near a computer.  They told him to leave,
which he did.  On his way out, he shouted at the staff and appeared angry and
upset.

[10]                         
As the appellant walked away from the drop-in
centre, he saw Mr. Gregory crossing the street, heading away from him.  The
appellant called out to Mr. Gregory, shouting words to the effect that he would
“kick his head in”.

[11]                         
Mr. Gregory shouted back, telling the appellant
to “smarten up” or “dummy up”.  He then changed direction and after catching up
with the appellant, grabbed him by the shoulder and began pushing him.  The two
men pushed each other.  Mr. Gregory continued yelling, and the appellant threw
three or four punches, none of which connected.

[12]                         
Mr. Gregory then backed away from the appellant
with his hands raised.  The appellant moved forward and threw two more punches,
striking Mr. Gregory in and around the head and neck.  The first blow stunned
Mr. Gregory, and the second knocked him unconscious.  Mr. Gregory fell
backwards.  His skull fractured when it hit the pavement.  He never regained
consciousness, and was pronounced dead at the hospital.  All of the punches
occurred within a matter of 10 to 20 seconds.

[13]                         
After Mr. Gregory fell, the appellant fled.  He
was located and arrested by the police about five hours later.  He was released
without charge the following day but was detained at a mental health facility
pursuant to a Director’s warrant issued under the Mental Health Act,
R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 288.  He remained in detention at a mental health facility
for about two months, until April 4, 2013, when he was taken into police
custody and charged with manslaughter. 

[14]                         
Four days later, the appellant was released on
bail with conditions.  One condition required that he reside at a mental health
facility unless discharged by his physicians.  In early July 2013, after
spending three months in a facility, the appellant’s physicians discharged him
into the community.  However, on July 19, 2013, he was arrested for breaching
the curfew condition of his bail order and his bail was revoked.  He was held
in custody thereafter until his sentencing hearing in June 2014, a period of
approximately 11 months.

[15]                         
Initially, the appellant entered a plea of not
guilty to the charge of manslaughter.  He changed his plea to guilty after
several days of trial.  He did so following a resolution agreement with the
Crown, under which the appellant would serve a further 18 months in custody —
in addition to the period of about a year he had spent in pre-trial custody — with
no period of probation to follow.  In exchange, the appellant would plead
guilty to manslaughter, thereby giving up his right to a trial, and with it,
the possibility of raising the defence of self-defence.

[16]                         
The appellant was 28 years old at the time of
his plea.  He has a criminal record dating back to 2007.  It includes
convictions for breaking and entering, theft, mischief, and failing to comply
with probation orders.  His criminal record does not reflect a history of
violence, apart from one conviction involving a minor assault.  The appellant
also has long-standing mental health and drug use problems.  He suffers from a
refractory psychotic disorder (schizoaffective disorder).  While there is no
suggestion that drug use played a role in the present offence, it has been a
factor in some of his prior offences.

[17]                         
At the sentencing hearing, the trial judge put
the Crown and defence on notice that he had serious reservations about the
joint submission.  He asked for further submissions.  He also invited the appellant
to apply to withdraw his guilty plea, if he wished to do so.  The appellant
declined the trial judge’s invitation.

[18]                         
The trial judge expressed two concerns with the
joint submission.  First, he noted that counsel had mistakenly overestimated by
some six months the amount of credit to which the appellant was entitled for
time spent in pre-sentence custody.  Crown counsel acknowledged the error, but
stated that it did not alter his position on the joint submission and he
continued to seek a further custodial sentence of 18 months.

[19]                         
Second, the trial judge was concerned that
without a probation order, the sentence would not adequately protect the
public.  In particular, he considered it important that the appellant refrain
from using non-medically prescribed drugs.  Counsel informed the trial judge
that a probation order would not be appropriate for two reasons.  First, it
would be duplicative because the appellant remained certified under the Mental
Health Act, and he would be supervised by his treatment team while living
in the community.  If his psychosis worsened or he failed to take his
medications, a warrant could issue requiring that he be returned to the
hospital, where he would remain until his team felt he was suitable for
release.  Second, counsel maintained that a probation order would set the
appellant up for failure because, in the past, he had experienced difficulty
complying with multiple reporting obligations due to his mental illness.

II.          
Decisions Below

A.          
Supreme Court of British Columbia (Ehrcke J.),
2014 BCSC 1503

[20]                         
The trial judge rejected the joint submission. 
While giving it “very careful consideration”, he concluded that it did not
“give adequate weight to the principles of denunciation, deterrence, and
protection of the public” (para. 68 (CanLII)).  In its place, instead of
sentencing the appellant to a further term of 18 months in custody, as
requested, he sentenced him to a custodial term of two years less a day (after
credit for pre-sentence custody) — a six month differential.  In addition, he
placed the appellant on probation for three years.

[21]                         
In departing from the joint submission, the
trial judge considered the circumstances of the appellant and the offence, and
various sentencing authorities provided by counsel.  He determined that three
years would be a fit sentence (before credit for pre-sentence custody), and
that any sentence below that “would be an unfit sentence” (para. 43).  In view
of his conclusion that the appellant was entitled to less credit for time spent
in pre-sentence custody than counsel had recommended, he increased the proposed
custodial sentence by six months in order to achieve the effective three-year
sentence he considered “fit”.

[22]                         
The trial judge also rejected the joint
submission to the extent that it did not include an order for probation.  He
considered that such an order was necessary to protect the public because the
treatment team could not control the appellant’s use of street drugs. 
Accordingly, he imposed a three-year probation order, which included a term
prohibiting the appellant from possessing or consuming non-medically prescribed
drugs.

B.           
Court of Appeal for British Columbia (Neilson,
Bennett and Garson JJ.A.), 2015 BCCA 22, 367 B.C.A.C. 96

[23]                         
The Court of Appeal for British Columbia
unanimously dismissed the appellant’s sentence appeal.  Justice Garson, writing
for the court, concluded that the sentence imposed was “fit in the
circumstances” (para. 1).

[24]                         
The court accepted the Crown’s position that it
was unnecessary to decide the test for departing from a joint submission.  In
its view, the trial judge did not err in his assessment of the appropriate
range of sentence, and it was open to him to decline to give the appellant any
credit for time spent in a mental health facility.  Reading the trial judge’s
reasons as a whole, it was clear that he viewed the joint submission as neither
fit, nor in the public interest, having regard to the risk to the public the
appellant posed should he use illegal drugs and fail to comply with his
treatment regime.  In short, the court found no error in the trial judge’s
reasoning or in the sentence he imposed.  

III.       
Analysis

[25]                         
It is an accepted and entirely desirable
practice for Crown and defence counsel to agree to a joint submission on
sentence in exchange for a plea of guilty.  Agreements of this nature are
commonplace and vitally important to the well-being of our criminal justice
system, as well as our justice system at large.  Generally, such agreements are
unexceptional and they are readily approved by trial judges without any
difficulty.  Occasionally, however, a joint submission may appear to be unduly
lenient, or perhaps unduly harsh, and trial judges are not obliged to go along
with them (Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, s. 606(1.1) (b)(iii)). 
In such cases, trial judges need a test against which to measure the
acceptability of the joint submission.  The question is: What test?  

[26]                         
Not unexpectedly, the answer is contentious. 
Provincial appellate courts across the country do not agree on a uniform test,
nor do the parties or the various interveners who appeared before us.  Minor
variations aside, four possible tests or approaches emerge from the submissions
we received.  

[27]                         
The first of these is the “fitness” test.  Under
this test, trial judges should give joint submissions serious consideration,
but may depart from them if, having regard to the circumstances of the case and
the applicable sentencing principles, they conclude that the proposed sentence
is not “fit”.  Some provincial appellate courts use this test, most commonly in
the western provinces (see, for example, R. v. G.W.C., 2000 ABCA
333, 277 A.R. 20, at paras. 17-18; R. v. Bezdan, 2001 BCCA 215, 154
B.C.A.C. 122, at para. 15; R. v. MacIvor, 2003 NSCA 60, 215 N.S.R. (2d)
344, at para. 31).  Crown counsel for the respondent urged us to adopt this
test, arguing that it best reflects the trial judge’s duty to come to an
independent decision regarding the appropriate sentence.  

[28]                         
The second test is also a “fitness” test,
although of a different kind.  It resembles the standard of review that
appellate courts apply on sentencing appeals in circumstances where the
sentence imposed by the trial judge is entitled to deference.  Under this test,
trial judges should not depart from a joint submission unless they conclude
that the sentence proposed is “demonstrably unfit” (R. v. Lacasse, 2015
SCC 64, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089, at para. 11).  This is clearly a more stringent
test than the simple “fitness” test.  However, the parties did not point us to
any appellate decisions that have adopted it, and I am aware of none.

[29]                         
The third test, commonly referred to as the
“public interest” test, was developed in the Report of the Attorney
General’s Advisory Committee on Charge Screening, Disclosure, and Resolution
Discussions (1993) (the “Martin Committee Report”).[2]  Under this test, trial
judges “should not depart from a joint submission unless the proposed sentence
would bring the administration of justice into disrepute, or is otherwise not
in the public interest” (p. 327 (emphasis deleted)).  This test has also been
adopted by a number of provincial appellate courts (see, for example, R. v.
Dorsey (1999), 123 O.A.C. 342, at para. 11; R. v. Druken, 2006 NLCA
67, 261 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 271, at para. 29; R. v. Nome, 2002 BCCA
468, 172 B.C.A.C. 183, at paras. 13-14).  The appellant supports this test,
largely because it provides “a high threshold and is intended to foster
confidence in an accused, who has given up his right to a trial, that the joint
submission he obtained in return for a plea of guilty will be respected by the
sentencing judge” (R. v. Cerasuolo (2001), 151 C.C.C. (3d) 445 (Ont.
C.A.), at para. 8). 

[30]                   
And, finally,
some courts, most notably in Quebec, treat the fitness and public interest
tests as essentially the same, and use the language of the two tests
interchangeably (though in Quebec “reasonableness” is used in place of
“fitness”: see, for example, R. v. Douglas (2002), 162 C.C.C. (3d) 37
(C.A.), at para. 51; R.
v. Dion, 2015 QCCA 1826, at para. 14 (CanLII); R. v. Dumont, 2013
QCCA 576, at para. 12 (CanLII); R. v. Mailhot, 2013 QCCA 870, at para. 7 (CanLII)).  Perhaps the best example of
this is found in Douglas, an oft-referred to decision of the Quebec Court
of Appeal in which Fish J.A. (as he then was) said: 

     In my
view, a reasonable joint submission cannot be said to “bring the administration
of justice into disrepute”.  An unreasonable joint submission, on the
other hand, is surely “contrary to the public interest”.  Accordingly,
though it is purposively framed in striking and evocative terms, I do not
believe that the [public interest test] departs substantially from the test of
reasonableness articulated by other courts, including our own.  Their
shared conceptual foundation is that the interests of justice are well served
by the acceptance of a joint submission on sentence accompanied by a negotiated
plea of guilty ― provided, of course, that the sentence jointly proposed
falls within the acceptable range and the plea is warranted by the facts
admitted.  [Endnote omitted; para. 51.]

[31]                         
Having
considered the various options, I believe that the public interest test, as
amplified in these reasons, is the proper test.  It is more stringent than the
other tests proposed and it best reflects the many benefits that joint
submissions bring to the criminal justice system and the corresponding need for
a high degree of certainty in them.  Moreover, it is distinct from the
“fitness” tests used by trial judges and appellate courts in conventional
sentencing hearings and, in that sense, helps to keep trial judges focused on
the unique considerations that apply when assessing the acceptability of a
joint submission.  To the extent Douglas holds otherwise, I am
respectfully of the view that it is wrongly decided and should not be followed.

A.          
The Proper Test

[32]                         
Under the public interest test, a trial judge
should not depart from a joint submission on sentence unless the proposed
sentence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute or is
otherwise contrary to the public interest.  But, what does this threshold
mean?  Two decisions from the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal are
helpful in this regard.

[33]                         
In Druken, at para. 29, the court held
that a joint submission will bring the administration of justice into disrepute
or be contrary to the public interest if, despite the public interest
considerations that support imposing it, it is so “markedly out of line with
the expectations of reasonable persons aware of the circumstances of the case
that they would view it as a break down in the proper functioning of the
criminal justice system”.  And, as stated by the same court in R. v. B.O.2,
2010 NLCA 19, at para. 56 (CanLII), when assessing a joint submission, trial
judges should “avoid rendering a decision that causes an informed and
reasonable public to lose confidence in the institution of the courts”. 

[34]                         
In my view, these powerful statements capture
the essence of the public interest test developed by the Martin Committee. 
They emphasize that a joint submission should not be rejected lightly, a
conclusion with which I agree.  Rejection denotes a submission so unhinged from
the circumstances of the offence and the offender that its acceptance would
lead reasonable and informed persons, aware of all the relevant circumstances,
including the importance of promoting certainty in resolution discussions, to
believe that the proper functioning of the justice system had broken down. 
This is an undeniably high threshold — and for good reason, as I shall explain.

B.           
Why a Stringent
Test Is Required 

[35]                         
Guilty pleas in exchange for joint submissions
on sentence are a “proper and necessary part of the administration of criminal
justice” (Martin Committee Report, at p. 290).  When plea resolutions are
“properly conducted [they] benefit not only the accused, but also victims,
witnesses, counsel, and the administration of justice generally” (ibid.,
at p. 281 (emphasis deleted)).

[36]                         
Accused persons benefit by pleading guilty in
exchange for a joint submission on sentence (see D. Layton and M. Proulx, Ethics
and Criminal Law (2nd ed. 2015), at p. 436).  The most obvious benefit is
that the Crown agrees to recommend a sentence that the accused is prepared to
accept.  This recommendation is likely to be more lenient than the accused
might expect after a trial and/or contested sentencing hearing.  Accused
persons who plead guilty promptly are able to minimize the stress and legal
costs associated with trials.  Moreover, for those who are truly remorseful, a
guilty plea offers an opportunity to begin making amends.  For many accused,
maximizing certainty as to the outcome is crucial — and a joint submission,
though not inviolable, offers considerable comfort in this regard.

[37]                         
The Martin Committee recognized this.  As it
noted at p. 328 of its report, the most important factor in the “ability to
conclude resolution agreements, thereby deriving the benefits that such
agreements bring, is that of certainty”.  Generally speaking, accused persons
will not give up their right to a trial on the merits, and all the procedural
safeguards it entails, unless they have “some assurance that [trial judges]
will in most instances honour agreements entered into by the Crown” (Cerasuolo,
at para. 9).

[38]                         
The Crown also relies on the certainty of joint
submissions.  Agreements that are certain are attractive to the Crown “because
there is less risk that what Crown counsel concludes is an appropriate
resolution of the case in the public interest will be undercut” (Martin Committee
Report, at p. 328).

[39]                         
From the Crown’s perspective, the certain or
near certain acceptance of joint submissions on sentence offers several
potential benefits.  First, the guarantee of a conviction that comes with a
guilty plea makes resolution desirable (Martin Committee Report, at pp.
285-86).  The Crown’s case may suffer from flaws, such as an unwilling witness,
a witness of dubious worth, or evidence that is potentially inadmissible —
problems that can lead to an acquittal.  By agreeing to a joint submission in
exchange for a guilty plea, the Crown avoids this risk.  Second, the accused
may have information or testimony to offer the Crown that can prove invaluable
to other investigations or prosecutions.  But this information may not be
forthcoming absent an agreement as to a joint submission.  Third, the Crown may
consider it best to resolve a particular case for the benefit of victims or
witnesses.  When an accused pleads guilty in exchange for a joint submission on
sentence, victims and witnesses are spared the “the emotional cost of a trial”
(R. v. Edgar, 2010 ONCA 529, 101 O.R. (3d) 161, at para. 111). 
Moreover, victims may obtain some comfort from a guilty plea, given that it
“indicates an accused’s acknowledgement of responsibility and may amount to an
expression of remorse” (ibid.).

[40]                         
In addition to the many benefits that joint
submissions offer to participants in the criminal justice system, they play a
vital role in contributing to the administration of justice at large.  The
prospect of a joint submission that carries with it a high degree of certainty
encourages accused persons to enter a plea of guilty.  And guilty pleas save
the justice system precious time, resources, and expenses, which can be
channeled into other matters.  This is no small benefit.  To the extent that
they avoid trials, joint submissions on sentence permit our justice system to
function more efficiently.  Indeed, I would argue that they permit it to
function.  Without them, our justice system would be brought to its knees, and
eventually collapse under its own weight. 

[41]                         
But as I have said, for joint submissions to be
possible, the parties must have a high degree of confidence that they will be
accepted.  Too much doubt and the parties may choose instead to accept the
risks of a trial or a contested sentencing hearing.  The accused in particular
will be reluctant to forgo a trial with its attendant safeguards, including the
crucial ability to test the strength of the Crown’s case, if joint submissions
come to be seen as an insufficiently certain alternative.  

[42]                         
Hence, the importance of trial judges exhibiting
restraint, rejecting joint submissions only where the proposed sentence would
be viewed by reasonable and informed persons as a breakdown in the proper
functioning of the justice system.  A lower threshold than this would cast the
efficacy of resolution agreements into too great a degree of uncertainty.  The
public interest test ensures that these resolution agreements are afforded a
high degree of certainty.

[43]                         
At the same time, this test also recognizes that
certainty of outcome is not “the ultimate goal of the sentencing process. 
Certainty must yield where the harm caused by accepting the joint submission is
beyond the value gained by promoting certainty of result” (R. v. DeSousa,
2012 ONCA 254, 109 O.R. (3d) 792, per Doherty J.A., at para. 22). 

[44]                         
Finally, I note that a high threshold for
departing from joint submissions is not only necessary to obtain all the
benefits of joint submissions, it is appropriate.  Crown and defence counsel
are well placed to arrive at a joint submission that reflects the interests of
both the public and the accused (Martin Committee Report, at p. 287).  As a
rule, they will be highly knowledgeable about the circumstances of the offender
and the offence and the strengths and weaknesses of their respective
positions.  The Crown is charged with representing the community’s interest in
seeing that justice is done (R. v. Power, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 601, at p.
616).  Defence counsel is required to act in the accused’s best interests,
which includes ensuring that the accused’s plea is voluntary and informed (see,
for example, Law Society of British Columbia, Code of Professional Conduct
for British Columbia (online), rule 5.1-8).  And both counsel are bound
professionally and ethically not to mislead the court (ibid., rule
2.1-2(c)).  In short, they are entirely capable of arriving at resolutions that
are fair and consistent with the public interest (Martin Committee Report, at
p. 287).

[45]                         
Bearing in mind these benefits and the need for
certainty, I turn to the other tests proposed by the respondent Crown and some
of the interveners.

C.           
The Fitness of Sentence and Demonstrably Unfit
Tests Should Be Rejected

[46]                         
As indicated, the position of the respondent is
that while trial judges should give serious consideration to joint submissions,
such submissions may be rejected on a simple “fitness” test.  With respect,
this test is not sufficiently stringent.  Under it, trial judges must ask what
a fit or appropriate sentence would be, instead of asking whether the
sentence proposed would be viewed by reasonable and informed persons as a
breakdown in the proper functioning of the justice system.  In short, the
“fitness” test does not direct trial judges to approach joint submissions from
a position of restraint.  Rather, it sends a different, and in my view, a wrong
signal: that they may interfere if they have a different view of what a “fit”
sentence would be.  If trial judges were free to interfere on this basis, the
result would be to “effectively eliminate the use of plea bargaining as part of
the criminal prosecution process” (R. v. Oxford, 2010 NLCA 45, 299 Nfld.
& P.E.I.R. 327, at para. 55).  

[47]                         
While the “demonstrably unfit” test used by
appellate courts is undoubtedly a higher threshold than the simple “fitness”
test, in rare cases, this threshold may not be sufficiently robust for the
joint submission context.  I would not rule out the possibility that a sentence
which would otherwise be considered demonstrably unfit absent a joint
submission may nonetheless be acceptable in the context of one.  For example,
take the case of an accused involved in a very serious crime that the Crown may
have difficulty proving because of deficiencies in its case.  The accused
agrees to plead guilty, and to assist the Crown in prosecuting his co-conspirators
for this and other more serious offences.  The Crown might reasonably conclude
that it is in the public interest to agree, by way of a joint submission, to a
very lenient sentence in order to obtain the accused’s guilty plea and his
assistance.  In short, a very lenient, even “demonstrably unfit” sentence may,
in a particular case, serve the greater good. 

[48]                         
Further, both the fitness test and the appellate
“demonstrably unfit” test suffer from a similar flaw: they are designed for
different contexts.  As such, there is an appreciable risk that the approaches
which apply to conventional sentencing hearings or sentencing appeals will be
conflated with the approach that must be adhered to on a joint submission.  In
conventional sentencing hearings, trial judges look at the circumstances of the
offender and the offence, and the applicable sentencing principles.  They are
not asked to consider the critical systemic benefits that flow from joint
submissions, namely, the ability of the justice system to function fairly and
efficiently.  Similarly, appellate courts are not bound to consider these
systemic benefits on a conventional sentencing appeal.  The public interest
test avoids these pitfalls.

D.          
Guidance for Trial Judges 

[49]                         
Finally, I would offer some brief guidance to
trial judges on the approach they should follow when they are troubled by a
joint submission on sentence.

[50]                         
Courts across the country are generally in
agreement on the procedure judges should follow when they are inclined to
depart from a joint submission (see, for example, B.O.2, at paras.
74-82; R. v. Sinclair, 2004 MBCA 48, 185 C.C.C. (3d) 569,
at para. 17; G.W.C., at para. 26).  The parties and interveners
emphasize the importance of procedure.  It ensures that joint submissions are
given proper consideration, and that accused persons — who have already entered
a plea of guilty — are treated fairly.  The following procedures reflect
practical wisdom gained from the experience of our trial and appellate courts. 
They are meant to apply only to those cases where the joint submission is
contentious and raises concerns with the trial judge.  As I mentioned earlier,
most joint submissions are unexceptional and are readily approved by trial
judges without any difficulty.[3]


[51]                         
First, trial judges should approach the joint
submission on an “as-is” basis.  That is to say, the public interest test
applies whether the judge is considering varying the proposed sentence or
adding something to it that the parties have not mentioned, for example, a
probation order.  If the parties have not asked for a particular order, the
trial judge should assume that it was considered and excluded from the joint
submission.  However, if counsel have neglected to include a mandatory order,
the judge should not hesitate to inform counsel.  The need for certainty in
joint submissions cannot justify failing to impose a mandatory order.

[52]                         
Second, trial judges should apply the public
interest test when they are considering “jumping” or “undercutting” a joint
submission (DeSousa, per Doherty J.A.). That is not to say that the
analysis will be the same in either case.  On the contrary, from the accused’s
perspective, “undercutting” does not engage concerns about fair trial rights or
undermine confidence in the certainty of plea negotiations. In addition, in assessing whether the severity of a
joint submission would offend the public interest, trial judges should be
mindful of the power imbalance that may exist between the Crown and defence,
particularly where the accused is self-represented or in custody at the time of
sentencing. These factors may temper the public interest in certainty and
justify “undercutting” in limited circumstances. At the same time, where the trial judge is considering “undercutting”, he or she
should bear in mind that the community’s confidence in the administration of
justice may suffer if an accused enjoys the benefits of a joint submission
without having to serve the agreed-upon sentence (see DeSousa, at paras.
23-24).

[53]                         
Third, when faced with a contentious joint
submission, trial judges will undoubtedly want to know about the circumstances
leading to the joint submission — and in particular, any benefits obtained by
the Crown or concessions made by the accused.  The greater the benefits
obtained by the Crown, and the more concessions made by the accused, the more
likely it is that the trial judge should accept the joint submission, even
though it may appear to be unduly lenient.  For example, if the joint
submission is the product of an agreement by the accused to assist the Crown or
police, or an evidentiary weakness in the Crown’s case, a very lenient sentence
might not be contrary to the public interest.  On the other hand, if the joint
submission resulted only from the accused’s realization that conviction was
inevitable, the same sentence might cause the public to lose confidence in the
criminal justice system. 

[54]                         
Counsel should, of course, provide the court
with a full account of the circumstances of the offender, the offence, and the
joint submission without waiting for a specific request from the trial judge. 
As trial judges are obliged to depart only rarely from joint submissions, there
is a “corollary obligation upon counsel” to ensure that they “amply justify
their position on the facts of the case as presented in open court” (Martin
Committee Report, at p. 329).  Sentencing — including sentencing based on a
joint submission — cannot be done in the dark.  The Crown and the defence must
“provide the trial judge not only with the proposed sentence, but with a full
description of the facts relevant to the offender and the offence”, in order to
give the judge “a proper basis upon which to determine whether [the joint
submission] should be accepted” (DeSousa, at para. 15; see also Sinclair,
at para. 14).

[55]                         
This is not to say that counsel must inform the
trial judge of “their negotiating positions or the substance of their
discussions leading to the agreement” (R. v. Tkachuk, 2001 ABCA 243, 293
A.R. 171, at para. 34).  But counsel must be able to inform the trial judge why
the proposed sentence would not bring the administration of justice into
disrepute or otherwise be contrary to the public interest.  If they do not,
they run the risk that the trial judge will reject the joint submission. 

[56]                         
There may, of course, be cases where it is not
possible to put the main considerations underlying a joint submission on the
public record because of safety or privacy concerns, or the risk of
jeopardizing ongoing criminal investigations (see Martin Committee Report, at
p. 317).  In such cases, counsel must find alternative means of communicating
these considerations to the trial judge in order to ensure that the judge is
apprised of the relevant considerations and that a proper record is created for
appeal purposes.  

[57]                         
A thorough justification of the joint submission
also has an important public perception component.  Unless counsel put the
considerations underlying the joint submission on the record, “though justice
may be done, it may not have the appearance of being done; the public may
suspect, rightly or wrongly, that an impropriety has occurred” (C. C. Ruby, G.
J. Chan and N. R. Hasan, Sentencing (8th ed. 2012), at p. 73).  

[58]                         
Fourth, if the trial judge is not satisfied with
the sentence proposed by counsel, “fundamental fairness dictates that an
opportunity be afforded to counsel to make further submissions in an attempt to
address the . . . judge’s concerns before the sentence is imposed” (G.W.C.,
at para. 26).  The judge should notify counsel that he or she has concerns, and
invite further submissions on those concerns, including the possibility of
allowing the accused to withdraw his or her guilty plea, as the trial judge did
in this case.  

[59]                         
Fifth, if the trial judge’s concerns about the joint
submission are not alleviated, the judge may allow the accused to apply to
withdraw his or her guilty plea.  The circumstances in which a plea may be
withdrawn need not be settled here.  However, by way of example, withdrawal may
be permitted where counsel have made a fundamental error about the legality of
the proposed joint submission, for example, where a conditional sentence has
been proposed but is unavailable. 

[60]                         
Finally, trial judges who remain unsatisfied by
counsel’s submissions should provide clear and cogent reasons for departing
from the joint submission.  These reasons will help explain to the parties why
the proposed sentence was unacceptable, and may assist them in the resolution
of future cases.  Reasons will also facilitate appellate review.

IV.       
Application 

[61]                         
The Crown submits that on any test, the trial
judge was entitled to depart from the joint submission.  Respectfully, I cannot
agree.  Setting aside that the trial judge failed to apply the proper test — he
asked only whether the joint submission was fit — he failed to take into
account the important systemic benefits of joint submissions, and the
corresponding need for them to be reasonably certain.  

[62]                         
In terms of the custodial sentence, it appears
the trial judge treated the joint submission as though it was a conventional
sentencing hearing.  With respect, he erred in doing so.  The parties made a
clear and firm recommendation on the appropriate sentence.  Importantly, the
Crown did not resile from the joint submission, but maintained his position
that he was seeking a further period of 18 months in custody even after he
learned of the calculation error.  

[63]                         
In my respectful view, there was no basis for
the trial judge to substitute his opinion for the considered agreement of
counsel.  The custodial term proposed, while low, was not so low as to bring
the administration of justice into disrepute or be contrary to the public
interest.  It was close to the range of sentence identified by the trial judge,
and, as I have said, joint submissions promote the smooth operation of the
criminal justice system.  The appellant gave up his right to a trial and any
self-defence argument he may have had.  In the end, the trial judge’s deviation
from the recommended custodial sentence — by only six months — amounts to
little more than tinkering.  

[64]                         
The probation order raises more difficult
questions, but, in my view, it should not have been made.  While the trial
judge had reason to be concerned about how the appellant would manage in the
community, these concerns were addressed by counsel (see para. 19, above).  

[65]                         
Normally a probation order requiring that the
accused refrain from the use of non-medically prescribed drugs would be, if not
essential, certainly warranted where it is shown that an accused’s drug addiction
has contributed to his offending.  However, the failure to impose such an order
in the context of a joint submission is not necessarily fatal, particularly in
a case like this, where the reason for the order is somewhat attenuated by the
Director’s warrant and the likelihood that the order would be self-defeating.  

[66]                         
The Crown, having considered the public
interest, obviously felt that society would be adequately protected without a
probation order.  Counsel’s view that the probation order was duplicative and
therefore unnecessary to protect the public was reasonable in the
circumstances.  In fact, counsel appear to have come to a practical decision on
how best to further the appellant’s rehabilitation while ensuring the public’s
protection. 

V.          
Conclusion

[67]                         
I would allow the appeal, and vary the
appellant’s sentence to bring it into conformity with the joint submission,
namely, that the appellant serve an additional 18 months in custody, with no
period of probation to follow.  The sentence jointly proposed by the Crown and
defence was not one that would bring the administration of justice into
disrepute, nor was it otherwise contrary to the public interest.

REGINA




v.




IRELAND 
(APPELLANT) 


ON 24 JULY 1997





LORD GOFF OF CHIEVELEY
 



My Lords, 


    I have had an opportunity of reading in draft the 
speeches prepared by my noble and learned friends, Lord Steyn and Lord Hope of 
Craighead. I agree with them, and for the reasons they give I would dismiss both 
appeals. 




LORD SLYNN OF HADLEY
 



My Lords, 


    I have had the advantage of reading the draft of the 
speech prepared by my noble and learned friend, Lord Steyn. For the reasons he 
gives I too would dismiss both appeals. I would, however, reiterate that in 

Ireland
 the question as to whether there was a fear of immediate violence 
for the purposes of section 47 of the Act and the question as to how the concept 
of immediacy is to be applied, in a case where words or silence by someone using 
the telephone are relied on as constituting the assault, did not arise for 
decision. 




LORD STEYN
 



My Lords,


    It is easy to understand the terrifying effect of a 
campaign of telephone calls at night by a silent caller to a woman living on her 
own. It would be natural for the victim to regard the calls as menacing. What 
may heighten her fear is that she will not know what the caller may do next. The 
spectre of the caller arriving at her doorstep bent on inflicting personal 
violence on her may come to dominate her thinking. After all, as a matter of 
common sense, what else would she be terrified about? The victim may suffer 
psychiatric illness such as anxiety neurosis or acute depression. Harassment of 
women by repeated silent telephone calls, accompanied on occasions by heavy 
breathing, is apparently a significant social problem. That the criminal law 
should be able to deal with this problem, and so far as is practicable, afford 
effective protection to victims is self evident. 


    From the point of view, however, of the general 
policy of our law towards the imposition of criminal responsibility, three 
specific features of the problem must be faced squarely. First, the medium used 
by the caller is the telephone: arguably it differs qualitatively from a 
face-to-face offer of violence to a sufficient extent to make a difference. 
Secondly, ex hypothesi the caller remains silent: arguably a caller may avoid 
the reach of the criminal law by remaining silent however menacing the context 
may be. Thirdly, it is arguable that the criminal law does not take into account 
""mere"" psychiatric illnesses. 


    At first glance it may seem that the legislature has 
satisfactorily dealt with such objections by section 43(1) of the 
Telecommunications Act 1984 which makes it an offence persistently to make use 
of a public telecommunications system for the purpose of causing annoyance, 
inconvenience or needless anxiety to another. The maximum custodial penalty is 
six months imprisonment. This penalty may be inadequate to reflect a culpability 
of a persistent offender who causes serious psychiatric illness to another. For 
the future there will be for consideration the provisions of sections 1 and 2 of 
the Protection from the Harassment Act 1997, not yet in force, which creates the 
offence of pursuing a course of conduct which amounts to harassment of another 
and which he knows or ought to know amounts to harassment of the other. The 
maximum custodial penalty is six months imprisonment. This penalty may also be 
inadequate to deal with persistent offenders who cause serious psychiatric 
injury to victims. Section 4(1) of the Act of 1997 which creates the offence of 
putting people in fear of violence seems more appropriate. It provides for 
maximum custodial penalty upon conviction on indictment of five years 
imprisonment. On the other hand, section 4 only applies when as a result of a 
course of conduct the victim has cause to fear, on at least two occasions, that 
violence 
will
 be used against her. It may be difficult to secure a 
conviction in respect of a silent caller: the victim in such cases may have 
cause to fear that violence 
may
 be used against her but no more. In my 
view, therefore, the provisions of these two statutes are not ideally suited to 
deal with the significant problem which I have described. One must therefore 
look elsewhere. 


    It is to the provisions of the Offences against the 
Person Act 1861 that one must turn to examine whether our law provides effective 
criminal sanctions for this type of case. In descending order of seriousness the 
familiar trilogy of sections (as amended) provide as follows: 


 ""18. Whosoever shall unlawfully and maliciously by any means 
  whatsoever . . . cause any grievous bodily harm to any person . . . with 
  intent . . . to do some grievous bodily harm to any person, . . . shall be 
  guilty of felony and being convicted thereof shall be liable . . . to 
  [imprisonment] for life . . . . 


 ""20. Whosoever shall unlawfully and maliciously . . . inflict 
  any grievous bodily harm upon any other person, either with or without any 
  weapon or instrument, shall be guilt of a misdemeanour, and being convicted 
  therefore shall be liable [to imprisonment . . . for not more than five 
  years.] 


 ""47. Whosoever shall be convicted upon an indictment of any 
  assault occasioning actual bodily harm shall be liable . . . [to imprisonment 
  for not more than five years]."" 
Making due allowance for the incongruities in these provisions, the sections 
can be described as ""a ladder of offences graded in terms of relative 
seriousness"": 
Ashworth
, 
Principles of Criminal Law
, 2nd ed. 
(1995), at p. 313. An ingredient of each of the offences is ""bodily harm"" to a 
person. In respect of each section the threshold question is therefore whether a 
psychiatric illness, as testified to by a psychiatrist, can amount to ""bodily 
harm."" If the answer to this question is no, it will follow that the Act of 1861 
cannot be used to prosecute in the class of cases which I have described. On the 
other hand, if the answer to the question is yes, it will be necessary to 
consider whether the persistent silent caller, who terrifies his victim and 
causes her to suffer a psychiatric illness, can be criminally liable under any 
of these sections. Given that the caller uses the medium of the telephone and 
silence to terrify his victim, is he beyond the reach of these sections? 


    Similar problems arise in the case of the so called 
stalker, who pursues a campaign of harassment by more diffuse means. He may 
intend to terrify the woman and succeed in doing so, by relentlessly following 
her, by unnecessarily appearing at her home and place of work, photographing 
her, and so forth. Is he beyond the reach of the trilogy of sections in the Act 
of 1861? 


The two appeals before the House
 


    There are two appeals before the House. In 

Ireland
 the appellant was convicted on his plea of guilty of three 
offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, contrary to section 47 of 
the Act of 1861. The judgment of the Court of Appeal dismissing his appeal is 
reported: 
Reg. v. Ireland
 [1997] Q.B. 114. The case against Ireland was 
that during a period of three months in 1994 covered by the indictment he 
harassed three women by making repeated telephone calls to them during which he 
remain silent. Sometimes, he resorted to heavy breathing. The calls were mostly 
made at night. The case against him, which was accepted by the judge and the 
Court of Appeal, was that he caused his victim to suffer psychiatric illness. 
Ireland had a substantial record of making offensive telephone calls to women. 
The judge sentenced him to a total of three years imprisonment. 


    Before the Court of Appeal there were two principal 
issues. The first was whether psychiatric illness may amount to bodily harm 
within the meaning of section 47 of the Act of 1861. Relying on a decision of 
the Court of Appeal in 
Reg. v. Chan-Fook
 
[1994] 1 WLR 689
 the Court of Appeal in 
Ireland's
 case concluded that psychiatric 
injury may amount to bodily harm under section 47 of the Act of 1861. The second 
issue was whether Ireland's conduct was capable of amounting to an assault. In 
giving the judgment of the court in Ireland's case Swinton Thomas L.J. said (at 
p. 119): 


 ""It has been recognised for many centuries that putting a person in 
  fear may amount to an assault. The early cases predate the invention of the 
  telephone. We must apply the law to conditions as they are in the 20th 
  century."" 
The court concluded that repeated telephone calls of a menacing nature may 
cause victims to apprehend immediate and unlawful violence. Given these 
conclusions of law, and Ireland's guilty plea, the Court of Appeal dismissed the 
appeal. The Court of Appeal certified the following question as being of general 
public importance, namely ""As to whether the making of a series of silent 
telephone calls can amount in law to an assault."" But it will also be necessary 
to consider the question whether psychiatric illness may in law amount to bodily 
harm under section 47 of the Act of 1861. Those are the issues of law before the 
House in the appeal of 
Ireland
.


    In 
Reg. v. Burstow
 the appellant was indicted 
on one count of unlawfully and maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm, 
contrary to section 20 of the Act of 1861. The facts are fully set out in the 
reported judgment of the Court of Appeal: 
Reg. v. Burstow
 [1997] 1 
Cr.App.R. 144. I can therefore describe the facts shortly. Burstow had a social 
relationship with a woman. She broke it off. He could not accept her decision. 
He proceeded to harass her in various ways over a lengthy period. His conduct 
led to several convictions and periods of imprisonment. During an eight month 
period in 1995 covered by the indictment he continued his campaign of 
harassment. He made some silent telephone calls to her. He also made abusive 
calls to her. He distributed offensive cards in the street where she lived. He 
was frequently, and unnecessarily, at her home and place of work. He 
surreptitiously took photographs of the victim and her family. He sent her a 
note which was intended to be menacing, and was so understood. The victim was 
badly affected by this campaign of harassment. It preyed on her mind. She was 
fearful of personal violence. A consultant psychiatrist stated that she was 
suffering from a severe depressive illness. In the Crown Court counsel asked for 
a ruling whether an offence of unlawfully and maliciously inflicting grievous 
bodily harm contrary to section 20 may be committed where no physical violence 
has been applied directly or indirectly to the body of the victim. The judge 
answered this question in the affirmative. Burstow thereupon changed his plea to 
guilty. The judge sentenced him to three year's imprisonment. Burstow applied 
for leave to appeal against conviction. The Court of Appeal heard full oral 
argument on the application, and granted the application for leave to appeal but 
dismissed the appeal. Two questions of law were canvassed before the Court of 
Appeal. First, there was the question whether psychiatric injury may amount to 
bodily harm under section 20. The Court of Appeal regarded itself as bound by 
the affirmative decision in 
Reg. v. Chan-Fook
 
[1994] 1 WLR 689
. The second issue was whether in the absence of physical violence 
applied directly or indirectly to the body of the victim an offence under 
section 20 may be committed. The Court of Appeal concluded that this question 
must be answered in the affirmative. The concluding observations of Lord Bingham 
of Cornhill C.J. were as follows, at p. 149:


 ""It is not straining language to speak of one person inflicting 
  psychiatric injury on another. It would in our judgment be an affront to 
  common sense to distinguish between section 18 and section 20 in the way 
  contended for by the applicant. It would also, we think, introduce extreme and 
  undesirable artificiality into what should be a very practical area of the law 
  if we were to hold that, although grievous bodily harm includes psychiatric 
  injury, no offence against section 20 is committed unless such psychiatric 
  injury is the result of physical violence applied directly or indirectly to 
  the body of the victim. The decision in 
Chan-Fook
 is in our view fatal 
  to the applicant's submission."" 
In the result the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal against conviction. 
The court certified the following point as of general importance, namely: 


 ""Whether an offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm under section 
  20 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 can be committed where no 
  physical violence is applied directly or indirectly to the body of the 
  victim."" 
    It will be noted that in neither appeal is there an 
issue on mens rea: the appeals focus on questions of law regarding the actus 
reus. 


The common question: Can psychiatric illness amount to bodily 
harm?
 


    It will now be convenient to consider the question 
which is common to the two appeals, namely, whether psychiatric illness is 
capable of amounting to bodily harm in terms of sections 18, 20 and 47 of the 
Act of 1861. The answer must be the same for the three sections. 


    The only abiding thing about the processes of the 
human mind, and the causes of its disorders and disturbances, is that there will 
never be a complete explanation. Psychiatry is and will always remain an 
imperfectly understood branch of medical science. This idea is explained by 
Vallar's psychiatrist in 
Iris Murdoch's 
The Message to the Planet
: 



 ""Our knowledge of the soul, if I may use that unclinical but 
  essential word, encounters certain seemingly impassable limits, set there 
  perhaps by the gods, if I may refer to them, in order to preserve their 
  privacy, and beyond which it may be not only futile but lethal to attempt to 
  pass and though it is our duty to seek for knowledge, it is also incumbent on 
  us to realise when it is denied us, and not to prefer a fake solution to no 
  solution at all.""
But there has been progress since 1861. And courts of law can only act on the 
best scientific understanding of the day. Some elementary distinctions can be 
made. The appeals under consideration do not involve structural injuries to the 
brain such as might require the intervention of a neurologist. One is also not 
considering either psychotic illness or personality disorders. The victims in 
the two appeals suffered from no such conditions. As a result of the behaviour 
of the appellants they did not develop psychotic or psychoneurotic conditions. 
The case was that they developed mental disturbances of a lesser order, namely 
neurotic disorders. For present purposes the relevant forms of neurosis are 
anxiety disorders and depressive disorders. Neuroses must be distinguished from 
simple states of fear, or problems in coping with every day life. Where the line 
is to be drawn must be a matter of psychiatric judgment. But for present 
purposes it is important to note that modern psychiatry treats neuroses as 
recognisable psychiatric illnesses: see 
Liability for 
Psychiatric 
Injury,
 Law Commission Consultation paper No. 137 (1995) Part III (
The 
Medical Background)
; 
Mullany and Hanford,
 
Tort Liability for 
Psychiatric
 
Damages
, (1993), discussion on ""The Medical Perspective,"" 
at pp. 24-42, and particular at 30, footnote 88. Moreover, it is essential to 
bear in mind that neurotic illnesses affect the central nervous system of the 
body, because emotions such as fear and anxiety are brain functions. 


    The civil law has for a long time taken account of 
the fact that there is no rigid distinction between body and mind. In 

Bourhill v. Young
 
[1943] AC 92
, 103 
Lord Macmillan said: 


 ""The crude view that the law should take cognisance only of physical 
  injury resulting from actual impact has been discarded, and it is now well 
  recognised that an action will lie for injury by shock sustained through the 
  medium of the eye or the ear without direct physical contact. The distinction 
  between mental shock and bodily injury was never a scientific one. . . 
.""
This idea underlies the subsequent decisions of the House of Lords regarding 
post-traumatic stress disorder in 
McLoughlin v. O'Brian
 
[1983] 1 AC 410
, 
418, 
per
 Lord Wilberforce; and 
Page v. Smith
 
[1996] AC 155
, 
181A-D, 
per
 Lord Browne-Wilkinson. So far as such cases are concerned 
with the precise boundaries of tort liability they are not relevant. But so far 
as those decisions are based on the principle that the claimant must be able to 
prove that he suffered a recognisable psychiatric illness or condition they are 
by analogy relevant. The decisions of the House of Lords on post-traumatic 
stress disorder hold that where the line is to be drawn is a matter for expert 
psychiatric evidence. By analogy those decisions suggest a possible principled 
approach to the question whether psychiatric injury may amount to bodily harm in 
terms of the Act of 1861.


    The criminal law has been slow to follow this path. 
But in 
Reg. v. Chan-Fook
 
[1994] 1 WLR 689
 the Court of Appeal squarely addressed the question whether psychiatric 
injury may amount to bodily harm under section 47 of the Act of 1861. The issue 
arose in a case where the defendant had aggressively questioned and locked in a 
suspected thief. There was a dispute as to whether the defendant had physically 
assaulted the victim. But the prosecution also alleged that even if the victim 
had suffered no physical injury, he had been reduced to a mental state which 
amounted to actual bodily harm under section 47. No psychiatric evidence was 
given. The judge directed the jury that an assault which caused an hysterical 
and nervous condition was an assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The 
defendant was convicted. Upon appeal the conviction was quashed on the ground of 
misdirections in the summing up and the absence of psychiatric evidence to 
support the prosecution's alternative case. The interest of the decision lies in 
the reasoning on psychiatric injury in the context of section 47. In a detailed 
and careful judgment given on behalf of the court Hobhouse L.J. said (at p. 
695G-H)): 


  ""The first question on the present appeal is whether the 
  inclusion of the word 'bodily' in the phrase 'actual bodily harm' limits harm 
  to harm to the skin, flesh and bones of the victim. . . . The body of the 
  victim includes all parts of his body, including his organs, his nervous 
  system and his brain. Bodily injury therefore may include injury to any of 
  those parts of his body responsible for his mental and other faculties."" 

In concluding that ""actual bodily harm"" is capable of including psychiatric 
injury Hobhouse L.J. emphasised (at p. 696C) that ""it does not include mere 
emotions such as fear or distress nor panic nor does it include, as such, states 
of mind that are not themselves evidence of some identifiable clinical 
condition."" He observed that in the absence of psychiatric evidence a question 
whether or not an assault occasioned psychiatric injury should not be left to 
the jury.


    The Court of Appeal, as differently constituted in 

Ireland
 and 
Burstow
, was bound by the decision in 

Chan-Fook
. The House is not so bound. Counsel for the appellants in both 
appeals submitted that bodily harm in Victorian legislation cannot include 
psychiatric injury. For this reason they argued that 
Chan-Fook
 was 
wrongly decided. They relied on the following observation of Lord Bingham of 
Cornhill C.J. in 
Burstow
 [1997] 1 Cr.App.R. 144, 148: 


 ""Were the question free from authority, we should entertain some 
  doubt whether the Victorian draftsman of the 1861 Act intended to embrace 
  psychiatric injury within the expressions 'grievous bodily harm' and 'actual 
  bodily harm'."" 
Nevertheless, the Lord Chief Justice observed that it is now accepted that in 
the relevant context the distinction between physical and mental injury is by no 
means clear cut. He welcomed the ruling in 
Chan-Fook
: at p. 149B. I 
respectfully agree. But I would go further and point out that, although out of 
considerations of piety we frequently refer to the actual intention of the 
draftsman, the correct approach is simply to consider whether the words of the 
Act of 1861 considered in the light of contemporary knowledge cover a 
recognisable psychiatric injury. It is undoubtedly true that there are statutes 
where the correct approach is to construe the legislation ""as if one were 
interpreting it the day after it was passed:"" 
The
 
Longford
 (1889) 
14 P.D. 34. Thus in 
The Longford
 the word ""action"" in a statute was held 
not to be apt to cover an Admiralty action in rem since when it was passed the 
Admiralty Court ""was not one of His Majesty's Courts of Law:"" (see pp. 37, 38.) 
Bearing in mind that statutes are usually intended to operate for many years it 
would be most inconvenient if courts could never rely in difficult cases on the 
current meaning of statutes. Recognising the problem Lord Thring, the great 
Victorian draftsman of the second half of the last century, exhorted draftsmen 
to draft so that ""An Act of Parliament should be deemed to be always speaking"": 

Practical Legislation
 (1902), p. 83; see also 
Cross
, 
Statutory 
Interpretation
, 3rd ed. (1995), p. 51; 
Pearce and Geddes
, 

Statutory Interpretation in Australia
, 4th ed. (1996), pp. 90-93. In 
cases where the problem arises it is a matter of interpretation whether a court 
must search for the historical or original meaning of a statute or whether it is 
free to apply the current meaning of the statute to present day conditions. 
Statutes dealing with a particular grievance or problem may sometimes require to 
be historically interpreted. But the drafting technique of Lord 
Thring
 
and his successors have brought about the situation that statutes will generally 
be found to be of the ""always speaking"" variety: see 
Royal College of Nursing 
of the United Kingdom v. Department of Health and Social Security
 
[1981] AC 800
 for 
an example of an ""always speaking"" construction in the House of Lords.


    The proposition that the Victorian legislator when 
enacting sections 18, 20 and 47 of the Act 1861, would not have had in mind 
psychiatric illness is no doubt correct. Psychiatry was in its infancy in 1861. 
But the subjective intention of the draftsman is immaterial. The only relevant 
enquiry is as to the sense of the words in the context in which they are used. 
Moreover the Act of 1861 is a statute of the ""always speaking"" type: the statute 
must be interpreted in the light of the best current scientific appreciation of 
the link between the body and psychiatric injury.


    For these reasons I would, therefore, reject the 
challenge to the correctness of 
Chan-Fook
 
[1994] 1 WLR 689
. In my view the ruling in that case was based on principled and cogent 
reasoning and it marked a sound and essential clarification of the law. I would 
hold that ""bodily harm"" in sections 18, 20 and 47 must be interpreted so as to 
include recognizable psychiatric illness. 


Reg. v. Burstow: the meaning of ""inflict"" in section 20
 


    The decision in 
Chan-Fook
 opened up the 
possibility of applying sections 18, 20 and 47 in new circumstances. The appeal 
of Burstow lies in respect of his conviction under section 20. It was conceded 
that in principle the wording of section 18, and in particular the words ""cause 
any grievous bodily harm to any person"" do not preclude a prosecution in cases 
where the actus reus is the causing of psychiatric injury. But counsel laid 
stress on the difference between ""causing"" grievous bodily harm in section 18 
and ""inflicting"" grievous bodily harm in section 20. Counsel argued that the 
difference in wording reveals a difference in legislative intent: inflict is a 
narrower concept than cause. This argument loses sight of the genesis of 
sections 18 and 20. In his commentary on the Act of 1861 Greaves, the draftsman, 
explained the position: 
The Criminal Law Consolidation and Amendment 
Acts
, 2nd ed. (1862). He said (at pp. 3-4):


  


  ""If any question should arise in which any comparison may be 
  instituted between different sections of any one or several of these Acts, it 
  must be carefully borne in mind in what manner these Acts were framed. None of 
  them was re-written; on the contrary, each contains enactments taken from 
  different Acts passed at different times and with different views, and 
  frequently varying from each other in phraseology, and . . . these enactments, 
  for the most part, stand in these Acts with little or no variation in their 
  phraseology, and, consequently, their differences in that respect will be 
  found generally to remain in these Acts. It follows, therefore, from hence, 
  that any argument as to a difference in the intention of the legislature, 
  which may be drawn from a difference in the terms of one clause from those in 
  another, will be entitled to no weight in the construction of such clauses; 
  for that argument can only apply with force where an Act is framed from 
  beginning to end with one and the same view, and with the intention of making 
  it thoroughly consistent throughout.""


The difference in language is therefore not a significant factor.


    Counsel for Burstow then advanced a sustained 
argument that an assault is an ingredient of an offence under section 20. He 
referred your Lordships to cases which in my judgment simply do not yield what 
he sought to extract from them. In any event, the tour of the cases revealed 
conflicting 
dicta
, no authority binding on the House of Lords, and no 
settled practice holding expressly that assault was an ingredient of section 20. 
And, needless to say, none of the cases focused on the infliction of psychiatric 
injury. In these circumstances I do not propose to embark on a general review of 
the cases cited: compare the review in 
Smith and Hogan,
 
Criminal 
Law
, 8th ed. (1996), pp. 440-441. Instead I turn to the words of the 
section. Counsel's argument can only prevail if one may supplement the section 
by reading it as providing ""inflict 
by assault
 any grievous bodily harm."" 
Such an implication is, however, not necessary. On the contrary, section 20, 
like section 18, works perfectly satisfactorily without such an implication. I 
would reject this part of counsel's argument.


    But counsel had a stronger argument when he submitted 
that it is inherent in the word ""inflict"" that there must be a direct or 
indirect application of force to the body. Counsel cited the speech of Lord 
Roskill in 
Reg. v. Wilson (Clarence)
 [1984] A.C. 942, 259E-260H, in which 
Lord Roskill quoted with approval from the judgment of the full court of the 
Supreme Court of Victoria in 
Reg. v. Salisbury
 [1976] V.R. 452. There are 
passages that give assistance to counsel's argument. But Lord Roskill expressly 
stated (at p. 260H) that he was ""content to accept, as did the [court in 

Salisbury
] that there can be the infliction of grievous bodily harm 
contrary to section 20 without an assault being committed."" In the result the 
effect of the decisions in 
Wilson
 and 
Salisbury
 is neutral in 
respect of the issue as to the meaning of ""inflict."" Moreover, in 
Burstow
 
[1997] 1 Cr.App.R. 144, 149, the Lord Chief Justice pointed out that in 
Reg. 
v. Mandair
 [1995] 1 A.C. 208, 215, Lord Mackay of Clashfern L.C. observed 
with the agreement of the majority of the House of Lords: ""In my opinion . . . 
the word 'cause' is wider or at least not narrower than the word 'inflict'"". 
Like the Lord Chief Justice I regard this observation as making clear that in 
the context of the Act of 1861 there is no radical divergence between the 
meaning of the two words.


    That leaves the troublesome authority of the decision 
Court for Crown Cases Reserved in 
Reg. v. Clarence
 (1888) 22 Q.B.D. 23. 
At a time when the defendant knew that he was suffering from a venereal disease, 
and his wife was ignorant of his condition, he had sexual intercourse with her. 
He communicated the disease to her. The defendant was charged and convicted of 
inflicting grievous bodily harm under section 20. There was an appeal. By a 
majority of nine to four the court quashed the conviction. The case was 
complicated by an issue of consent. But it must be accepted that in a case where 
there was direct physical contact the majority ruled that the requirement of 
infliction was not satisfied. This decision has never been overruled. It assists 
counsel's argument. But it seems to me that what detracts from the weight to be 
given to the dicta in 
Clarence
 is that none of the judges in that case 
had before them the possibility of the inflicting, or causing, of psychiatric 
injury. The criminal law has moved on in the light of a developing understanding 
of the link between the body and psychiatric injury. In my judgment 

Clarence
 no longer assists.


    The problem is one of construction. The question is 
whether as a matter of current usage the contextual interpretation of ""inflict"" 
can embrace the idea of one person inflicting psychiatric injury on another. One 
can without straining the language in any way answer that question in the 
affirmative. I am not saying that the words cause and inflict are exactly 
synonymous. They are not. What I am saying is that in the context of the Act of 
1861 one can nowadays quite naturally speak of inflicting psychiatric injury. 
Moreover, there is internal contextual support in the statute for this view. It 
would be absurd to differentiate between sections 18 and 20 in the way argued on 
behalf of Burstow. As the Lord Chief Justice observed in 
Burstow
 [1997] 1 
Cr.App.R. 144, 149F, this should be a very practical area of the law. The 
interpretation and approach should so far as possible be adopted which treats 
the ladder of offences as a coherent body of law. Once the decision in 

Chan-Fook
 
[1994] 1 WLR 689
 is accepted the realistic possibility is opened up of prosecuting under 
section 20 in cases of the type which I described in the introduction to this 
judgment. 


    For the reasons I have given I would answer the 
certified question in 
Burstow
 in the affirmative. 


Reg. v. Ireland: Was there an assault?
 


    It is now necessary to consider whether the making of 
silent telephone calls causing psychiatric injury is capable of constituting an 
assault under section 47. The Court of Appeal, as constituted in 
Ireland
 
case, answered that question in the affirmative. There has been substantial 
academic criticism of the conclusion and reasoning in 
Ireland
: see 

Archbold News
, Issue 6, 12 July 1996; 
Archbold's Criminal Pleading, 
Evidence & Practice,
 (1995), Supplement No. 4 (1996), pp. 345-347; 

Smith and Hogan, Criminal Law
, 8th ed., 413; Herring, ""Assault by 
Telephone"" by Jonathan Herring [1997] C.L.J. 11; ""Assault"" [1997] Crim.L.R. 434, 
435-436. Counsel's arguments, broadly speaking, challenged the decision in 

Ireland
 on very similar lines. Having carefully considered the literature 
and counsel's arguments, I have come to the conclusion that the appeal ought to 
be dismissed. 


    The starting point must be that an assault is an 
ingredient of the offence under section 47. It is necessary to consider the two 
forms which an assault may take. The first is battery, which involves the 
unlawful application of force by the defendant upon the victim. Usually, section 
47 is used to prosecute in cases of this kind. The second form of assault is an 
act causing the victim to apprehend an imminent application of force upon her: 
see 
Fagan v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner
 [1969] 1 Q.B. 439, 444D-E. 



    One point can be disposed of, quite briefly. The 
Court of Appeal was not asked to consider whether silent telephone calls 
resulting in psychiatric injury is capable of constituting a battery. But 
encouraged by some academic comment it was raised before your Lordships' House. 
Counsel for Ireland was most economical in his argument on the point. I will try 
to match his economy of words. In my view it is not feasible to enlarge the 
generally accepted legal meaning of what is a battery to include the 
circumstances of a silent caller who causes psychiatric injury.


    It is to assault in the form of an act causing the 
victim to fear an immediate application of force to her that I must turn. 
Counsel argued that as a matter of law an assault can never be committed by 
words alone and therefore it cannot be committed by silence. The premise depends 
on the slenderest authority, namely, an observation by Holroyd J. to a jury that 
""no words or singing are equivalent to an assault"": 
Meade's
 and
 

Belt's
 case 1 (1823) 1 Lew. C.C. 184. The proposition that a gesture may 
amount to an assault, but that words can never suffice, is unrealistic and 
indefensible. A thing said is also a thing done. There is no reason why 
something said should be incapable of causing an apprehension of immediate 
personal violence, e.g. a man accosting a woman in a dark alley saying ""come 
with me or I will stab you."" I would, therefore, reject the proposition that an 
assault can never be committed by words.


    That brings me to the critical question whether a 
silent caller may be guilty of an assault. The answer to this question seems to 
me to be ""yes, depending on the facts."" It involves questions of fact within the 
province of the jury. After all, there is no reason why a telephone caller who 
says to a woman in a menacing way ""I will be at your door in a minute or two"" 
may not be guilty of an assault if he causes his victim to apprehend immediate 
personal violence. Take now the case of the silent caller. He intends by his 
silence to cause fear and he is so understood. The victim is assailed by 
uncertainty about his intentions. Fear may dominate her emotions, and it may be 
the fear that the caller's arrival at her door may be imminent. She may fear the 

possibility
 of immediate personal violence. As a matter of law the caller 
may be guilty of an assault: whether he is or not will depend on the 
circumstance and in particular on the impact of the caller's potentially 
menacing call or calls on the victim. Such a prosecution case under section 47 
may be fit to leave to the jury. And a trial judge may, depending on the 
circumstances, put a common sense consideration before jury, namely what, if not 
the possibility of imminent personal violence, was the victim terrified about? I 
conclude that an assault may be committed in the particular factual 
circumstances which I have envisaged. For this reason I reject the submission 
that as a matter of law a silent telephone caller cannot ever be guilty of an 
offence under section 47. In these circumstances no useful purpose would be 
served by answering the vague certified question in 
Ireland
.


    Having concluded that the legal arguments advanced on 
behalf of 
Ireland
 on section 47 must fail, I nevertheless accept that the 
concept of an assault involving immediate personal violence as an ingredient of 
the section 47 offence is a considerable complicating factor in bringing 
prosecutions under it in respect of silent telephone callers and stalkers. That 
the least serious of the ladder of offences is difficult to apply in such cases 
is unfortunate. At the hearing of the appeal of 
Ireland
 attention was 
drawn to the Bill which is annexed to Law Commission report, 
Legislating the 
Criminal Code: Offences Against the Person and General Principles,
 
Consultation Paper (Law Com. No. 218) (1993) (Cmnd 2370). Clause 4 of that Bill 
is intended to replace section 47. Clause 4 provides that ""A person is guilty of 
an offence if he intentionally or recklessly causes injury to another."" This 
simple and readily comprehensible provision would eliminate the problems 
inherent in section 47. In expressing this view I do not, however, wish to 
comment on the appropriateness of the definition of ""injury"" in clause 18 of the 
Bill, and in particular the provision that ""injury"" means ""impairment of a 
person's mental health."" 


The disposal of the appeals
 


    The legal arguments advanced on behalf of Burstow 
have failed. The appeal must be dismissed. 


    The legal arguments advanced on behalf of Ireland 
have also failed. But counsel for the appellant submitted that the appeal should 
be allowed because on an examination of the statements there was no prima facie 
case against him. I reject this submission. The prosecution case was never fully 
deployed because Ireland pleaded guilty. The fact of his plea demonstrated his 
mens rea. It was said, however, that the ingredient of psychiatric injury was 
not established on the statements. It is true that the statement from the 
psychiatrist is vague. But I would not accept that read in context it was 
insufficient to allow the case to go before a jury. It would be an exceptional 
course, in the face of an unequivocal and deliberate plea of guilty, to 
entertain an appeal directed exclusively to the sufficiency of evidence. Such a 
course is not warranted in the present case. I would therefore dismiss the 
appeal of Ireland. 




LORD HOPE OF CRAIGHEAD
 



My Lords, 


    I have had the advantage of reading in draft the 
speech which has been prepared by my noble and learned friend, Lord Steyn. I 
agree with it, and for the reasons which he gives I also would dismiss both 
appeals. I should like however to add a few words on the point which arises in 

Reg. v. Burstow
 as to the meaning of the word ""inflict"" in section 20 of 
the Offences against the Person Act 1861, and on the point which arises in 

Reg. v. Ireland
 as to whether the making of a series of silent telephone 
calls can amount in law to an assault within the meaning of section of section 
47 of that Act. 


Reg.
 
v.
 
Burstow
:
 ""
inflict
"" 


    In this case the appellant changed his plea to guilty 
after a ruling by the trial judge that the offence of unlawfully and maliciously 
inflicting grievous bodily harm contrary to section 20 of the Act of 1861 may be 
committed where no physical violence has been applied directly or indirectly to 
the body of the victim. Counsel for the appellant accepted that if 
Reg. v. 
Chan-Fook
 
[1994] 1 WLR 689
 was correctly decided, with the result that ""actual bodily harm"" in 
section 47 is capable of including psychiatric injury, the victim in this case 
had suffered grievous bodily harm within the meaning of section 20. But he 
submitted that no offence against section 20 had been committed in this case 
because, although the appellant might be said to have ""caused"" the victim to 
sustain grievous bodily harm, he had not ""inflicted"" that harm on her because he 
had not used any personal violence against her.


    Counsel based his submission on the decision in 

Reg. v. Clarence
 (1888) 22 Q.B.D. 23. In that case it was held that some 
form of direct personal violence was required for a conviction under section 20. 
The use of the word ""inflict"" in the section was said to imply that some form of 
battery was involved in the assault. The conviction was quashed because, 
although the venereal infection from which the victim was suffering was the 
result of direct physical contact, there had been no violence used and thus 
there was no element of battery. It seems to me however that there are three 
reasons for regarding that case as an uncertain guide to the question which 
arises where the bodily harm which has resulted from the defendant's conduct 
consists of psychiatric injury.


    The first is that the judges in 
Clarence 
were 
concerned with a case of physical, not psychiatric, injury. They did not have to 
consider the problem which arises where the grievous bodily harm is of a kind 
which may result without any form of physical contact. The second is that the 
intercourse had taken place with consent, as the defendant's wife was ignorant 
of his venereal disease. So there was no question in that case of an assault 
having been committed, if there was no element of violence or battery. Also, as 
Lord Roskill pointed out in 
Reg. v. Wilson (Clarence)
 [1984] A.C. 242, 
260C the judgments of the judges who formed the majority are not wholly 
consistent with each other. This casts some doubt on the weight which should be 
attached to the judgment when the facts are entirely different, as they are in 
the present case.


    In 
Reg. v. Wilson,
 Lord Roskill referred at 
pp. 259E-260B, with approval to the judgment of the Supreme Court of Victoria in 

Reg. v. Salisbury
 [1976] V.R. 452, in which the following passage 
appears, at p. 461: 


 "" . . . although the word 'inflicts' . . . does not have as wide a 
  meaning as the word 'causes' . . . the word 'inflicts' does have a wider 
  meaning than it would have if it were construed so that inflicting grievous 
  bodily harm always involved assaulting the victim."" 


At p. 260H Lord Roskill said that he was content to accept, as was the full 
court in 
Salisbury
, that there can be an infliction of grievous bodily 
harm contrary to section 20 without an assault being committed. But these 
observations do not wholly resolve the issue which arises in this case, in the 
context of grievous bodily harm which consists only of psychiatric injury.


    The question is whether there is any difference in 
meaning, in this context, between the word ""cause"" and the word ""inflict"". The 
fact that the word ""caused"" is used in section 18, whereas the word used in 
section 20 is ""inflict,"" might be taken at first sight to indicate that there is 
a difference. But for all practical purposes there is, in my opinion, no 
difference between these two words. In 
Reg. v. Mandair
 [1995] 1 A.C. 208, 
215B Lord Mackay of Clashfern L.C., said that the word ""cause"" is wider or at 
least not narrower than the word ""inflict."" I respectfully agree with that 
observation. But I would add that there is this difference, that the word 
""inflict"" implies that the consequence of the act is something which the victim 
is likely to find unpleasant or harmful. The relationship between cause and 
effect, when the word ""cause"" is used, is neutral. It may embrace pleasure as 
well as pain. The relationship when the word ""inflict"" is used is more precise, 
because it invariably implies detriment to the victim of some kind.


    In the context of a criminal act therefore the words 
""cause"" and ""inflict"" may be taken to be interchangeable. As the Supreme Court 
of Victoria held in 
Salisbury
 [1976] V.R. 452, it is not a necessary 
ingredient of the word ""inflict"" that whatever causes the harm must be applied 
directly to the victim. It may be applied indirectly, so long as the result is 
that the harm is caused by what has been done. In my opinion it is entirely 
consistent with the ordinary use of the word ""inflict"" in the English language 
to say that the appellant's actions ""inflicted"" the psychiatric harm from which 
the victim has admittedly suffered in this case. The issues which remain are 
issues of fact and, as the appellant pled guilty to the offence, I would dismiss 
his appeal. 


Reg. v. Ireland: ""assault""
 


    In this case the appellant pled guilty to three 
contraventions of section 47 of the Act of 1861. He admitted to having made 
numerous telephone calls to three women, during which he remained silent when 
the women answered the telephone. These calls lasted sometimes for a minute or 
so, and sometimes for several minutes. On some occasions they were repeated over 
a relatively short period. There is no doubt that this conduct was intended to 
distress the victims, each of whom suffered as a result from symptoms of such a 
kind as to amount to psychiatric injury. But, for the appellant to be guilty of 
an offence contrary to section 47 of the Act of 1861, he must be held to have 
committed an act which amounts to an assault.


    Plainly there was no element of battery --although 
counsel for the respondent made brief submissions to the contrary--as at no time 
was there any kind of physical contact between the appellant and his victims. As 
Swinton Thomas L.J. observed in the Court of Appeal [1997] Q.B. 114, 119D, that 
is a fact of importance in this case. But it is not an end of the matter, 
because as he went on to say it has been recognised for many centuries that 
putting a person in fear may amount to what in law is an assault. This is 
reflected in the meaning which is given to the word ""assault"" in 
Archbold 
Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice
 (1997), p. 1594 para. 19-66, namely 
that an assault is any act by which a person intentionally or recklessly causes 
another to apprehend immediate and unlawful violence. This meaning is well 
vouched by authority: see 
Reg. v. Venna
 
[1976] QB 421
; 
Reg. v. 
Savage 
[1992] 1 AC 699
, 
740F, 
per
 Lord Ackner.


    The question is whether such an act can include the 
making of a series of silent telephone calls. Counsel for the appellant said 
that such an act could not amount to an assault under any circumstances, just as 
words alone could not amount to an assault. He also submitted that, in order for 
there to be an assault, it had to be proved that what the victim apprehended was 
immediate and unlawful violence, not just a repetition of the telephone calls. 
It was not enough to show that merely that the victim was inconvenienced or 
afraid. He said that the Court of Appeal had fallen into error on this point, 
because they had proceeded on the basis that it was sufficient that when the 
victims lifted the telephone they were placed in immediate fear and suffered the 
consequences which resulted in psychiatric injury. The court had not 
sufficiently addressed the question whether the victims were apprehensive of 
immediate and unlawful violence and, if so, whether it was that apprehension 
which had caused them to sustain the bodily injury.


    I agree that a passage in the judgment of the Court 
of Appeal [1997] Q.B. 114, 122C-G suggests that they had equated the 
apprehension of immediate and unlawful violence with the actual psychiatric 
injury which was suffered by the victims. I also agree that, if this was so, it 
was an incorrect basis from which to proceed. But in the penultimate sentence in 
this passage Swinton Thomas L.J. said that in the court's judgment repetitive 
telephone calls of this nature were likely to cause the victim to apprehend 
immediate and unlawful violence. Furthermore, as the appellant pled guilty to 
these offences, the question whether that apprehension caused the psychiatric 
injury did not need to be explored in evidence. The important question therefore 
is whether the making of a series of silent telephone calls can amount in law to 
an assault.


    There is no clear guidance on this point either in 
the statute or in the authorities. On the one hand in 
Meade's and Belt's
 
case (1823) I Lew C.C. 184 Holroyd J. said that no words or singing can amount 
to an assault. On the other hand in 
Reg. v. Wilson
 [1955] 1 W.L.R. 493, 
494 Lord Goddard C.J. said that the appellant's words, ""Get out knives"" would 
itself be an assault. The word ""assault"" as used in section 47 of the Act of 
1861 is not defined anywhere in that Act. The legislation appears to have been 
framed on the basis that the words which it used were words which everyone would 
understand without further explanation. In this regard the fact that the statute 
was enacted in the middle of the last century is of no significance. The public 
interest, for whose benefit it was enacted, would not be served by construing 
the words in a narrow or technical way. The words used are ordinary English 
words, which can be given their ordinary meaning in the usage of the present 
day. They can take account of changing circumstances both as regards medical 
knowledge and the means by which one person can cause bodily harm to 
another.


    The fact is that the means by which a person of evil 
disposition may intentionally or recklessly cause another to apprehend immediate 
and unlawful violence will vary according to the circumstances. Just as it is 
not true to say that every blow which is struck is an assault--some blows, which 
would otherwise amount to battery, may be struck by accident or in jest or may 
otherwise be entirely justified--so also it is not true to say that mere words 
or gestures can never constitute an assault. It all depends on the 
circumstances. If the words or gestures are accompanied in their turn by 
gestures or by words which threaten immediate and unlawful violence, that will 
be sufficient for an assault. The words or gestures must be seen in their whole 
context.


    In this case the means which the appellant used to 
communicate with his victims was the telephone. While he remained silent, there 
can be no doubt that he was intentionally communicating with them as directly as 
if he was present with them in the same room. But whereas for him merely to 
remain silent with them in the same room, where they could see him and assess 
his demeanour, would have been unlikely to give rise to any feelings of 
apprehension on their part, his silence when using the telephone in calls made 
to them repeatedly was an act of an entirely different character. He was using 
his silence as a means of conveying a message to his victims. This was that he 
knew who and where they were, and that his purpose in making contact with them 
was as malicious as it was deliberate. In my opinion silent telephone calls of 
this nature are just as capable as words or gestures, said or made in the 
presence of the victim, of causing an apprehension of immediate and unlawful 
violence.

My Lords, 


    I have had the advantage of reading in draft the 
speech of my noble and learned friend, Lord Steyn. For the reasons which he 
gives I would dismiss the appeals. 


    Whether this requirement, and in particular that of 
immediacy, is in fact satisfied will depend on the circumstances. This will need 
in each case, if it is disputed, to be explored in evidence. But that step was 
not necessary in this case as the appellant was prepared to plead guilty to 
having committed the offence. I would therefore answer the certified question in 
the affirmative and dismiss this appeal also.",1997-07-24 00:00:00,UK House of Lords

LADY HALE AND LORD TOULSON: (with whom Lord Clarke and Lord Wilson agree)



	By these proceedings, a mother seeks to prevent a father from publishing a book about his life containing certain passages which she considers risk causing psychological harm to their son who is now aged 12. Mother and son now live in the United States of America and so the family court in England and Wales has no jurisdiction to grant orders protecting the child's welfare. Instead, these proceedings have been brought in his name, originally by his mother and now by his godfather as his litigation friend, alleging that publication would constitute a tort against him. The tort in question is that recognised in the case of 
Wilkinson v Downton 
[1897] 2 QB 57
 and generally known as intentionally causing physical or psychological harm. What, then, is the proper scope of the tort in the modern law? In particular, can it ever be used to prevent a person from publishing true information about himself?



 



	As the object of the proceedings has been to protect the child from harm, all the parties have until now been anonymous, as has the country where the child now lives. This court has decided that the tort does not have the scope contended for on the child's behalf and hence that the book may be published including the specific passages to which objection is taken. This means that the book will inevitably be published in the very near future. In those circumstances there can be no justification for keeping secret the information contained in the book. This includes, obviously, the author's name and also the country where mother and son are now living. The book, however, uses pseudonyms for both the mother and the child and so this judgment will continue to do so. But this court is now able to describe the book and its contents more fully than the lower courts were able to do. In this way, the reasons why both the mother and the father have been motivated to act as they have should become much clearer than perhaps they have been hitherto.



 



The book



	The father is James Rhodes, the concert pianist, author and television filmmaker. The book is entitled 
Instrumental
. The author believes that ""music has, quite literally saved my life and, I believe, the lives of countless others. It has provided company where there is none, understanding where there is confusion, comfort where there is distress, and sheer, unpolluted energy where there is a hollow shell of brokenness and fatigue"". He wants to communicate some of what music can do, by providing a sound track to the story of his life. ""And woven throughout is going to be my life story. Because it's a story that provides proof that music is the answer to the unanswerable. The basis for my conviction about that is that I would not exist, let alone exist productively, solidly – and, on occasion, happily – without music."" So the book juxtaposes descriptions of particular pieces of music, why he has chosen them, what they mean to him, and the composers who wrote them, with episodes of autobiography. He wants the reader to listen to the 20 music tracks while reading the chapters to which they relate.



 



	Thus far, there would be nothing for anyone to worry about. But the author's life has been a shocking one. And this is because, as he explains in the first of the passages to which exception is taken, ""I was used, fucked, broken, toyed with and violated from the age of six. Over and over for years and years"". In the second of those passages, he explains how he was groomed and abused by Mr Lee, the boxing coach at his first prep school, and how wrong it is to call what happened to him ""abuse"":



 



""Abuse. What a word. Rape is better. Abuse is when you tell a traffic warden to fuck off. It isn't abuse when a 40 year old man forces his cock inside a six-year-old boy's ass. That doesn't even come close to abuse. That is aggressive rape. It leads to multiple surgeries, scars (inside and out), tics, OCD, depression, suicidal ideation, vigorous self-harm, alcoholism, drug addiction, the most fucked-up of sexual hang-ups, gender confusion ('you look like a girl, are you sure you're not a little girl?'), sexuality confusion, paranoia, mistrust, compulsive lying, eating disorders, PTSD, DID (the shinier name for multiple personality disorder) and so on and on and on.



I went, literally overnight, from a dancing, spinning, gigglingly alive kid who was enjoying the safety and adventure of a new school, to a walled-off, cement shoed, lights-out automaton. It was immediate and shocking, like happily walking down a sunny path and suddenly having a trapdoor open and dump you into a freezing cold lake.



You want to know how to rip the child out of a child? Fuck him.



Fuck him repeatedly. Hit him. Hold him down and shove things inside him. Tell him things about himself that can only be true in the youngest of minds before logic and reason are fully formed and they will take hold of him and become an integral, unquestioned part of his being.""



	He describes how he learnt to dissociate himself from what was happening, to block it out of his memory, how when he moved to other schools he had learnt to offer sexual favours to older boys and teachers in return for sweets and other treats. He gives a searing account of the physical harms he suffered as a result of the years of rape and of the psychological effects, which made it hard for him to form relationships and left him with an enduring sense of shame and self-loathing.



 



	He recounts the ups and downs of his adult life: a year at Edinburgh University filled with drugs and alcohol, leading to his first admission to a psychiatric hospital; a year working and sobering up in Paris; three years studying psychology at University College London, leading to a highly successful career as a salesman in financial publishing; meeting and marrying the mother, whom he calls Jane, an American novelist then living in London; making a ""perfect home"" with her. He is kind about his wife – ""The poor thing didn't stand a chance"" – and hard upon himself:



 



""I've honestly no idea what I was thinking, beyond that rather sad hope that if I continued to do what normal people did then I would somehow become normal. But the idea that a man like me could not only get married, but maintain, nurture, commit to a marriage was fucking ridiculous. My whole concept of love was skewed.""



	Then their child, whom he calls Jack, was born: ""My son was and is a miracle. There is nothing I will experience in my life that will ever match the incandescent atomic bomb of love which exploded in me when he was born."" He wanted to be a perfect father, but ""I don't think that I will ever be able to make my peace with the fact that the ripples of my past became tidal waves when he was born"". His past had installed ""an unshakeable belief that all children suffer through childhood in the most abominable ways and that nothing and no-one can protect them from it"". Eventually, he looked for professional help from a charity specialising in helping victims of child sexual abuse and was told that he must tell his wife about the abuse. So he did. Their child was then four years old. ""It is, apparently, very common for the world to spin completely off its axis when your child approaches the age you were when the abuse began"".



 



	Instead of returning to drink and drugs he resorted to self-harm: ""That's the thing about cutting – not only do you get high, but you can express your disgust at yourself and the world, control the pain yourself, enjoy the ritual, the endorphins, the seedy, gritty self-violence privately and hurt no-one other than yourself"". But his wife found out and he was persuaded to go into hospital again. Among the passages which have not been challenged is a graphic account of the effect of the psychotropic drugs which he was forced to take in hospital. He tried to commit suicide, escaped from the hospital, planned a second attempt at suicide but rang his wife for a last word with his son, and was persuaded to meet her. So he was returned to hospital. He worked hard at being a model patient so that he could be let out. But it was not a cure. ""Even out of hospital, off meds, physically present for my family, I was a ghost."" A friend offered him a life-line, treatment in a hospital in the United States, where he spent two months. ""By the end of it I had, miraculously, stopped hating myself quite so much. I'd put on weight, cleared away a lot of the wreckage of the past, repaired some relationships and found a way to live with myself that, most days, left me relatively calm and composed."" There is a moving passage about rebuilding his relationship with his son: ""That's the weird thing about kids – they have a capacity for forgiveness that most adults can only aspire to. He has always loved me – it was inbuilt and immutable – and I him. After a few weeks of playing, singing, hanging out, we felt absolutely connected and back to normal.""



 



	But the marriage could not be repaired. Mother and father agreed to a trial separation and he moved out. Things ""started to get more and more wobbly"", not helped by his going to the police for the first time in the hope of exorcising some of the past horrors, where he found the process ""brutal, shaming, vile"". He began self-harming once more. Eventually, the mother decided to move back to the United States. Once again, he is generous: ""She had, understandably and justifiably, had enough. There had been so much destruction, so much uncertainty and pain, and clearly Jane had decided that Jack's needs had to come first. She was a mother first and foremost and not some patron saint of lost causes."" They got into a routine. He would go over there twice a year, she would bring him over here twice a year, they would Skype twice a week.



 



	Interwoven with this painful story is the story of his relationship with music. He discovered music, specifically, Bach's Chaconne for solo violin in D minor, transcribed for piano by Busoni, while still at the preparatory school where he was being so brutally abused:



 



""… that piece became my safe place. Any time I felt anxious (any time I was awake) it was going round in my head. Its rhythms were being tapped out, its voices played again and again, altered, explored, experimented with. I dove inside it as if it were some kind of musical maze and wandered around happily lost. It set me up for life; without it I would have died years ago, I've no doubt. But with it, and with all the other music that it led me to discover, it acted like a force field that only the most toxic and brutal pain could penetrate.""



	At his next preparatory school he largely taught himself to read music and play the piano. At Harrow, he had his first proper teacher, who was ""awesome"". He discovered that ""literally the only thing in the universe I realised I wanted was to travel the world, alone, playing the piano in concert halls"". Then he gave it up during the ten years of university, building a career and getting married. But after his son was born and the demons returned, ""I looked for distractions. I looked for a way out that didn't involve homicide or suicide"". He found it in music. He set about building a business partnership with the agent of ""the greatest pianist in the world"", but was persuaded instead to train as a pianist himself. He worked hard. And when he had begun to resort to self-harm, he decided to organise his first public concert. He rented a hall on the South Bank, the hall was filled, and the concert went well: ""I realise that all those fantasies about giving concerts that I had as a kid, that kept me alive and safe in my head, were accurate. It really is that powerful. And I knew I wanted to do it forever. No matter what"".



 



	Then the suicidal ideas and attempts and hospitalisation took over. But a friend visiting him in hospital brought him an iPod nano loaded with music inside a giant bottle of shampoo (toiletries being the only gifts allowed). Once again music was his salvation. It persuaded him to do what he needed to do to get out. After separating from his wife, he started to get more involved in the piano again. And in a café he met the man who was to become his manager. Together they arranged for him to record his first CD, 
Razor Blades, Little Pills and Big Pianos
. He found a sponsor to enable him to concentrate on his music. He did a documentary about Chopin for the BBC. His manager arranged concerts at the Roundhouse and the Queen Elizabeth Hall. Together they devised a new sort of concert, in which the pianist talked about the music, the composer and what it meant to him, in an informal way quite unlike the usual classical music concert. It was a success. Through his manager he met the woman who was to become his second wife.



 



	The concerts led to some press interest, including an interview with the Sunday Times in which he mentioned the abuse which had happened at school. This prompted the head of the junior school in his first school, who had known that something was wrong but not what it was, to get in touch and to provide a police statement. Mr Lee was found, still coaching small boys boxing, and prosecuted. But he died before he could stand trial:



 



""Maybe one day I will forgive Mr Lee. That's much likelier to happen if I find a way to forgive myself. But the truth, for me at any rate, is that the sexual abuse of children rarely, if ever, ends in forgiveness. It leads only to self-blame, visceral, self-directed rage and shame …



But shining a light on topics like this is hugely important. And getting hundreds of supportive and grateful messages from people who had also gone through similar experiences was an indicator to me that it needs to be talked about even more.""



	From then his career went from strength to strength. There have been many concerts, all over the world. There have been four more albums. There was a television series for Sky Arts, 
Piano Man
. There was even talk, though it came to nothing, of his appearing in the Royal Variety Show. He and his manager had found a new and different way of presenting classical music to the world and it worked.



 



	There have been bad times since as well as good times – ""Sadly I am only ever two weeks away from a locked ward"" – but the overall message is one of hope:



 



""I lost my childhood but gained a child. I lost a marriage but gained a soulmate. I lost my way but gained a career and a fourth or fifth chance at a life which is second to none.""



These proceedings



	During their divorce, the mother and father agreed to include the following recital, recital K, in a residence and contact order made in London on 15 June 2009:



 



""And upon the parties agreeing to use their best endeavours to protect the child from any information concerning the past previous history of either parent which would have a detrimental effect upon the child's well-being""



	A first draft of the book was sent to the publishers in December 2013. In February 2014 it was leaked to the mother and some changes were made as a result, including the use of pseudonyms for mother and child. The mother did not consider that those changes had gone far enough. In June 2014, she launched these proceedings on behalf of the child, claiming against the father and the publishers an injunction prohibiting publication without the deletion of a large number of passages. The causes of action alleged were misuse of private information, negligence and the intentional infliction of harm. An anonymity order was made at the same time, prohibiting the publication of any information which might lead to the identification of the child as a party to the proceedings or the subject of the information to which the proceedings related. All parties have since filed evidence but there have been no findings on the factual matters in dispute.



 



	The mother has filed a report from Dr Christine Tizzard, a consultant child psychologist who interviewed the child in June 2014. Her opinion was that he ""is likely to suffer severe emotional distress and psychological harm in the event that he is exposed to the material in the publication"". The child has been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, dyspraxia and dysgraphia. He qualifies for an Individualised Educational Program in the United States and receives specialist support and counselling. In her view, the information in the book would be inappropriate for any 11 year old child to read and have access to, but it would be even more devastating for this child, because of his difficulties in processing information: his psychological schemas are not malleable, he receives information in a literal way and is unable to conceptualise it in an alternative way, and he would view himself as responsible for some of his father's distress and an extension of his father. He is already prone to self-harm and emotional outbursts and these would probably increase.



 



	Both parties accept that it is most unlikely that the child will come into possession of the book itself. The publishers plan to publish it in hard copy in the UK and much of the rest of the English-speaking world, and to retail it in shops and on-line, but there are no plans at present to publish it in the USA. It will also be available for purchase as an e-book.



 



	The father accepts that knowing what happened to him would upset and embarrass the child, but not that it will be harmful if dealt with in the right way and at the right time. The bare bones of his story have already appeared in articles and interviews which are available on-line. The mother is concerned that the child who is proud of his father, has ""googled"" him in the past. If he did so in future he would be likely to come across reviews and references to the book.



 



	The application for an interim injunction came before Bean J in private in July 2014. His judgment has not been published. He dismissed the application and struck the proceedings out on the basis that the child had no cause of action in tort against the father or the publishers. He said that there was no precedent for an order preventing a person from publishing their life story for fear of its causing psychiatric harm to a vulnerable person, nor should there be. He held that a cause of action under 
Wilkinson v Downton 
did not extend beyond false or threatening words.



 



	The child's appeal was heard in August 2014 and judgment given in October: 
[2014] EWCA Civ 1277
. The Court of Appeal held that there was no claim in misuse of private information or in negligence, but that the claim for intentionally causing harm should go for trial. The factual issues would be the father's intention in publishing the book, the level of harm which the child was likely to suffer and the cause of such harm.



 



	The leading judgment was given by Arden LJ. She held that the action under 
Wilkinson v Downton 
was not limited to false or intimidatory statements, but she considered other ways in which the tort might be kept within acceptable limits. She said that it was ""inconceivable that the law would render all intentional statements which cause psychiatric harm actionable in damages. In some cases a person may have to tell bad news which is liable to cause psychiatric harm. But there may be many ways in which the court could draw the line between acceptable intentional statements or acts which cause psychiatric harm, and those which are actionable under this head"" (para 68). She added (para 69) that it had to be shown that the act was unjustified ""in the sense that the defendant was not entitled to do it 
vis-à-vis the particular claimant
"" (original emphasis). Thus she met the objection that many disturbing publications may foreseeably cause psychiatric harm to someone of sufficient vulnerability by treating the cause of action as confined to the person at whom the act was directed, and therefore the question of justification was similarly confined. Arden LJ had noted at the outset of her judgment that the book was dedicated to the child, and the fact that the father had ""accepted a responsibility to use his best endeavours to ensure that OPO is protected from harmful information"" was sufficient in her judgment ""to mean that there is no justification for his words, if they are likely to produce psychiatric harm"".



 



	As to the mental element of the tort, Arden LJ held that the necessary intent to cause harm could be imputed to the father, since he was aware of the psychiatric evidence about the harm which his son would be likely suffer if he read some of the contents of the book. She said, correctly, that there was a consistent line of authority from 
Wilkinson v Downton
 that even if a person did not intend to cause such harm, an intent to do so could be imputed to him if that was the likely consequence.



 



	In a short concurring judgment Jackson LJ said that for a statement to give rise to liability under 
Wilkinson v Downton
 it need not be false. Rather, it must meet the essential characteristics that ""the statement is unjustified and that the defendant intends to cause or is reckless about causing physical or psychiatric injury to the claimant"". Jackson LJ considered that the following facts were sufficient to establish that the claimant had a good prospect of success for the purposes of granting an interlocutory injunction:



 



i)	The book contained graphic descriptions of the abuse which the appellant had suffered and his incidents of self-harm.



ii)	Those passages were likely to be quoted by reviewers or newspapers who serialised the book.



iii)	On the uncontradicted expert evidence those passages were likely to cause psychological harm to the claimant.



iv)	The book was dedicated to the claimant and partly addressed to him.



v)	The appellant knew of the risks posed to the claimant because of his vulnerabilities and had for that reason subscribed to Recital K.



McFarlane LJ agreed with both judgments. The form of order was the subject of a supplemental judgment after a further hearing in private.



	The court granted an interim injunction, restraining the defendants from making ""generally available to the public by any means all or any part of the information referred to in Confidential Schedule 2 to this Order ('the information') whether by publishing the particular extracts identified in Confidential Schedule 3 or by publishing any substantially similar words to like effect"". Confidential Schedule 2 reads thus:



 



""
Information referred to in the Order



(1) The information or purported information that the respondents intended to publish in a book entitled 'Instrumental' ('the Book') (extracts of which are particularised in Confidential Schedule 3) which give graphic accounts of the First defendant's account of sexual abuse he suffered as a child; his suicidal thoughts and attempts; his history of and treatment for mental illness and incidents of self-harming; his thoughts about killing the appellant; his fears that the appellant would also be a victim of sexual abuse and linking this account to the appellant.



(2) Any information liable to or which might lead to the identification of the appellant (whether directly or indirectly) as the subject of these proceedings or the material referred to above.""



	In the judgment about the form of order Arden LJ emphasised the use of word ""graphic"" in the order, which she explained as follows:



 



""We take the word ""graphic"" to mean vividly descriptive. In judging what is vividly descriptive, we have borne in mind that the person to be protected is a vulnerable child. In these circumstances, we consider that what should be injuncted is that which we consider to be seriously liable to being understood by a child as vividly descriptive so as to be disturbing.""



	Confidential Schedule 3 contains some 40 extracts from the book. Some fall within the general description in Confidential Schedule 2 as explained by Arden LJ and some do not. By no means all the passages in the book which might be thought to fall within that general description are included. Nowhere in the listed extracts or in the current version of the book is there mention of thoughts about killing the child. Some of the quotations in paras 3 to 15 above are among the 40 extracts listed; many are not.



 



	The prohibition does not relate to information contained in the book apart from the Confidential Schedules or contained in the public judgment of the court. Nor does it apply to any material which had been placed in the public domain before 1 September 2014 and either appeared on the internet in the father's name in a form and on a site accessible at 1 September 2014 or was attributed to the father and contained in a national television programme transmitted in England within the previous 12 months.



 



	The trial of the action was listed for April 2015. The father and the publishers contend that on the agreed facts the child has no cause of action against them.



 



Wilkinson v Downton



	Mr Downton secured a place for himself in legal history by a misconceived practical joke. He thought that it would be a cause of harmless amusement among the clientele of the Albion public house in Limehouse to tell the landlord's wife, Mrs Wilkinson, a false tale that her husband had fractured his legs in an accident while on his way back from a race meeting and that he had sent a message to ask for her help to get him home. It cost her 1 shilling and 10 ½ pence to send her son and another helper on this fools' errand, but a matter of far greater concern was the effect on her health. She suffered severe shock to her nervous system, which manifested itself in vomiting and weeks of physical suffering. Mrs Wilkinson had not shown any previous sign of predisposition to nervous shock. She and her husband sued Mr Downton, and the matter came to trial before Wright J and a jury.



 



	Recovery of the transport costs incurred in response to Mr Wilkinson's supposed request for help presented no legal difficulty. Such costs were recoverable as damages for deceit. The jury assessed damages for the illness caused to Mrs Wilkinson by her nervous shock (together with her husband's claim for the resulting loss of her services) at £100, but the legal basis for making such an award was problematic.



 



	Wright J rejected the argument that damages for deceit could include an award for Mrs Wilkinson's suffering, because the essence of liability for deceit was that a maker of a false representation, intended to be acted upon, was liable to make good any loss naturally resulting from the representee acting on it, but the illness suffered by Mrs Wilkinson was not a consequence of her acting on what she was told. It was simply a consequence of the shock brought about by the news reported to her.



 



	Wright J held, at pp 58-59, that a cause of action could be stated in law where a defendant has



 



""wilfully done an act calculated to cause physical harm to the plaintiff – that is to say, to infringe her legal right to personal safety, and has in fact thereby caused physical harm to her.""



He continued



""That proposition without more appears to me to state a good cause of action, there being no justification alleged for the act. This wilful injuria is in law malicious, although no malicious purpose to cause the harm which was caused nor any motive of spite is imputed to the defendant.""



	This compact statement of law contained a number of key features. First, he identified the plaintiff's protected interest as her ""legal right to personal safety"". Secondly, he identified the defendant's act as wilful. Thirdly, he described the act as ""calculated"" to cause physical harm to the plaintiff. Fourthly, he noted the absence of any alleged justification. Fifthly, he characterised the ""wilful injuria"" as ""in law malicious"" despite the absence of any purpose (ie desire) to cause the harm which was caused. Having stated the law in that way, Wright J then considered whether it covered Mrs Wilkinson's claim. He held that it did. He said:



 



""One question is whether the defendant's act was so plainly calculated to produce some effect of the kind which was produced that an intention to produce it ought to be imputed to the defendant, regard being had to the fact that the effect was produced on a person proved to be in an ordinary state of health and mind. I think that it was. It is difficult to imagine that such a statement, made suddenly and with apparent seriousness, could fail to produce grave effects under the circumstances upon any but an exceptionally indifferent person, and therefore an intention to produce such an effect must be imputed …""



	This passage removes any doubt that Wright J was using the word ""calculated"" in the sense of likely to have an effect of the kind which was produced, and that the result was taken in law to be intended by a process of imputation.



 



	The work of modern scholars is helpful to understanding Wright J's judgment by placing it in its historical context. The latter part of the 19
th
 century was a formative period in the law of tort, as in other areas of the common law. There was a movement towards general principles of liability for intentional or ""malicious"" torts, as there was also for negligence. (See Professor Oliphant's chapter, 
The Structure of the Intentional Torts
, in 
Emerging Issues in Tort Law
, 2007, edited by Professor Neyers and others.) The first edition of 
Pollock on Torts 
was published in 1887. In it he began his discussion of principles by stating it as ""a general proposition of English law that it is a wrong to do wilful harm to one's neighbour without lawful justification"" (p 21). He acknowledged that this was a modern principle for which there was no express authority, but he reasoned that as the modern law of negligence enforced the duty of fellow-citizens to observe in varying circumstances an appropriate measure of prudence to avoid causing harm to one another, ""much more must there exist, whether it be so expressed in the books or not, the negative duty of not doing wilful harm; subject, as all general duties must be subject, to the necessary exceptions"" (p 22). In later editions he cited an obiter dictum of Bowen LJ in 
Skinner & Co v Shew & Co
 [1893] 1 Ch 413, 422 that at common law there was a cause of action ""whenever one person did damage to another wilfully and intentionally, and without just cause or excuse"". Wright J was familiar with 
Pollock on Torts
 and he referred to the 4
th
 edition in 
Wilkinson v Downton
 at p 60.



 



	The word ""maliciously"" was much used both in the law of tort and in criminal law. In the famous case of 
Mogul Steamship Co Ltd v McGregor, Gow & Co
 (in which the plaintiffs complained about being kept out of the conference of shipowners trading between China and London) Bowen LJ said that the word had an ""accurate meaning, well known to the law"" as well as a ""popular and less precise signification"". As a legal term it meant ""an intention to do an act which is wrongful, to the detriment of another"": (1889) 23 QBD 598, 612. He continued, at p 613:



 



""Now, intentionally to do that which is calculated in the ordinary course of events to damage, and which does, in fact, damage another in that other person's property or trade, is actionable if done without just cause or excuse. Such intentional action when done without just cause or excuse is what the law calls a malicious wrong (see 
Bromage v Prosser
 
(1825) 4 B & C 247
; 
Capital and Counties Bank v Henty
 (1882) 7 App Cas 741, 772, per Lord Blackburn).""



In 
Bromage v Prosser
 Bayley J distinguished ""malice in law"", inferred from the defendant's intentional interference with the plaintiff's rights, from ""malice in fact"" (p 255). In the 
Mogul Steamship
 case Bowen LJ held that the defendants had just cause to act as they did, because they were free to carry on their trade freely to their best advantage, and the House of Lords agreed [1892] AC 25.



	Just as absence of actual ill-will was not a defence if the defendant's act wilfully interfered with an interest of the plaintiff which carried a right to legal protection, conversely the existence of ill-will was held not to be enough to create a cause of action in the absence of such a right. This was the ratio decidendi in the celebrated case of 
Mayor of Bradford v Pickles
 
[1895] AC 587
, from which it followed that insofar as Bowen LJ suggested that any act of interference with another's trade was 
prima facie
 unlawful his dictum was too wide. The chief source of water supplied for the citizens of Bradford was a collection of springs on land owned by the corporation at the foot of a hillside on the outskirts of the city. Above that land was a tract owned by Mr Pickles, and the springs were fed by water flowing underground from Mr Pickles's land. Mr Pickles embarked on the work of sinking a shaft on his land which had the effect of altering the flow of water and reducing the volume which fed the springs. The corporation brought proceedings for an injunction to restrain him from doing the work. The pleader alleged that he was acting ""maliciously"". It was argued that he was not acting for the improvement of his own land, but that he simply intended to deprive the corporation of water which it would otherwise have received, with the motive of forcing it to buy him out at a price satisfactory to himself. The corporation was granted an interim injunction at first instance, but the injunction was set aside by the Court of Appeal (Lord Herschell, LC, and Lindley and AL Smith LJJ, [1895] 1 Ch 145) and the Court of Appeal's judgment was upheld by the House of Lords. It was held that Mr Pickles had acted throughout in accordance with his legal rights. The corporation had no legal right to the flow of water from his land and, that being so, his motives were irrelevant. Lord Halsbury LC said at p 594:



 



""This is not a case in which the state of mind of the person doing the act can affect the right to do it. If it was a lawful act, however ill the motive might be, he had a right to do it. If it was an unlawful act, however good his motive might be, he would have no right to do it. Motives and intentions in such a question as is now before your Lordships seem to me to be absolutely irrelevant.""



	All this would have been familiar to Wright J. Shortly before he gave judgment in 
Wilkinson v Downton
 he had been summoned with other judges to give his opinion to the House of Lords in the famous case of 
Allen v Flood
 [1898] AC 1. He delivered his judgment in 
Wilkinson v Downton
 on 8 May 1897 and his opinion in 
Allen v Flood 
on 3 June 1897. In his opinion in 
Allen v Flood
, at [1898] AC 63, he said that in circumstances where:



 



""there was not otherwise any wrong or injuria, it follows that there could not be malice in the ordinary legal sense of that term, as compendiously stating the wilful infringement of a legal right or breach of a legal duty without matter of legal justification or excuse: upon which may be cited 
Bromage v Prosser 
[and other authorities].



These and other authorities show that in general wherever the term 'malice' or 'maliciously' forms part of a statement of a cause of action or of a crime, it imports not an inference of motive to be found by the jury, but a conclusion of law which follows on a finding that the defendant has violated a right and has done so knowingly, unless he shows some overriding justification.""



	Lord Herschell said in his judgment in 
Allen v Flood
 at p 124:



 



""More than one of the learned judges who were summoned refers with approval to the definition of malice by Bayley J in the case of 
Bromage v Prosser
: 'Malice in common acceptation of the term means ill-will against a person, but in its legal sense it means a wrongful act done intentionally without just cause or excuse.' It will be observed that this definition eliminates motive altogether.""



	It is interesting to compare and contrast Wright J's opinion in 
Allen v Flood 
with his judgment in 
Wilkinson v Downton
. In his opinion in 
Allen v Flood
 Wright J made the point (as the House of Lords had held in 
Mayor of Bradford v Pickles
) that if the defendant's conduct did not interfere with any right of the plaintiff, malice in its popular meaning would not be enough to create a wrong or injuria. But in 
Wilkinson v Downton
 he treated the defendant's wilfulness in telling a deliberate falsehood as an element of the injuria. The two approaches were not incompatible, for it is perfectly possible for the law to recognise an interest deserving some form of legal protection, but to require an appropriate degree of fault for an interference with it to constitute a legal injuria; the appropriate fault element may vary, typically between negligence and intention (although they are not the only possibilities); and the measure of protection provided by the law may vary as between different types of interest (be it a person's property, trade or personal safety). In 
Wilkinson v Downton
 Wright J identified the plaintiff's protected interest as her right to personal safety. There may be good reasons of social policy for the law to treat a person who deliberately does something which causes another to suffer physical or psychological injury or illness by telling them a false story (
Wilkinson v Downton
) more harshly than one who carelessly passes on false information.



 



	In the passage cited above from his opinion in 
Allen v Flood
, Wright J referred to cases where ""malice … forms part of a statement of a cause of action or of a crime"". In relation to the criminal law, Professor Mark Lunney has drawn attention in an illuminating article, 
Practical joking and its penalty: Wilkinson v Downton in context
 (2002) 10 Tort Law Review 168, 178, to the decision of the Court of Crown Cases Reserved in 
R v Martin
 (1881) 8 QBD 54. The defendant caused panic in a theatre by barricading an exit door and extinguishing the gas lighting. In the resulting confusion several people were seriously injured. His conduct was intended as a prank, but any sane person would have realised that it was dangerous. The court upheld his conviction for unlawfully and maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm, contrary to section 20 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. Lord Coleridge CJ said (at p 58):



 



""The prisoner must be taken to have intended the natural consequences of that which he did. He acted 'unlawfully and maliciously', not that he had any personal malice against the particular individuals injured, but in the sense of doing an unlawful act calculated to injure …""



Stephen J said (also at p 58) that:



""if the prisoner did that which he did as a mere piece of foolish mischief unlawfully and without excuse, he did it 'wilfully', that is, 'maliciously', within the meaning of the statute.""



	There is a striking parallel between the language and reasoning in 
R v Martin
 and in 
Wilkinson v Downton
. Wright J's proposition that the ""injuria"" was ""in law malicious"", despite the absence of any ""malicious purpose"" or ""motive of spite"" contained a clear echo of the criminal law.



 



	Historically the doctrine of imputed intention, that is to say that a person is to be taken as a matter of law to intend the natural and probable consequences of his acts, survived in the criminal law as late as the decision of the House of Lords in 
DPP v Smith
 [1961] AC 290. The decision surprised most criminal lawyers and was described by Professor Glanville Williams in his 
Textbook of the Criminal Law
, (1
st
 ed) (1978), p 61, as ""the most criticised judgment ever to be delivered by an English court"". The doctrine was abolished by section 8 of the Criminal Justice Act 1967. This states:



 



""A court or jury, in determining whether a person has committed an offence, -



(a)	shall not be bound in law to infer that he intended or foresaw a result of his actions by reason only of its being a natural and probable consequence of those actions; but



(b)	shall decide whether he did intend or foresee that result by reference to all the evidence, drawing such inferences from the evidence as appear proper in the circumstances.""



	The final matter which Wright J addressed in his judgment in 
Wilkinson v Downton
 was whether the effect on Mrs Wilkinson of the report about her husband ""was, to use the ordinary phrase, too remote to be regarded in law as a consequence for which the defendant is answerable"". Having expressed the view that it was difficult to imagine that such a report could fail to produce grave effects, unsurprisingly he said that apart from authority he would hold that it was not too remote. He then considered two authorities advanced for the proposition that ""illness through mental shock is a too remote or unnatural consequence of an injuria to entitle the plaintiff to recover in a case where damage is a necessary part of the cause of action"": 
Victorian Railways Commissioners v Coultas
 (1888) 13 App Cas 222 and 
Allsop v Allsop
 
(1860) 5 H & N 534
, approved by the House of Lords in 
Lynch v Knight
 (1861) 
9 HL Cas 577
.



 



	In 
Victorian Railways Commissioners v Coultas
 the plaintiff narrowly escaped serious injury at a level crossing. She was a passenger in a buggy driven by her brother. The gate keeper negligently opened the gates for them to cross when a train was approaching. There was no collision, but the plaintiff was found by a jury to have suffered illness as a result of the shock of seeing the train approaching and thinking that they were going to be killed. The Privy Council held that mere sudden terror unaccompanied by actual physical injury could not in such circumstances be considered a consequence which in the ordinary course would flow from the negligence of the gate keeper.



 



	Wright J declined to follow that authority. He observed that it had been doubted by the Court of Appeal (
Pugh v London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Co
 [1896] 2 QB 248, 250, per Lord Esher MR) and had been rejected in Ireland (
Bell v Great Northern Railway Co of Ireland 
(1890) 26 LR Ir 428, per Palles CB) and by the Supreme Court of New York (
Mitchell v Rochester Railway Co
 (1896) 151 NY Rep 107, cited by Pollock). He did not go further and express the view that it was wrong, but it was unnecessary for him to do so, for he also described the case as not in point since ""there was not in that case any element of wilful wrong"".



 



	
Allsop v Allsop
 was a case of illness allegedly caused by a slanderous imputation of unchastity to a married woman. The woman heard the slander at third hand. It was held that the woman could not claim special damages for her illness in an action for slander against the originator of the slander. Wright J took a narrow view of the case as an authority on the type of damages recoverable in an action for slander. He said that to adopt it as a rule of general application that illness resulting from a false statement could never give rise to a claim for damages would be difficult or impossible to defend.



 



	Wright J's essential reasoning is clear, once the terms that he used are properly understood. He did not attempt to define physical harm of a psychiatric nature, but on the facts it was unnecessary for him to say more than he did. We have analysed his reasoning at some length because of the uncertainty to which it has given rise.



 



Subsequent case law



	
Wilkinson v Downton
 has been a source of much discussion and debate in legal textbooks and academic articles but seldom invoked in practice. This may be due to the development of the law of negligence in the area of recognised illness resulting from nervous shock. But a distinctive feature of the present case is that the courts below have held that there is no arguable case against the father in negligence (applying 
Barrett v Enfield London Borough Council
 
[2001] 2 AC 550
), and the claimant has therefore been constrained to rely on 
Wilkinson v Downton
.



 



	
Wilkinson v Downton
 was considered by the Divisional Court (Kennedy and Phillimore JJ) in 
Dulieu v White
 
& Sons
 
[1901] 2 KB 669
. The plaintiff was working behind the bar at the Bonner Arms in Bethnal Green when an employee of the defendant negligently drove a horse drawn van into the room where she was. She was pregnant at the time and claimed damages for illness allegedly resulting from her severe shock. The defendant pleaded that the damages claimed were too remote. The issue came before the Divisional Court on a demurrer. The court rejected the defence and declined to follow 
Victorian Railways Commissioners v Coultas
. The judges observed that the decision of the Privy Council was entitled to great respect but was no more binding on the court than it was on the Exchequer Division in Ireland. Kennedy J put to one side cases of wilful wrong-doing, such as 
Wilkinson v Downton
, as perhaps involving special considerations. In cases of negligence, he said that he was inclined to limit liability to injury from shock arising from a reasonable fear of immediate personal injury to oneself. Phillimore J, at p 683, said that he agreed with the decision of Wright J in 
Wilkinson v Downton
 ""that everyone has a right to his personal safety, and that it is a tort to destroy this safety by wilfully false statements and thereby to cause a physical injury to the sufferer"". From that and other authorities he drew the principle that ""terror wrongfully induced and inducing physical mischief gives a cause of action"".



 



	
Wilkinson v Downton
 was approved by the Court of Appeal in 
Janvier v Sweeney
 [1919] 2 KB 316. The plaintiff was a French woman engaged to a German who was interned in the Isle of Man during World War 1. She lived as the paid companion of another woman who had a house in Mayfair. The defendants were an ex-police officer who ran a private detective agency and his assistant. The first defendant wanted to inspect surreptitiously some letters written to the plaintiff's employer. In July 1917 he sent his assistant to see the plaintiff and trick her into cooperating by pretending that he was a police officer and that she was suspected of corresponding with a German spy. She claimed that this caused her to suffer severe shock resulting in a period of nervous illness. She sued for damages and won.



 



	On the appeal it was conceded that the threatening conduct found by the jury would amount to an actionable wrong if damage which the law recognised could be shown to have flowed directly from it. But it was argued that the plaintiff's illness was too remote in law and that 
Wilkinson v Downton
 was wrongly decided. The court approved the reasoning of Wright J and the statement of Phillimore J in 
Dulieu v White
 that ""terror wrongfully induced and inducing physical mischief gives a cause of action"". Duke LJ described 
Janvier v Sweeney
 as a stronger case than 
Wilkinson v Downton
 because there was an intention to terrify the plaintiff for the purpose of attaining an unlawful object.



 



	There appear to have been no reported cases in this country on 
Wilkinson v Downton
 for the next 70 years or so. In the last 25 years it has had a modest resurgence in the context of harassment: 
Khorasandjian v Bush
 
[1993] QB 727
; 
Wong v Parkside Health NHS Trust
 
[2001] EWCA Civ 1721
, 
[2003] 3 All ER 932
; 
Wainwright v Home Office
 
[2001] EWCA Civ 2081
, 
[2002] QB 1334
 (CA), 
[2003] UKHL 53
, 
[2004] 2 AC 406
 (HL).



 



	In 
Khorasandjian v Bush
 the plaintiff obtained an injunction, in reliance on 
Wilkinson v Downton
 and 
Janvier v Sweeney
, to prevent a former partner from making threatening phone calls. Dillon LJ (with whom Rose LJ agreed) described those authorities as establishing that ""false words or verbal threats calculated to cause, uttered with the knowledge that they are likely to cause, and actually causing physical injury to the person to whom they are uttered are actionable"" (p 735). (This was a direct quotation from the headnote in 
Janvier v Sweeney
.) Dillon LJ interpreted injury in the sense of ""recognisable psychiatric illness with or without psychosomatic symptoms"", as distinct from ""mere emotional distress"" (p 736).



 



	In 
Wong v Parkside Health NHS Trust
 the claimant sued her former employer for post-traumatic stress resulting from alleged harassment at her place of work. Hale LJ, giving the judgment of the court, said that it followed from Wright J's formulation in 
Wilkinson v Downton
 that although the tort is commonly labelled ""intentional infliction of harm"", it was not necessary to prove actual (subjective) intention to injure; it was sufficient to prove that the conduct was ""calculated"" to do so in the sense of being deliberate conduct which was likely in the nature of things to cause injury (para 10). As explained above, Hale LJ was correct that this was indeed the effect of Wright J's formulation, which the Court of Appeal endorsed in 
Janvier v Sweeney
. Whether it should be endorsed by this court is a different question. Hale LJ also confirmed the view expressed in 
Khorasandjian v Bush
 that for liability to arise under 
Wilkinson v Downton
 there must be ""physical harm or recognised psychiatric illness"". The interesting question is whether it should be sufficient to establish conduct intended to cause severe alarm or distress falling short of a recognised psychiatric illness but in fact causing the latter. This question was touched on in 
Wainwright v Home Office
.



 



	In 
Wainwright v Home Office
 a young adult who suffered from cerebral palsy and severe arrested social and intellectual development was wrongly subjected by prison officers to a strip search, which was carried out in a particularly humiliating fashion. He was greatly distressed by the episode and was subsequently diagnosed as suffering post-traumatic stress disorder. He claimed damages under 
Wilkinson v Downton
. It was argued on his behalf that the ambit of harm covered by the tort should extend beyond cases of recognised physical or psychiatric injury and should include distress of the kind which was the natural consequence of the prison officers' treatment of him.



 



	In the Court of Appeal Lord Woolf CJ said that he had no difficulty with the statement in 
Salmond & Heuston on Torts
, (21
st
 ed) (1996), p 215, that ""one who by extreme and outrageous conduct intentionally or recklessly causes severe emotional distress to another is liable for such emotional distress, provided that bodily harm results from it"": 
[2002] QB 1334
, para 49. (This statement was taken from the 
American Law Institute, Restatement of the Law, Torts,
 (2
nd 
ed) (1965), section 46.) But the trial judge had not made any finding that there was such intention or recklessness, and for that reason Lord Woolf held that the claim failed.



 



	Buxton LJ agreed that the claim failed on the facts, but he disagreed with the formulation in 
Salmond & Heuston
. He considered that the headnote in 
Janvier v Sweeney
, adopted by Dillon LJ in 
Khorasandjian v Bush
, came ""as close as it is possible to do to a general statement of the rule in 
Wilkinson v Downton
"" (para 79). But if that was not correct, he held that the rule must be limited to Wright J's statement that the defendant's act was so clearly likely to produce an effect of the kind that occurred that an intention to produce it should be imputed to him (objective recklessness). The reformulation in 
Khorasandjian v Bush
 required subjective recklessness as to the causation of physical injury in the sense of recognisable psychiatric distress. Intention or recklessness merely as to severe emotional distress, from which bodily harm happened to result, was not enough. Buxton LJ regarded the court in 
Wong's 
case as treating the two formulations as equivalent in their effect.



 



	In the House of Lords the principal judgment was given by Lord Hoffmann. His analysis of 
Wilkinson v Downton
 was that Wright J was prevented by the decision of the Privy Council in 
Victorian Railway Commissioners v Coultas
 from finding in negligence, and Wright J devised a concept of imputed intention which sailed as close to negligence as he felt that he could; that it was not entirely clear what he meant by finding that the defendant intended to cause injury; but that by the time of 
Janvier v Sweeney
 the law was able comfortably to accommodate the facts of 
Wilkinson v Downton
, since the court in 
Dulieu v White
 had declined to follow 
Victorian Railway Commissioners v Coultas
. (See paras 44, 37 and 39 to 40.)



 



	This interesting reconstruction shows the pitfalls of interpreting a decision more than a century earlier without a full understanding of jurisprudence and common legal terminology of the earlier period. The concept of imputed intention was certainly not a novel concept devised by Wright J to get around a perceived stumbling block in the law of negligence. The concept was in the mainstream of legal thinking at that time. Moreover there is no reason for supposing that Wright J would have felt obliged to follow the decision of the Privy Council unless he could find a means of distinguishing it. He pointed out that it had been doubted by the Court of Appeal, was inconsistent with a decision of the Court of Appeal in Ireland and had been criticised in the USA and by Pollock. Just as Kennedy and Phillimore JJ said in 
Dulieu v White
 that they were not bound by the decision of the Privy Council, Wright J would have known that he was not bound to follow it as a matter of precedent (and respect for it would have been reduced by the comments of the eminent judges, Lord Esher and Palles, CB, who had either doubted it or judged it to be wrong). There is no reason to suppose that Wright J was being artful when he described the Privy Council's decision as not in point because it did not involve wilful wrongdoing. His reasoning may seem unclear to modern readers, but it would not have been unclear to those familiar at the time with his use of the terms ""malicious"", ""calculated"" and ""imputed"".



 



	It is also incorrect to suggest that after 
Dulieu v White
 the law would have comfortably accommodated the facts of 
Wilkinson v Downton
 within the law of nervous shock caused by negligence. Kennedy J's judgment in 
Dulieu v White
 would have limited a cause of action in negligence for damages for nervous shock to cases in which the nervous shock resulted from fear for the plaintiff's own personal safety, which would not have included Mrs Wilkinson's case, since her fear was for her husband. This limitation was disapproved by a majority of the Court of Appeal in 
Hambrook v Stokes Brothers 
[1925] 1 KB 141 (Sargant LJ dissenting) and was finally put to rest in 
McLoughlin v O'Brian
 
[1983] 1 AC 410
. In any event negligence and intent are very different fault elements and there are principled reasons for differentiating between the bases (and possible extent) of liability for causing personal injury in either case.



 



	Lord Hoffmann rejected the argument on behalf of Mr Wainwright that there should be liability under 
Wilkinson v Downton
 for distress, not amounting to recognised psychiatric injury, on the basis of imputed intent. He said at para 45:



 



""If … one is going to draw a principled distinction which justifies abandoning the rule that damages for mere distress are not recoverable, imputed intention will not do. The defendant must actually have acted in a way which he knew to be unjustifiable and either intended to cause harm or at least acted without caring whether he caused harm or not.""



	Lord Hoffmann said that he read Lord Woolf's judgment as suggesting a willingness to accept such a principle, but that the facts did not support it. As we read Lord Woolf's judgment, the proposition from 
Salmond & Heuston 
which he was willing to accept was slightly different. It was that damages should be recoverable only in cases where the claimant suffered recognised bodily or psychiatric injury (and not mere emotional distress), but that in order to be entitled to damages for such injury it should be sufficient to show that the injury resulted from severe emotional distress which was intentionally or recklessly caused by the defendant's outrageous conduct.



 



	Lord Hoffmann was open to the idea that compensation should be available in cases where there was a genuine intention to cause distress, but he added a strong note of caution. He observed that in institutions and workplaces all over the country, people constantly say and do things with the intention of causing distress and humiliation to others. ""This"", he said at para 46, ""shows lack of consideration and appalling manners but I am not sure that the right way to deal with it is always by litigation"". He referred also to the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, which provides a remedy in damages for a course of conduct amounting to harassment. He observed that the requirement of a course of conduct showed that Parliament was conscious that it might not be in the public interest to allow the law to be set in motion for one ""boorish"" incident, and that it might be that any development of the common law should show similar caution (para 46).



 



	Lord Hoffmann concluded that 
Wilkinson v Downton
 as an authority did not provide a remedy for distress falling short of recognised psychiatric injury, and that in so far as there might be a remedy for distress (without psychiatric injury) intentionally caused, the necessary intention was not established (para 47).



 



Other common law jurisdictions



	Most common law jurisdictions have adopted 
Wilkinson v Downton
. In Australia it was cited with approval by the High Court in 
Bunyan v Jordan
 
(1937) 57 CLR 1
. Despite some later cases in which the courts have tended to treat it as subsumed within the law of negligence, Spigelman CJ in the New South Wales Court of Appeal treated it as an intentional tort in 
Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Naidu
 
[2007] NSWCA 377
, paras 71-72. It has also been followed in New Zealand (
Stevenson v Basham
 [1922] NZLR 225; 
Bradley v Wingnut Films Ltd
 [1993] 1 NZLR 415), Ireland (
Sullivan v Boylan
 
[2013] IEHC 104
) and Hong Kong (
Wong Kwai Fun v Li Fung
 [1994] 1 HKC 549). In the USA and Canada there has been significant further development.



 



	The American Law Institute's 
Restatement of the Law: Torts
 (2
nd 
ed) (1965), section 46(1) stated:



 



""One who by extreme and outrageous conduct intentionally or recklessly causes severe emotional distress to another is subject to liability for such emotional distress, and if bodily harm to the other results from it, for such bodily harm.""



45 states accepted this definition and others adopted a modified version of it. (See R Fraker, ""
Reformulating Outrage: a critical analysis of the problematic tort of IEED
"" (2008) 61 Vand L Rev 983.) In the 
Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for Physical and Emotional Harm
 (2012) the wording of section 46 is marginally different but the meaning is unchanged:



""An actor who by extreme and outrageous conduct intentionally or recklessly causes severe emotional harm to another is subject to liability for that emotional harm and, if the emotional harm causes bodily harm, also for the bodily harm.""



The commentary to the current version states:



""The outrage tort originated as a catchall to permit recovery in the narrow instance when an actor's conduct exceeded all permissible bounds of a civilized society but an existing tort claim was unavailable. This tort potentially encompasses a broad swath of behaviour and can easily, but often inappropriately, be added as a supplement to a suit in which the gravamen is another tort or a statutory violation. The intent requirement is satisfied when an actor knows that conduct is substantially certain to cause harm. Because emotional harm is often a predictable outcome of otherwise legitimate conduct, such as terminating an employee, liability for this tort could be expansive. Courts have played an especially critical role in cabining this tort by requiring 'extreme and outrageous' conduct and ""severe"" emotional harm. A great deal of conduct may cause emotional harm, but the requisite conduct for this claim – extreme and outrageous – describes a very small slice of human behaviour.  The requirement that the resulting harm be severe further limits claims. These limits are essential in preventing this tort from being so broad as to intrude on important countervailing policies, while permitting its judicious use for the occasions when it is appropriate.""



	In Canada it is settled law that ""The tort of intentional infliction of mental distress or shock has three elements: (1) an act or statement … that is extreme, flagrant or outrageous; (2) the act or statement is calculated to produce harm; and (3) the act or statement causes harm"" (
High
 
Parklane Consulting Inc v Lewis
 
2007 CanLII 410
, para 31, per Perell J). This three-limbed test is derived from a line of earlier authorities including particularly the decision of McLachlin J, sitting as she then was in the British Columbia Supreme Court, in 
Rahemtulla v Vanfed Credit Union
 [1984] 3 WWR 296. In that case the plaintiff was harassed at work, falsely accused of theft in threatening circumstances and summarily dismissed without proper cause in a humiliating fashion. The defendant submitted that to be liable for wilful infliction of nervous shock its conduct must be outrageous. McLachlin J said, at para 52:



 



""This submission appears to be founded on the distinction drawn in American cases between mere insult, which is not actionable, and 'extreme and outrageous conduct' which is: 
Linden: Canadian Tort Law
 (3
rd
 ed) (1982), p 48. While this distinction appears not to have been expressly adopted in the Canadian and Commonwealth cases, the conduct considered in the leading authorities such as 
Wilkinson v Downton
, and 
Janvier v Sweeney
, was in fact flagrant and extreme. Moreover, it is difficult to accept that the courts should protect persons from every practical joke or unkind comment.""



	McLachlin J said that ""assuming"" that only flagrant and extreme conduct inflicting mental suffering was actionable, the defendant's conduct could be so described. She identified the two further ingredients of the tort as being: that the conduct was ""plainly calculated to produce some effect of the kind which was produced"" (quoting from Wright J's judgment in 
Wilkinson v Downton
), and that the conduct produced provable illness. She found that the conduct was ""plainly calculated"" to cause profound distress because it was clearly foreseeable. Since that decision the courts have followed the approach of imputing the necessary intention where severe emotional distress was foreseeable (see Professor Denise Réaume's chapter, 
The Role of Intention in the Tort in Wilkinson v Downton
, in 
Emerging Issues in Tort Law
).



 



Analysis



	The order made by the Court of Appeal was novel in two respects. The material which the appellant was banned from publishing was not deceptive or intimidatory but autobiographical; and the ban was principally directed, not to the substance of the autobiographical material, but to the vivid form of language used to communicate it. The appeal therefore raises important questions about freedom of speech and about the nature and limits of liability under 
Wilkinson v Downton
.



 



	In 
Wilkinson v Downton
 Wright J recognised that wilful infringement of the right to personal safety was a tort. It has three elements: a conduct element, a mental element and a consequence element. The issues in this case relate to the first and second elements. It is common ground that the consequence required for liability is physical harm or recognised psychiatric illness. In 
Wainwright v Home Office
 Lord Hoffmann discussed and left open (with expressions of caution) the question whether intentional causation of severe distress might be actionable, but no one in this case has suggested that it is.



 



	The conduct element requires words or conduct directed towards the claimant for which there is no justification or reasonable excuse, and the burden of proof is on the claimant. We are concerned in this case with the curtailment of freedom of speech, which gives rise to its own particular considerations. We agree with the approach of the Court of Appeal in regarding the tort as confined to those towards whom the relevant words or conduct were directed, but they may be a group. A person who shouts ""fire"" in a cinema, when there is no fire, is addressing himself to the audience. In the present case the Court of Appeal treated the publication of the book as conduct directed towards the claimant and considered that the question of justification had therefore to be judged vis-à-vis him. In this respect we consider that they erred.



 



	The book is for a wide audience and the question of justification has to be considered accordingly, not in relation to the claimant in isolation. In point of fact, the father's case is that although the book is dedicated to the claimant, he would not expect him to see it until he is much older. Arden LJ said that the father could not be heard to say that he did not intend the book to reach the child, since it was dedicated to him and some parts of it are addressed to him. We have only found one passage addressed to him, which is in the acknowledgments, but more fundamentally we do not understand why the appellant may not be heard to say that the book is not intended for his eyes at this stage of his life. Arden LJ also held that there could be no justification for the publication if it was likely to cause psychiatric harm to him. That approach excluded consideration of the wider question of justification based on the legitimate interest of the defendant in telling his story to the world at large in the way in which he wishes to tell it, and the corresponding interest of the public in hearing his story.



 



	When those factors are taken into account, as they must be, the only proper conclusion is that there is every justification for the publication. A person who has suffered in the way that the appellant has suffered, and has struggled to cope with the consequences of his suffering in the way that he has struggled, has the right to tell the world about it. And there is a corresponding public interest in others being able to listen to his life story in all its searing detail. Of course vulnerable children need to be protected as far as reasonably practicable from exposure to material which would harm them, but the right way of doing so is not to expand 
Wilkinson v Downton
 to ban the publication of a work of general interest. But in pointing out the general interest attaching to this publication, we do not mean to suggest that there needs to be some identifiable general interest in the subject matter of a publication for it to be justified within the meaning of 
Wilkinson v Downton
.



 



	Freedom to report the truth is a basic right to which the law gives a very high level of protection. (See, for example, 
Napier v Pressdram Ltd
 
[2009] EWCA Civ 443
, 
[2010] 1 WLR 934
, para 42.) It is difficult to envisage any circumstances in which speech which is not deceptive, threatening or possibly abusive, could give rise to liability in tort for wilful infringement of another's right to personal safety. The right to report the truth is justification in itself. That is not to say that the right of disclosure is absolute, for a person may owe a duty to treat information as private or confidential. But there is no general law prohibiting the publication of facts which will cause distress to another, even if that is the person's intention. The question whether (and, if so, in what circumstances) liability under 
Wilkinson v Downton
 might arise from words which are not deceptive or threatening, but are abusive, has not so far arisen and does not arise for consideration in this case.



 



	The Court of Appeal recognised that the appellant had a right to tell his story, but they held for the purposes of an interlocutory injunction that it was arguably unjustifiable for him to do so in graphic language. The injunction permits publication of the book only in a bowdlerised version. This presents problems both as a matter of principle and in the form of the injunction. As to the former, the book's revelation of what it meant to the appellant to undergo his experience of abuse as a child, and how it has continued to affect him throughout his life, is communicated through the brutal language which he uses. His writing contains dark descriptions of emotional hell, self-hatred and rage, as can be seen in the extracts which we have set out. The reader gains an insight into his pain but also his resilience and achievements. To lighten the darkness would reduce its effect. The court has taken editorial control over the manner in which the appellant's story is expressed. A right to convey information to the public carries with it a right to choose the language in which it is expressed in order to convey the information most effectively. (See

	The problem with the form of the injunction is that Schedule 2 defines the information which it is forbidden to publish not only by reference to its substantive content, but also by the descriptive quality of being ""graphic"". What is sufficiently ""graphic"" to fall within the ban is a matter of impression. The amplification of ""graphic"" in the court's supplementary judgment as meaning ""seriously liable to being understood by a child as vividly descriptive so as to be disturbing"" similarly lacks the clarity and certainty which an injunction properly requires. Any injunction must be framed in terms sufficiently specific to leave no uncertainty about what the affected person is or is not allowed to do. The principle has been stated in many cases and nowhere more clearly than by Lord Nicholls in 
Attorney General v Punch Ltd 
[2002] UKHL 50
, 
[2003] 1 AC 1046
 at para 35:



 



""An interlocutory injunction, like any other injunction, must be expressed in terms which are clear and certain. The injunction must define precisely what acts are prohibited. The court must ensure that the language of its order makes plain what is permitted and what is prohibited. This is a well established, soundly-based principle. A person should not be put at risk of being in contempt of court by an ambiguous prohibition, or a prohibition the scope of which is obviously open to dispute.""



	Our conclusion that the publication of the appellant's book is not within the scope of the conduct element of the tort is enough to decide this case. However, the issue of the mental element required for the tort has been argued before us and it is right that we should address it. The Court of Appeal found that the necessary intention could be imputed to the appellant. The court cannot be criticised for doing so, since it was bound by previous decisions of the court which upheld that approach (in particular, 
Janvier v Sweeney
 and 
Wong v Parkside Health NHS Trust
).



 



	There is a critical difference, not always recognised in the authorities, between imputing the existence of an intention as a matter of law and inferring the existence of an intention as a matter of fact. Imputation of an intention by operation of a rule of law is a vestige of a previous age and has no proper role in the modern law of tort. It is unsound in principle. It was abolished in the criminal law nearly 50 years ago and its continued survival in the tort of wilful infringement of the right to personal safety is unjustifiable. It required the intervention of Parliament to expunge it from the criminal law, but that was only because of the retrograde decision in 
DPP v Smith
. The doctrine was created by the courts and it is high time now for this court to declare its demise.



 



	The abolition of imputed intent clears the way to proper consideration of two important questions about the mental element of this particular tort.



 



	First, where a recognised psychiatric illness is the product of severe mental or emotional distress, a) is it necessary that the defendant should have intended to cause illness or b) is it sufficient that he intended to cause severe distress which in fact results in recognisable illness? Option b) is close to the version stated by 
Salmond & Heuston
 which attracted Lord Woolf in 
Wainwright v Home Office
.



 



	Secondly, is recklessness sufficient and, if so, how is recklessness to be defined for this purpose? Recklessness is a word capable of different shades of meaning. In everyday usage it may include thoughtlessness about the likely consequences in circumstances where there is an obvious high risk, or in other words gross negligence. In 
R v G
 
[2003] UKHL 50
, 
[2004] 1 AC 1034
, the House of Lords construed ""recklessly"" in the Criminal Damage Act 1971 as meaning that ""A person acts recklessly … with respect to … a result when he is aware of a risk that it will occur; and it is, in the circumstances known to him, unreasonable to take the risk"". The House of Lords based its interpretation on the definition proposed by the Law Commission in clause 18(c) of the Criminal Code Bill annexed to its Report on Criminal Law: A Criminal Code for England and Wales and Draft Criminal Code Bill, Vol 1 (Law Com No 177, 1989). A similar definition of recklessness was included in a draft Bill for reforming the law of offences against the person, which the Government published in 1998 but did not take forward. The Law Commission has repeated its proposal in a scoping consultation paper on Reform of Offences against the Person (LCCP 217, 2015). The exact wording of its proposed definition is:



 



""A person acts recklessly with respect to a result if he is aware of a risk that it will occur and it is unreasonable to take that risk having regard to the circumstances as he knows or believes them to be.""



	In thinking about these questions it is pertinent to consider the practical implications. Suppose that a hostage taker demands money from the family of the hostage (H) for his safe release, or that a blackmailer threatens harm to a person unless the family of the victim (V) meets his demands. The wife or parent of H or V suffers severe distress causing them to develop a recognised psychiatric illness. We doubt that anyone would dispute that in those circumstances the hostage taker or blackmailer ought to be held liable for the consequences of his evil conduct. There would be no difficulty in inferring as a matter of fact that he intended to cause severe distress to the claimant; it was the means of trying to achieve his demand. But the wrongdoer may not have had the intention to cause psychiatric illness, and he may well have given no thought to its likelihood.



 



	Compare that scenario with an example at the other end of the spectrum. The defendant has a dispute with his neighbour. Tempers become flared and he makes a deliberately insulting remark. He intends it to be upsetting, but he does not anticipate or intend that the neighbour will suffer severe emotional distress. Unfortunately the episode and in particular the insult have that effect, and the distress leads to a recognised form of psychiatric illness. It would be disproportionate to hold the defendant liable when he never intended to cause the neighbour to be seriously upset.



 



	Our answer to the first question is that of option (b) (para 83 above). Our answer to the second question is not to include recklessness in the definition of the mental element. To hold that the necessary mental element is intention to cause physical harm or severe mental or emotional distress strikes a just balance. It would lead to liability in the examples in para 85 but not in the example in para 86. It means that a person who actually intends to cause another to suffer severe mental or emotional distress (which should not be understated) bears the risk of legal liability if the deliberately inflicted severe distress causes the other to suffer a recognised psychiatric illness. A loose analogy may be drawn with the ""egg shell skull"" doctrine, which has an established place in the law of tort. This formulation of the mental element is preferable to including recklessness as an alternative to intention. Recklessness was not a term used in 
Wilkinson v Downton
 or 
Janvier v Sweeney
 and it presents problems of definition. The Law Commission's definition would be clear, but it would not cover the example of the hostage taker or the blackmailer, because it would require proof of actual foresight of the risk of the claimant suffering psychiatric illness.



 



	It would be possible to limit liability for the tort to cases in which the defendant's conduct was ""extreme, flagrant or outrageous"", as in Canada. But this argument has not so far been advanced in this country, and, although Arden LJ adverted to it as a possibility, the appellant has not sought to pursue it. We are inclined to the view, which is necessarily obiter, that the tort is sufficiently contained by the combination of a) the conduct element requiring words or conduct directed at the claimant for which there is no justification or excuse, b) the mental element requiring an intention to cause at least severe mental or emotional distress, and c) the consequence element requiring physical harm or recognised psychiatric illness.



 



	In the present case there is no basis for supposing that the appellant has an actual intention to cause psychiatric harm or severe mental or emotional distress to the claimant.



 



	We conclude that there is no arguable case that the publication of the book would constitute the requisite conduct element of the tort or that the appellant has the requisite mental element. On both grounds the appeal must be allowed and the order of Bean J restored.



 



LORD NEUBERGER: (with whom Lord Wilson agrees)



	I agree that this appeal should be allowed for the reasons given by Lady Hale and Lord Toulson. Because the issue involved is of importance and could raise some points of difficulty in other cases, I add some remarks of my own.



 



	There are various familiar circumstances in which a defendant can be liable to a claimant as a result of a statement made by the defendant. Examples include a statement which is unlawful statutorily, a breach of contract, defamatory, a breach of duty because of a pre-existing relationship, and a statement which amounts to misuse of information or a breach of the claimant's confidence, copyright, or right to privacy. This appeal concerns the circumstances in which a claimant has a cause of action for distress or psychiatric illness which he suffers as a result of a statement made by the defendant, where the statement would not otherwise give rise to a claim. It is a fundamental issue, and, particularly given the importance attached to both freedom of expression and human dignity, it can raise questions which are difficult to resolve. Having said that, the answer to the question whether there is a valid claim in the present case appears to me to be quite plain.



 



	The facts of this case are fully set out by Lady Hale and Lord Toulson in paras 1-30 above. I agree that the interlocutory injunction granted by the Court of Appeal was flawed for two reasons. First, there should have been no injunction at all, because the claimant's claim to restrain publication of the defendant's book had no prospects of success. Secondly, the terms of the injunction were flawed both conceptually and procedurally.



 



	The claimant's claim had no prospects of success because publication of the defendant's book would plainly not have given rise to a cause of action in his favour. It is true that the claimant is the defendant's son and is psychologically vulnerable, and it was argued in the Court of Appeal that this relationship gave rise to a duty of care on the part of the defendant which publication of the book would breach. However, as the Court of Appeal rightly held, that argument cannot assist the claimant in this case – see the reasoning of Arden LJ at 
[2014] EWCA Civ 1277
, paras 48-57, upholding the conclusion of Bean J at first instance on this aspect. There is, rightly, no appeal on that ground.



 



	Once that ground is disposed of, it appears to me that the book's contents simply have nothing to do with the claimant, at least from a legal perspective. The book describes the defendant's searing experiences of sexual abuse as a boy and its consequential effects. It is true, that the book is dedicated to the claimant and it expresses fears about the claimant being at risk of abuse as a child, but the furthest that that point could go would be to negative the idea that the defendant could have been unaware of the fact that the contents of the book would come to the claimant's attention at some point (which was unsurprisingly not in issue anyway).



 



	While I agree that many people would regard the book as being in some respects in the public interest, it is not necessary to decide this appeal on that ground. Unless it is necessary to do so, I am unenthusiastic about deciding whether a book, or any other work, should be published by reference to a judge's assessment of the importance of the publication to the public or even to the writer. In the present case, I do not consider that it would make any difference if the experiences which the defendant describes could be shown to have been invented, or if the book had been written as a novel by someone who had not been sexually abused. It is true that the book contained material which some people might find offensive, in terms of what was described and how it was expressed, but ""free speech includes not only the inoffensive but the irritating, the contentious, the eccentric, the heretical, the unwelcome and the provocative provided it does not tend to provoke violence"" – see 
Redmond-Bate v Director of Public Prosecutions 
 
7 BHRC 375
, para 20, per Sedley LJ. As he memorably added, ""[f]reedom only to speak inoffensively is not worth having"".



 



	Quite apart from this, it would, I think, be an inappropriate restriction on freedom of expression, an unacceptable form of judicial censorship, if a court could restrain publication of a book written by a defendant, whose contents could otherwise be freely promulgated, only refer in general and unobjectionable terms to the claimant, and are neither intended nor expected by the defendant to harm the claimant, simply because the claimant might suffer psychological harm if he got to read it (or extracts from it). Whatever the nature and ingredients of the tort whose origin can be traced to 
Wilkinson v Downton 
[1897] 2 QB 57
, it therefore cannot possibly apply in this case. And that, at least in a narrow sense, is in my view the beginning and the end of this case.



 



	As to the terms of the injunction, the Court of Appeal accepted that the defendant should be entitled to describe the ordeals which he had undergone. However, they decided that he could not publish certain specified passages in his book or any other accounts of his ordeals in so far as those accounts were ""graphic"", a description which was explained by Arden LJ as meaning ""seriously liable to being understood by a child as vividly descriptive so as to be disturbing"".



 



	There are two problems with such a form of injunction. First, it treats the terms in which events are described in the book as detachable from the inclusion of the events themselves. Freedom of expression extends not merely to what is said but also to how it is said. Whether a communication is made orally or in writing, the manner or style in which it is expressed can have a very substantial effect on what is actually conveyed to the listener or reader. One cannot realistically detach style from content in law any more than one can do so in literature or linguistic philosophy. I agree with what is said in para 78 above in this connection.



 



	The second problem with the form of injunction granted by the Court of Appeal is that it is insufficiently specific, and in that connection there is nothing which I wish to add to what is said in para 79 above.



 



	It would not, however, be right to leave matters there, in the light of the decision in 
Wilkinson 
(on which the Court of Appeal relied) and the subsequent cases in this and other common law jurisdictions, discussed by Lady Hale and Lord Toulson in paras 51-71 above. In 
Wilkinson
, the defendant was held liable to a plaintiff for severe mental distress caused to her by an untrue statement, which was misconceivedly intended as a cruel joke, namely that her husband had suffered serious injuries in an accident. The way in which the trial judge, Wright J, expressed himself in his judgment must, like all statements, be seen in its context, and that context is illuminatingly explained in paras 34-50 above. Given that there was a valid claim in that case and there is none in this case, it raises the question as to the characterisation of the tort in question, which could perhaps be characterised as the tort of making distressing statements.



 



The tort has been identified as ""terror wrongfully induced and inducing physical mischief"" (see 
Dulieu v White & Sons 
[1901] 2 KB 669
, 683 and 
Janvier v Sweeney 
[1919] 2 KB 316, 322). However, I am not happy with that characterisation, as it lumps together physical actions and statements, it begs the question by the use of the word ""wrongful"", and it is limited to ""terror"", and, as explained below, I would leave open whether ""physical mischief"" is a necessary ingredient.


 



While I would certainly accept that an action not otherwise tortious which causes a claimant distress could give rise to a cause of action, I would be reluctant to decide definitively that liability for distressing actions and distressing words should be subject to the same rules, at this stage at any rate. There is of course a substantial overlap between words and actions: after all, words can threaten or promise actions, and freedom of expression can in some respects extend to actions as well as words. And, in the light of what I say below, it might be the case that the tort of making distressing statements is to be limited to statements which are the verbal equivalent of physical assaults. However, there are relevant differences between words and actions. The reasons for a difference in legal treatment between liability for actions and liability for words were identified by Lord Reid, Lord Devlin and Lord Pearce in 
Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd 
[1964] AC 465
, 482-483, 516-519 and 534 respectively.


 



	In order to decide when a statement, which is not otherwise tortious, and which causes a claimant distress, should be capable of founding a cause of action, it is necessary to bear in mind five points, some of which are in tension. First, that there must be circumstances in which such a cause of action should exist: the facts of 
Wilkinson 
and 
Janvier 
make that point good. Secondly, given the importance of freedom of expression, which includes the need to avoid constraining ordinary (even much offensive) discourse, it is vital that the boundaries of the cause of action are relatively narrow. Thirdly, because of the importance of legal certainty, particularly in the area of what people can say, the tort should be defined as clearly as possible. Fourthly, in the light of the almost literally infinite permutations of possible human interactions, it is realistic to proceed on the basis that it may well be that no set of parameters can be devised which would cater for absolutely every possibility. Fifthly, given all these factors, there will almost inevitably be aspects of the parameters on which it would be wrong to express a concluded view, and to let the law develop in a characteristic common law way, namely on a case by case basis.



 



	In other words, the tort exists, and should be defined narrowly and as clearly as possible, but it would be dangerous to say categorically that each ingredient of the tort must always be present. Nonetheless, it seems to me that it is worth identifying what are, at least normally, and hopefully almost always, the essential ingredients of the tort.



 



	
Wilkinson 
and 
Janvier 
were cases where the statement made by the defendant was untrue, gratuitous, intended to distress the plaintiff, directed at the plaintiff, and caused the plaintiff serious distress amounting to psychiatric illness. Clearly, where all these ingredients are present, the tort would be established, but the question is whether they are all strictly required.



 



	First, if it is possible at all, it will be a very rare case where a statement which is not untrue could give rise to a claim, save, perhaps where the statement was a threat or (possibly) an insult.



 



	Sometimes, a threat will be unlawful anyway: for instance a threat of immediate assault or a blackmail. In some cases there is statutory liability for an offensive statement. Thus, a statement may be covered by the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 (as amended) which provides for both civil remedies (section 3) and criminal liability (sections 2, 2A, 4, 4A). Similarly Part IV of the Family Law Act 1996 (as amended) allows a court to make an order to protect an individual from molestation, and provides that the breach of such an order is a criminal offence. Harassment requires a course of action, so I do not think that a one-off statement could be caught by the 1997 Act. Section 4A of the Public Order Act 1986 (added by the Public Order Act 1994) provides that it is an offence to use ""threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour"" which causes ""harassment, alarm or distress"" and which is intended to have that effect. However, section 4A only creates a criminal offence, and it does not apply where the words are used ""by a person inside a dwelling and the person who is harassed, alarmed or distressed is also inside that or another dwelling"". Further, section 1 of the Malicious Communications Act 1988 criminalises communications which are ""grossly offensive"", ""a threat"" or ""known … to be false"" if at least one of the purposes is to ""cause distress or anxiety"", unless the sender had ""reasonable grounds"", but it does not appear to give rise to civil liability. And section 127 of the Communications Act 2003 criminalises electronic sending of ""grossly offensive"" or ""menacing"" messages, or ""false"" messages ""for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety to another"", but it is limited to electronic communications and appears to give rise to no civil liability.



 



	I do not consider that this is a case where it can be said that Parliament has intervened in such terms that the common law should, as it were, keep out. After all, Parliament has not legislated so as to cover, or to suggest disapproval of, claims in tort based on ""one-off"" distressing statements as in 
Wilkinson 
and 
Janvier
. On the contrary, the last 20 years have seen legislation which actually suggests that the legislature considers it appropriate for the courts to be involved, albeit in relatively limited and extreme cases, where words are used offensively.



 



	This does not, of course, mean that every untruthful statement, threat or insult could give rise to a claim. Because of the importance of freedom of expression and of the law not impeding ordinary discourse, there must be a second and demanding requirement which has to be satisfied before liability can attach to an untruth, an insult or a threat which was intended to, and did, cause distress, but would not otherwise be civilly actionable. Lady Hale and Lord Toulson have suggested a test of ""justification or reasonable excuse"" in paras 74-76 above, and I have used the adjective ""gratuitous"" in para 106 above. Neither description is ideal as it can be said to be question-begging (virtually every threat, untruth or insult can be said to be unjustified, inexcusable and gratuitous), and it involves a subjective assessment. There may be something to be said for the adjectives ""outrageous"", ""flagrant"" or ""extreme"", which seem to have been applied by the US and Canadian courts (discussed in paras 69-71 above). Of course, even with a test of outrageousness a subjective judgment will be involved to some extent, but that cannot be avoided.



 



	As mentioned, it seems to me to be vital that the tort does not interfere with the give and take of ordinary human discourse (including unpleasant, heated arguments, whether in domestic, social, business or other contexts, sometimes involving the trading of insults or threats), or with normal, including trenchant, journalism and other writing. Inevitably, whether a particular statement is gratuitous must depend on the context. An unprompted statement made simply because the defendant wanted to say it or because he was inspired by malice, as in 
Janvier
, or something very close to malice, as in 
Wilkinson
, may be different from the same statement made in the course of a heated argument, especially if provoked by a series of wounding statements by the defendant. Similarly, it would be wrong for this tort to be invoked to justify relief against a polemic op-ed newspaper article or a strongly worded and antipathetic biography, save in the most unusual circumstances. The tort should not somehow be used to extend or supplement the law of defamation.



 



	Thirdly, I consider that there must be an intention on the part of the defendant to cause the claimant distress. This requirement might seem at first sight to be too narrow, not least because it might appear that it would not have caught the defendant in 
Wilkinson
: he merely intended his cruel statement as a joke. However, the fact that a statement is intended to be a joke is not inconsistent with the notion that it was intended to upset. How, it might be asked rhetorically, could Mr Downton not have intended to cause the apparently happily married Mrs Wilkinson significant distress by falsely telling her that her husband had been very seriously injured? That was the very purpose of the so-called joke. There are statements (and indeed actions) whose consequences or potential consequences are so obvious that the perpetrator cannot realistically say that those consequences were unintended.



 



	Intentionality may seem to be a fairly strict requirement, as it excludes not merely negligently harmful statements, but also recklessly harmful statements. However, in agreement with Lady Hale and Lord Toulson, I consider that recklessness is not enough. In truth, I doubt it would add much. Further, in practice, recklessness is a somewhat tricky concept. Quite apart from this, bearing in mind the importance of freedom of expression and of the law not sticking its nose into human discourse except where necessary, it appears to me that the line should be drawn at intentionality.



 



	I am inclined to think that distressing the claimant has to be the primary purpose, but I do not consider that it need be the sole purpose. The degree of distress which is actually intended must be significant, and not trivial, and it can amount to feelings such as despair, misery, terror, fear or even serious worry. But it plainly does not have to amount to a recognised psychiatric disease (even if such disease is an essential ingredient, as to which see below). It is, I think, hard to be more specific than that.



 



	Fourthly, the statement must, I think, be directed at the claimant in order to be tortious. In most cases this will add nothing to the requirements already mentioned. However, I would have thought that a statement which is aimed at upsetting a large group of addressees, without any particular individual (or relatively small group of individuals) in mind, should not be caught.



 



	Then there is the question as to whether a claimant can only bring an action if he suffers distress to a sufficient degree to amount to a recognised illness or condition (whether psychological or physiological - assuming that the distinction is a valid one). Like Lord Hoffmann in 
Wainwright v Home Office 
[2003] UKHL 53
, 
[2004] 2 AC 406
, I consider that there is much to be said for the view that the class of potential claimants should not be limited to those who can establish that they suffered from a recognised psychiatric illness as a result of the actionable statement of the defendant.



 



	Such a limitation seems to have been imposed by Kennedy J at pp 672-673 in 
Dulieu
, when he referred to ""terror"" which ""operates through parts of the physical organism to produce bodily illness"". However, that was a case involving a negligent act, and, as already explained, I am unconvinced that it involved the same tort as 
Wilkinson
, although it was relied on by Kennedy J. It would seem that the reasoning in 
Dulieu
 was consistent with the principle that damages for distress in negligence are only recoverable for a ""recognisable psychiatric illness"" and not merely for ""grief and sorrow"", as Lord Denning MR put it in 
Hinz v Berry 
[1970] 2 QB 40, 42-43, an approach which was followed by Lord Bridge of Harwich in 
McLoughlin v O'Brian
 
[1983] 1 AC 410
, 437.



 



	This limitation appears to have been imposed in cases of negligence as a matter of policy, and it has been justified in a number of cases on the ground that grief and distress are part of normal life, whereas psychiatric illness is not – see eg 
McLoughlin
 at p 431 per Lord Bridge and 
White v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police
 
[1999] 2 AC 455
, 465 per Lord Griffiths. The Australian High Court has justified the rule by reference to the undesirability of encouraging litigation – see 
Tame v New South Wales
 
(2002) 211 CLR 317
, para 194 per Gummow and Kirby JJ. However, in some negligence cases, it appears that damages for distress falling short of psychiatric illness may be recoverable – see the observations of Brooke LJ in 
Robinson v St Helens Metropolitan Borough Council
 
[2002] EWCA Civ 1099
, paras 36-37. And, as is pointed out in 
McGregor on Damages 
(19th ed) (2014), paras 5-012 and 5-013, injury to feelings is taken into account when assessing general damages in claims, by way of example, for assault, invasion of privacy, malicious prosecution and defamation.



 



	As I see it, therefore, there is plainly a powerful case for saying that, in relation to the instant tort, liability for distressing statements, where intent to cause distress is an essential ingredient, it should be enough for the claimant to establish that he suffered significant distress as a result of the defendant's statement. It is not entirely easy to see why, if an intention to cause the claimant significant distress is an ingredient of the tort and is enough to establish the tort in principle, the claimant should have to establish that he suffered something more serious than significant distress before he can recover any compensation. Further, the narrow restrictions on the tort should ensure that it is rarely invoked anyway.



 



	In the light of article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, it is appropriate to consider the jurisprudence of the Strasbourg court. This is a case which involves a purely common law issue, but the common law should be generally consistent with the Convention and it would be arrogant to assume that there may be no assistance to be gained from the Strasbourg jurisprudence – see Lord Reed's illuminating analysis in R (
Osborn) v Parole Board
 
[2013] UKSC 61
, 
[2014] AC 1115
, paras 56-63. In that connection, there have been a number of cases where the Strasbourg court has been called on to rule on the compatibility of a ruling of a national court or tribunal that an offensive statement was unlawful. A number of those decisions were summarised in 
R (Gaunt) v Office of Communications
 
[2011] EWCA Civ 692
, 
[2011] 1 WLR 2355
, paras 25-30. They all involved statements made in public, but some of them involved statements which had been held unlawful because they were personally insulting. I do not think that these cases take matters much further for present purposes, other than to confirm the vital nature of freedom of expression, the consequent requirement to ""establish"" that there is a cause of action ""convincingly"", the importance of taking into account the context, and the need for proportionality both in deciding whether there is a cause of action and in determining the sanction.



 



	The final point I should make is that this case has been argued in this court on the basis that the issue between the parties has to be resolved according to English law, rather than the law of the US, where the claimant resides. It may well be that that is right (as the Court of Appeal held), or that, even if United States law is in fact applicable, it is the same as our law.



 



	In all these circumstances, it seems to me clear, even at this interlocutory stage, that the claimant's case plainly fails all but one of the requirements of the tort on which it is said to be based. While there is some (disputed) evidence that they could cause the claimant serious distress, the contents of the defendant's book are not untrue, threatening or insulting, they are not gratuitous or unjustified, let alone outrageous, they are not directed at the claimant, and they are not intended to distress the claimant. Accordingly, I have no hesitation in agreeing that the appeal should be allowed, and the order of Bean J striking out the claim restored.",2015-05-20 00:00:00,UK Supreme Court
